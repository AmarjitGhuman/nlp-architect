The	O

they	O

what	O

you	O
have	O
to	O
send	O
the	O
whole	O

,	O
too	O
bad	B-OP

so	O
sad	B-OP

The	O
Macbook	O
arrived	O
in	O
a	O
nice	B-OP
twin	B-ASP
packing	I-ASP
and	O
sealed	O
in	O
the	O

,	O
all	O
the	O

works	O
great	B-OP

It	O
was	O
okay	B-OP
for	O
over	O
a	O
week	O
before	O
the	O
blue	O

started	O
occuring	O
again	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
have	O
to	O
call	O
the	O

at	O
all	O

So	O
buyer	O
beware	O
when	O
buying	O
Toshiba	O

Of	O
course	O
,	O
I	O
inspected	O
the	O
other	O

clearly	O
their	O

tighter	O
and	O
I	O
even	O
demonstrate	O
the	O
difference	O
between	O
my	O
netbook	O

others	O

Then	O
the	O
system	B-ASP
would	O
many	O
times	O
not	O
power	B-ASP
down	I-ASP
without	O
a	O

I	O
have	O

no	B-OP

with	O

to	O
resolve	O
this	O

It	O
was	O
weird	B-OP

you	O
wo	O

the	O

a	O

I	O

why	O
I	O

done	O
in	O

on	O

I	O
was	O

more	O

allow	O
you	O
to	O
convert	O
your	O

I	O

when	O

why	O
not	O

it	O

I	O

I	O
feel	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
poorly	B-OP

because	O
once	O

for	O

DO	O
NOT	O
BUY	O

buy	O
a	O

Not	O
to	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
same	O
reasons	O
as	O
most	O
PC	O

:	O
the	O
price	B-ASP
,	O
the	O
overbearing	B-OP
restrictions	O
of	O

lack	B-OP

I	O
do	O
not	O
recommend	B-OP

everything	O

sub-par	B-OP
from	O

was	O

ran	B-ASP

and	O
had	O
no	O

Finally	O
decided	O
to	O
try	O
a	O

because	O
there	O
were	O
too	O

EVERYONE	O

The	O

You	O

I	O

note	O
that	O
sometimes	O
it	O

the	O

I	O
took	O
the	O

into	O

I	O
purchased	O
it	O

they	O
kept	O
it	O

I	O

It	O
's	O

They	O
break	B-OP
down	I-OP
just	O
as	O
often	O
as	O

do	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
only	O
reason	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
get	O

is	O
because	O
no	O

they	O
're	O
not	B-OP

This	O

This	O

is	O
absolutely	O
AMAZING	B-OP

probably	O
the	O

if	O
your	O

I	O
suggest	O
you	O
get	O
something	O
better	O

it	O
has	O
times	O
were	O
it	O
freezes	B-OP
for	O
10	O

then	O
starts	O
again	O

lots	B-OP

extra	O
space	B-ASP

the	O
keyboard	B-ASP
is	O
ridiculously	O

only	O
good	B-OP

is	O

The	O

the	O

a	O

The	O

in	O
Late	O

it	O
completely	O

I	O

they	O

the	O

I	O

in	O

After	O

stopped	B-OP
working	I-OP
(	O
3	O

was	O
frustrating	B-OP

Yet	O
my	O

My	O
favorite	B-OP
part	O

this	O

I	O

it	O

a	O

the	O
mountain	B-ASP

that	O

security-prone	B-ASP
OS	I-ASP

The	O
#	O
1	O
reason	O

a	O

other	O
than	O
not	O

I	O

it	O

OK	B-OP

They	O
definitely	O

a	O

They	O
are	O
by	O

the	O

actually	O

The	O

That	O

Prior	O
to	O
this	O

350	O
more	O

It	O
had	O
a	O
seventeen	B-ASP

which	O
I	O
wanted	O

but	O
I	O
did	O
n't	O
realize	O
at	O
the	O

it	O
would	O
be	O
such	O
a	O

Its	O
not	O
just	O
slow	B-OP
on	O

its	O
slow	B-OP

Another	O
THREE	O

:	O
I	O
love	O
newegg	O

I	O
recommend	O
them	O
to	O
the	O

however	O
this	O
is	O
just	O
unacceptable	O

It	O
is	O
easy	B-OP
to	O
use	O
,	O
fast	B-OP
and	O
has	O
great	B-OP

for	O
the	O
money	O

I	O
shipped	O
out	O
on	O
Saturday	O

July	O
17	O

Speakers	B-ASP
do	O
n't	O
get	O
that	O
loud	O
,	O
but	O
good	B-OP
enough	I-OP
.	O

I	O
constantly	O
had	O
to	O
send	O
my	O
laptop	O
in	O
for	O
services	B-ASP
every	O
3	O
months	O
and	O
it	O
always	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
same	O
problem	B-OP
that	O
they	O
said	O
they	O
had	O
already	O
fixed	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
made	O
better	B-OP
,	O
thicker	B-OP
,	O
and	O
all	O
out	O
tough	O
!	O

I	O
am	O
now	O
making	O
a	O
point	O
to	O
avoid	O
their	O
products	O
and	O
I	O
hope	O
my	O
experience	O
can	O
serve	O
as	O
a	O
warning	O
to	O
you	O
as	O
well	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
computer	O
has	O
been	O
on	O
for	O
several	O
minutes	O
,	O
it	O
will	O
occasionaly	O
just	O
go	O
off	O
by	O
itself	O
.	O

I	O
bought	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
dedicate	O
a	O
small	B-OP
,	O
portable	B-OP
laptop	O
to	O
my	O
writing	O
and	O
was	O
surprised	B-OP
to	O
learn	O
that	O
I	O
needed	O
to	O
buy	O
a	O
word	B-ASP
processing	I-ASP
program	I-ASP
to	O
do	O
so	O
.	O

The	O
keyboard	B-ASP
is	O
top	B-OP
notch	I-OP
.	O

Processor	B-ASP
-	O
When	O
compared	O
to	O
my	O
3	O
week	O
old	O
Early	O
2011	O
edition	O
there	O
I	O
barely	O
experience	O
any	O
difference	O
in	O
performance	B-ASP
(	O
2.3	O
GHz	O
v/s	O
2.4	O
GHz	O
)	O
.	O

So	O
i	O
would	O
not	B-OP
reccomend	I-OP
anyone	O
buying	O
this	O
computer	O

Two	O
times	O
with	O
in	O
one	O
month	O
.	O

This	O
system	O
is	O
not	B-OP
worth	I-OP
the	O
money	O
or	O
trouble	O
trying	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
fix	O
.	O

Not	O
to	O
mention	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
your	O
mac	O
comes	O
fully	B-OP
loaded	I-OP
with	O
all	O
necessary	B-OP
basic	O
programs	B-ASP
.	O

Again	O
.	O

The	O
biggest	O
problem	B-OP
is	O
that	O
the	O
box	O
had	O
no	B-OP
instructions	B-ASP
in	O
it	O
.	O

This	O
can	O
be	O
annoying	O
at	O
first	O
but	O
you	O
just	O
have	O
to	O
train	O
yourself	O
not	O
to	O
to	O
start	O
over	O
so	O
far	O
.	O

The	O
bottom-line	O
is	O
that	O
this	O
laptop	O
just	O
is	O
n't	O
worth	B-OP
it	O
.	O

The	O
acer	O
one	O
compuer	O
is	O
a	O
great	B-OP
computer	O
.	O

I	O
'm	O
so	O
glad	B-OP
I	O
purchased	O
a	O
Mac	O
and	O
not	O
another	O
PC	O
!!!	O

it	O
's	O
just	O
a	O
great	B-OP
toy	O
to	O
have	O
around	O
.	O

Since	O
I	O
purchased	O
my	O
Toshiba	O
netbook	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
very	O
pleased	B-OP
with	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
a	O
laptob	O
and	O
a	O
desktop	O
.	O

The	O
computer	O
is	O
so	O
slow	B-OP
,	O
even	O
after	O
paying	O
staples	O
the	O
extra	O
money	O
to	O
speed	O
it	O
up	O
.	O

its	O
as	O
advertised	O
on	O
here	O
....	O
.	O
it	O
works	B-ASP
great	B-OP
and	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
waste	O
of	O
money	O
!	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
find	O
a	O
phone	O
number	O
anywhere	O
to	O
call	O
an	O
actual	O
live	O
person	O
for	O
tech	B-ASP
support	I-ASP
and	O
had	O
to	O
result	O
the	O
their	O
online	B-ASP
chat	I-ASP
.	O

The	O
Toshiba	O
Satellite	O
has	O
been	O
more	B-OP
than	I-OP
I	I-OP
expected	I-OP
for	O
the	O
price	B-ASP
.	O

Sadly	O
Apple	O
has	O
discontinued	O
this	O
MacBook	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
never	O
super	O
popular	O
since	O
it	O
fell	O
somewhere	O
in	O
between	O
the	O
cheapest	O
white	O
model	O
and	O
the	O
smaller	O
Pros	O
.	O

Ok	O
,	O
this	O
is	O
probably	O
the	O
best	B-OP
laptop	O
series	O
ever	O
devised	O
by	O
Apple	O
.	O

I	O
bought	O
it	O
from	O
HSN	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
"	O
bundled	O
"	O
with	O
extra	O
software	B-ASP
,	O
but	O
as	O
it	O
turns	O
out	O
,	O
that	O
software	B-ASP
just	O
crashes	B-OP
it	O
more	O
often	O
.....	O

(	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
Windows/Linux	O
user	O
before	O
this	O
)	O
I	O
love	B-OP
the	O
size	B-ASP
because	O
the	O
screen	B-ASP
is	O
big	B-OP
enough	O
for	O
what	O
I	O
use	O
it	O
for	O
(	O
Internet	O
,	O
artwork	O
)	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
it	O
is	O
small	B-OP
enough	O
to	O
be	O
reasonably	O
portable	B-OP
.	O

People	O
know	O
what	O
they	O
are	O
talking	O
about	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
pride	O
in	O
the	O
product	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
selling	O
.	O

If	O
you	O
have	O
much	O
higher	O
expectations	O
than	O
that	O
...	O
I	O
would	O
look	O
elsewhere	O
.	O

When	O
i	O
finally	O
held	O
it	O
in	O
my	O
hands	O
i	O
kissed	O
it	O
,	O
yes	O
i	O
did	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
I	O
started	O
using	O
Google	B-ASP
Chrome	I-ASP
,	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
better	B-OP
,	O
but	O
it	O
freezes	B-OP
too	O
sometimes	O
.	O

This	O
has	O
happened	O
three	O
times	O
so	O
far	O
.	O

I	O
'	O
v	O
spent	O
as	O
much	O
for	O
shipping	B-ASP
as	O
I	O
would	O
to	O
buy	O
a	O
new	O
netbook	O
--	O
of	O
course	O
a	O
different	O
brand	O
.	O

I	O
ordered	O
my	O
2012	O
mac	O

after	O
being	O
disappointed	B-OP
with	O
spec	B-ASP
of	O
the	O

27	O
"	O
Imacs	O

I	O
am	O
used	O
to	O

with	O

so	O
I	O
am	O
having	O
a	O
little	O
difficulty	O
finding	O
my	O
way	O
around	O
.	O

I	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
using	O
that	O
slot	B-ASP
again	O

Even	O
with	O
virus	B-ASP
protection	I-ASP
,	O
it	O
always	O
turned	O
off	O
when	O
updates	B-ASP
were	O
needed	O
and	O
installed	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
a	O
laptop	O
as	O
my	O
regular	O
computer	O
,	O
but	O
found	O
that	O
disconnecting	O
it	O
and	O
lugging	O
it	O
around	O
was	O
a	O
drag	O

I	O
made	O
the	O
right	B-OP

so	O
we	O
got	O
a	O
good	B-OP
deal	O
on	O

an	O

we	O

you	O
will	O
not	O

sorry	O
at	O
all	O

I	O
was	O
amazed	B-OP
at	O
how	O

For	O
those	O
that	O

about	O

this	O
thing	O
does	O
n't	O
really	O
make	O
any	O

this	O
is	O
my	O
second	O
one	O
and	O
the	O
same	O
problem	O
,	O
bad	B-OP
video	B-ASP

overall	O
,	O
this	O
will	O
be	O
my	O
second	O
time	O
returning	O
this	O

to	O
best	O

Well	O
I	O
spilled	O
something	O
on	O
it	O
and	O
they	O
replaced	O
it	O
with	O
this	O
model	O
,	O
which	O
gets	O
hot	B-OP
and	O
the	O
battery	B-ASP
does	O
n't	O
make	O
it	O

There	O
is	O
no	O

Again	O
in	O

my	O

completely	B-OP

the	O
point	O
that	O
it	O

I	O
contacted	O

to	O
get	O
it	O

my	O

it	O
took	O
about	O
3	O

fighting	O

it	O
seemed	O

It	O
suddenly	O
can	O
not	O
work	B-ASP

no	O

with	O
their	O

and	O
maybe	O
because	O
