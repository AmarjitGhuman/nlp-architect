.	O

So	O
i	O
would	O
not	B-OP
reccomend	I-OP
anyone	O
buying	O
this	O
computer	O

Two	O
times	O
with	O
in	O
one	O
month	O
.	O

This	O
system	O
is	O
not	B-OP
worth	I-OP
the	O
money	O
or	O
trouble	O
trying	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
fix	O
.	O

Not	O
to	O
mention	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
your	O
mac	O
comes	O
fully	B-OP
loaded	I-OP
with	O
all	O
necessary	B-OP
basic	O
programs	B-ASP
.	O

Again	O
.	O

The	O
biggest	O
problem	B-OP
is	O
that	O
the	O
box	O
had	O
no	B-OP
instructions	B-ASP
in	O
it	O
.	O

This	O
can	O
be	O
annoying	O
at	O
first	O
but	O
you	O
just	O
have	O
to	O
train	O
yourself	O
not	O
to	O
to	O
start	O
over	O
so	O
far	O
.	O

The	O
bottom-line	O
is	O
that	O
this	O
laptop	O
just	O
is	O
n't	O
worth	B-OP
it	O
.	O

The	O
acer	O
one	O
compuer	O
is	O
a	O
great	B-OP
computer	O
.	O

I	O
'm	O
so	O
glad	B-OP
I	O
purchased	O
a	O
Mac	O
and	O
not	O
another	O
PC	O
!!!	O

it	O
's	O
just	O
a	O
great	B-OP
toy	O
to	O
have	O
around	O
.	O

Since	O
I	O
purchased	O
my	O
Toshiba	O
netbook	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
very	O
pleased	B-OP
with	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
a	O
laptob	O
and	O
a	O
desktop	O
.	O

The	O
computer	O
is	O
so	O
slow	B-OP
,	O
even	O
after	O
paying	O
staples	O
the	O
extra	O
money	O
to	O
speed	O
it	O
up	O
.	O

its	O
as	O
advertised	O
on	O
here	O
....	O
.	O
it	O
works	B-ASP
great	B-OP
and	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
waste	O
of	O
money	O
!	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
find	O
a	O
phone	O
number	O
anywhere	O
to	O
call	O
an	O
actual	O
live	O
person	O
for	O
tech	B-ASP
support	I-ASP
and	O
had	O
to	O
result	O
the	O
their	O

The	O
Toshiba	O
Satellite	O
has	O
been	O
more	B-OP
than	I-OP
I	I-OP
expected	I-OP
for	O
the	O
price	B-ASP
.	O

Sadly	O
Apple	O
has	O
discontinued	O
this	O
MacBook	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
never	O
super	O
popular	O
since	O
it	O
fell	O
somewhere	O
in	O
between	O
the	O
cheapest	O
white	O
model	O
and	O
the	O
smaller	O
Pros	O
.	O

Ok	O
,	O
this	O
is	O
probably	O
the	O
best	B-OP
laptop	O
series	O
ever	O
devised	O
by	O
Apple	O
.	O

I	O
bought	O
it	O
from	O
HSN	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
"	O
bundled	O
"	O
with	O
extra	O
software	B-ASP
,	O
but	O
as	O
it	O
turns	O
out	O
,	O
that	O
software	B-ASP
just	O
crashes	B-OP
it	O
more	O
often	O
.....	O

(	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
Windows/Linux	O
user	O
before	O
this	O
)	O
I	O
love	B-OP
the	O
size	B-ASP
because	O
the	O
screen	B-ASP
is	O
big	B-OP
enough	O
for	O
what	O
I	O
use	O
it	O
for	O
(	O
Internet	O
,	O
artwork	O
)	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
it	O
is	O
small	B-OP
enough	O
to	O
be	O
reasonably	O
portable	B-OP
.	O

People	O
know	O
what	O
they	O
are	O
talking	O
about	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
pride	O
in	O
the	O
product	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
selling	O
.	O

If	O
you	O
have	O
much	O
higher	O
expectations	O
than	O
that	O
...	O
I	O
would	O
look	O
elsewhere	O
.	O

When	O
i	O
finally	O
held	O
it	O
in	O
my	O
hands	O
i	O
kissed	O
it	O
,	O
yes	O
i	O
did	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
I	O
started	O
using	O
Google	B-ASP
Chrome	I-ASP
,	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
better	B-OP
,	O
but	O
it	O
freezes	B-OP
too	O
sometimes	O
.	O

This	O
has	O
happened	O
three	O
times	O
so	O
far	O
.	O

I	O
'	O
v	O
spent	O
as	O
much	O
for	O
shipping	B-ASP
as	O
I	O
would	O
to	O
buy	O
a	O
new	O
netbook	O
--	O
of	O
course	O
a	O
different	O
brand	O
.	O

I	O
ordered	O
my	O
2012	O
mac	O
mini	O
after	O
being	O
disappointed	B-OP
with	O
spec	B-ASP
of	O
the	O
new	O
27	O
"	O
Imacs	O
.	O

I	O
am	O
used	O
to	O
computers	O
with	O
windows	B-ASP
so	O
I	O
am	O
having	O
a	O
little	O
difficulty	O
finding	O
my	O
way	O
around	O
.	O

I	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
using	O
that	O
slot	B-ASP
again	O
.	O

Even	O
with	O
virus	B-ASP
protection	I-ASP
,	O
it	O
always	O
turned	O
off	O
when	O
updates	B-ASP
were	O
needed	O
and	O
installed	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
a	O
laptop	O
as	O
my	O
regular	O
computer	O
,	O
but	O
found	O
that	O
disconnecting	O
it	O
and	O
lugging	O
it	O
around	O
was	O
a	O
drag	O
.	O

I	O
made	O
the	O
right	B-OP
decision	O
.	O

so	O
we	O
got	O
a	O
good	B-OP
deal	O
on	O
hsn	O
for	O
an	O
ascer	O
notebook	O
and	O
we	O
bought	O
it	O
for	O
him	O

This	O
ai	O
n't	O
it	O

Stop	O
living	O
in	O
the	O
stone	O
age	O
and	O
buy	O
a	O
mac	O
,	O
you	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
sorry	O
at	O
all	O
!!	O

I	O
was	O
amazed	B-OP
at	O
how	O
fast	B-OP
the	O
delivery	B-ASP
was	O

For	O
those	O
that	O
care	O
about	O
noise	B-ASP
this	O
thing	O
does	O
n't	O
really	O
make	O
any	O
;	O

this	O
is	O
my	O
second	O
one	O
and	O
the	O
same	O
problem	O
,	O
bad	B-OP
video	B-ASP
card	I-ASP
unreliable	B-OP
overall	O
,	O
this	O
will	O
be	O
my	O
second	O
time	O
returning	O
this	O
laptop	O
back	O
to	O
best	O
buy	O
.	O

Well	O
I	O
spilled	O
something	O
on	O
it	O
and	O
they	O
replaced	O
it	O
with	O
this	O
model	O
,	O
which	O
gets	O
hot	B-OP
and	O
the	O
battery	B-ASP
does	O
n't	O
make	O
it	O
through	O
1	O
DVD	O
.	O

There	O
is	O
no	O
cd	B-ASP
drive	I-ASP
on	O
the	O
computer	O
,	O
which	O
defeats	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	O
keeping	O
files	O
on	O
a	O
cd	O
.	O

Again	O
in	O
February	O
my	O
computer	O
completely	B-OP
failed	I-OP
to	O
the	O
point	O
that	O
it	O
could	O
not	O
load	O
Windows	B-ASP
so	O
I	O
contacted	O
Acer	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
fixed	O
thru	O
my	O
Warrenty	B-ASP
and	O
it	O
took	O
about	O
3	O
days	O
fighting	O
on	O
the	O
phone	O
with	O
agents	B-ASP
and	O
it	O
seemed	O
as	O
though	O
NONE	O
of	O
them	O
spoke	O
English	O
.	O

It	O
suddenly	O
can	O
not	O
work	B-ASP
.	O

no	O
complaints	O
with	O
their	O
desktop	O
,	O
and	O
maybe	O
because	O
it	O
just	O
sits	O
on	O
your	O
desktop	O
,	O
and	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
carry	O
it	O
around	O
,	O
which	O
could	O
jar	B-OP
the	O
hard	B-ASP
drive	I-ASP
,	O
or	O
the	O
motherboard	B-ASP
.	O

The	O
i5	B-ASP
blows	O
my	O
desktop	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
when	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
rendering	O
videos	O

This	O
is	O
my	O
second	O
laptop	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
head	O
and	O
shoulders	O
above	O
my	O
first	O

so	O
i	O
called	O
technical	B-ASP
support	I-ASP

The	O
screen	B-ASP
is	O
bright	B-OP
and	O
clear	B-OP

the	O
operating	B-ASP
system	I-ASP
is	O
solid	B-OP
and	O
friendly	B-OP
to	O
a	O
novice	O

So	O
this	O
review	O
might	O
be	O
a	O
tad	O
bit	O
bias	O
.	O

With	O
in	O
weeks	O
of	O
purchasing	O
my	O
computer	O
is	O
began	O
to	O
slow	B-OP
down	I-OP
.	O

This	O
computer	O
had	O
exactly	O
the	O
specifications	B-ASP
I	O
needed	O

They	O
only	O
stay	O
charged	B-ASP
a	O
little	O
over	O
an	O
hour	O

That	O
's	O
how	O
frustrating	B-OP
it	O
was	O
.	O

The	O
built-in	B-ASP
webcam	I-ASP
is	O
great	B-OP
for	O
Skype	O
and	O
similar	O
video-chat	O
services	O

Screen	B-ASP
is	O
awesome	B-OP
,	O
battery	B-ASP
life	I-ASP
is	O
good	B-OP

My	O
last	O
laptop	O
gave	O
me	O
a	O
constant	O
battle	O
even	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
also	O
completely	O
new	O
.	O

Super	O
light	B-OP
,	O
super	O
sexy	B-OP
and	O
everything	O
just	O
works	B-ASP
.	O

Setting	B-ASP
would	O
change	O
for	O
some	O
reason	O
,	O
the	O
screen	B-ASP
size	I-ASP
would	O
change	O
on	O
it	O

the	O

and	O
whatnot	O

I	O

Could	O

and	O
finally	O
the	O
hard	B-ASP

I	O
have	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
programs	B-ASP
that	O
were	O
on	O
my	O

So	O
this	O
is	O
very	O
good	B-OP
commputer	O
and	O
i	O
highly	O
suggest	O
it	O

The	O
improvements	O
to	O
the	O
OS	B-ASP
have	I-ASP
been	I-ASP
relatively	I-ASP

The	O
Dell	O

has	O
a	O

which	O
I	O

The	O
Toshiba	O

I	O
am	O
using	O
is	O
easier	B-OP
to	O
use	B-ASP
than	O
most	O
I	O
have	O
tried	O
.	O

while	O
the	O
keyboard	B-ASP
itself	O
is	O
alright	B-OP
,	O
the	O
plate	B-ASP
around	O
it	O
is	O
cheap	B-OP
plastic	I-OP

makes	O
a	O

Who	O

I	O

I	O

a	O

that	O
I	O

me	O
(	O
even	O
after	O
