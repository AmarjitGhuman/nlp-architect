they	O

Then	O
the	O

I	O
paid	O
about	O
18000	O

this	O
laptop	O
because	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
bells	O

it	O
kept	O
crapping	O
out	O
on	O

I	O
am	O
enjoying	B-OP
it	O
and	O
the	O
quality	B-ASP
it	O
provides	O
is	O
great	B-OP

The	O
laptop	O
is	O
relatively	O
simple	B-OP
to	O
use	B-ASP

though	O
I	O
bought	O

which	O
is	O
well	B-OP
worth	I-OP
$	O

But	O
,	O
Mac	O
makes	O
the	O
switch	O
from	O
PC	O

easy	B-OP

So	O

,	O
it	O
's	O
an	O

-	O
no	B-OP
better	I-OP

no	B-OP

I	O
replaced	O

But	O
until	O
now	O

no	O

is	O
why	O
I	O

it	O
is	O
an	O
amazing	B-OP

it	O
too	O
is	O

I	O
looked	O
at	O
the	O

it	O
said	O
updating	O
but	O
the	O
asked	O
for	O
a	O

I	O
realize	O
that	O
not	O
every	O

the	O
ones	O
that	O
do	O
can	O

So	O
this	O
was	O
great	B-OP
for	O
me	O

The	O
only	O
bad	B-OP
thing	O
about	O
it	O
is	O
they	O
give	O
you	O
the	O
worst	B-OP
batteries	B-ASP
possible	O

Finally	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
reach	O
a	O

It	O
was	O
just	O
one	O
problem	B-OP
after	O
another	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
's	O
reason	O
we	O
had	O
forked	O

so	O
much	O
money	O
was	O
so	O
we	O
would	O
n't	O

anything	O

First	O
of	O
all	O
yes	O
this	O
is	O
a	O

it	O

that	O
nice	B-OP

Very	O
light	B-OP

easily	B-OP

I	O
had	O
to	O
install	B-ASP

it	O
took	O
a	O

two	O

I	O

it	O

it	O
is	O
perfect	B-OP

I	O
had	O
it	O
four	O

my	O

No	O

However	O

my	O

realized	O
that	O
the	O

is	O
a	O
bit	O
loose	B-OP
(	O
when	O
you	O

the	O

This	O
is	O
my	O
first	O

but	O
had	O
very	B-OP
good	I-OP
experience	O
through	O
previous	O

Let	O
me	O
start	O
off	O
by	O
saying	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
highly	O
reluctant	B-OP
to	O
spend	O
so	O
much	O
money	O
on	O
a	O
laptop	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
suggest	O
this	O
product	O
to	O
anyone	O
.	O

I	O
've	O
had	O
it	O
for	O
about	O
2	O
months	O
now	O
and	O
found	O
no	O
issues	O
with	O
software	B-ASP
or	O
updates	B-ASP

Nightly	O
my	O
computer	O
defrags	O

runs	O
a	O

Just	O
What	O
I	O
Needed	O
For	O
Portable	O

My	O

Too	O
!	O

Then	O
,	O
within	O
5	O
months	O
,	O
the	O
charger	B-ASP
crapped	B-OP
out	O
on	O
me	O

I	O
've	O
owned	O
this	O

for	O
less	O
then	O
two	O
months	O
,	O
already	O
the	O
mouse	B-ASP
button	I-ASP
has	O
broke	B-OP

Also	O
the	O

are	O
not	O
very	O
loud	B-OP
,	O
But	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
netbook	O

Good	O
luck	O
with	O
your	O
purchase	O
options	O

It	O
has	O
everything	O
I	O
would	O
need	O
for	O
a	O
home	O
computer	O

I	O
do	O
not	O
know	O
for	O

From	O
the	O
build	B-ASP
quality	I-ASP
to	O
the	O
performance	B-ASP
,	O
everything	O
about	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
sub-par	B-OP
from	O
what	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
expected	O
from	O
Apple	O
.	O

The	O
computer	O
itself	O
was	O
fast	B-OP
,	O
ran	B-ASP
smoothly	B-OP
,	O
and	O
had	O
no	O
problems	O
.	O

Finally	O
decided	O
to	O
try	O
a	O
MAC	O
because	O
there	O
were	O
too	O
many	O
choices	O
of	O
which	O
PC	O
's	O
to	O
buy	O
and	O
EVERYONE	O
who	O
had	O
a	O
MAC	O
said	O
"	O
buy	O
a	O
MAC	O
"	O
.	O

The	O
only	O
downfall	B-OP
is	O
the	O
volume	B-ASP
control	I-ASP
.	O

You	O
may	O
need	O
to	O
special	O
order	O
a	O
bag	B-ASP
.	O

I	O
enjoy	O
having	O
apple	O
products	O
.	O

Though	O
please	O
note	O
that	O
sometimes	O
it	O
crashes	B-OP
,	O
and	O
the	O
sound	B-ASP
quality	I-ASP
isnt	O
superb	B-OP
.	O

Also	O
is	O
portable	B-OP
and	O
reliable	B-OP
.	O

I	O
took	O
the	O
computer	O
into	O
Best	O
Buy	O
where	O
I	O
purchased	O
it	O
and	O
they	O
kept	O
it	O
over	O
night	O
to	O
study	O
it	O

I	O
was	O
not	O
aware	O
that	O
this	O

can	O
not	O
display	O

that	O
contain	O
Flash	O

It	O
's	O
so	O
useable	B-OP
and	O
responsive	B-OP
.	O

They	O
break	B-OP
down	I-OP
just	O
as	O
often	O
as	O
PCs	O
do	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
only	O
reason	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
get	O
viruses	O
,	O
is	O
because	O
no	O
one	O
makes	O
viruses	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
're	O
not	B-OP
better	I-OP
in	O
any	O
way	O
,	O
they	O
are	O
worse	B-OP

try	O
finding	O

they	O

It	O
is	O
so	O
great	B-OP
,	O
I	O
can	O
Hardly	O
ever	O
take	O
my	O

off	O
it	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
much	O
more	O
streamlined	B-OP
system	O
for	O
adding	O

using	O
the	O

and	O
doing	O
other	O

everyone	O

on	O
a	O

Well	B-OP

I	O
really	O

but	O
its	O
very	O
pricey	B-OP

It	O
's	O
slow	B-OP
and	O
one	O
day	O
i	O
hope	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
money	O
to	O
get	O
rid	O
of	O
it	O
and	O
buy	O
something	O
else	O

I	O
love	B-OP
it	O
and	O
the	O
change	O
in	O

that	O
came	O
with	O
it	O

I	O
waited	O
to	O
review	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
it	O

what	O
it	O
is	O

But	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
recommend	B-OP
this	O

After	O
5	O

requested	O
a	O

it	O

I	O

The	O

I	O

really	O
impressed	B-OP

for	O
the	O

I	O

glad	B-OP

I	O
've	O
had	O

I	O

I	O
really	O
do	O
love	B-OP
it	O
and	O
I	O
'm	O
happy	B-OP
it	O
was	O
economical	B-OP

I	O
'm	O
finally	O
able	O
