The	O
only	O
drawback	B-OP
is	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
little	O
pricey	B-OP
.	O

Prices	B-ASP
are	O
higher	B-OP

dine	O
in	O
and	O
their	O
chicken	B-ASP
tikka	I-ASP
marsala	I-ASP
is	O
quite	O
good	B-OP

You	O
ca	O
n't	O
say	O
its	O
cheap	B-OP
because	O
food	B-ASP
is	O
cheaper	B-OP
in	O
Chinatown	O
.	O

A	O

Drawbacks	O
:	O
service	B-ASP
is	O
slow	B-OP
and	O
they	O

But	O
the	O

part	O
about	O

is	O
the	O
late	B-ASP

delightfully	O
free	O
of	O
the	O
BTs	O

My	O
suggestion	O
is	O
to	O
eat	O
family	O
style	O
because	O
you	O
'll	O
want	O
to	O
try	O
the	O
other	O

Some	O

the	O

The	O
