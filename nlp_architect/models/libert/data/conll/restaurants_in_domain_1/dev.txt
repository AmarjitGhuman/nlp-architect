We	O

out	O

in	O
my	O
opinion	O

Every	O

was	O
better	B-OP

the	O
next	O

The	O
food	B-ASP

We	O

It	O
may	O

the	O

warm	B-OP

waitresses	B-ASP
were	O
busy	O
flirting	O
with	O
men	O
at	O
the	O
bar	O

werent	O
very	O
attentive	B-OP
to	O
all	O

The	O
fish	B-ASP
was	O
not	O
fresh	B-OP

Even	O
though	O
its	O

Brooklyn	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
nice	B-OP
cozy	B-OP
place	O
with	O
good	B-OP
pizza	B-ASP

The	O
restaurant	O
was	O
packed	O
at	O

so	O
we	O
waited	O
at	O
the	O
bar	O
for	O
about	O
20	O
minutes	O
before	O
we	O
were	O
seated	O
.	O

Hurley	O
's	O
is	O
terrific	B-OP

Only	O
complaint	B-OP
would	O
be	O
that	O
at	O
an	O
average	B-OP
cost	B-ASP
of	O
$	O
12	O
-	O
$	O
15	O

I	O

I	O

wanted	O
more	O
and	O
complained	O
to	O
the	O

The	O

I	O

To	O
speak	O

you	O
will	O
find	O
hundreds	O

ambiance	B-ASP
that	O
is	O
on	B-OP
par	I-OP
with	O
Alain	O

the	O
food	B-ASP

it	O
must	O
be	O
the	O

Unfortunately	O
,	O
the	O
food	B-ASP
was	O
NOT	O
something	O
to	O
get	O
worked	O
up	O
about	O
.	O

Worth	B-OP
visiting	O
the	O
1st	O

because	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
original	O

On	O
a	O

day	O
it	O
was	O
fabulous	B-OP
to	O
stop	O
in	O
and	O
enjoy	B-OP
lunch	B-ASP
.	O

The	O
manager	B-ASP
claimed	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
compensate	O
us	O
for	O
anything	O
on	O
the	O
bill	B-ASP
which	O
just	O
shows	O
the	O
lack	B-OP
of	O
sophistication	O
from	O
the	O

I	O
stumbled	O
upon	O
this	O
great	B-OP
pizzeria	B-ASP
as	O
I	O
explored	O
my	O

The	O
food	B-ASP
is	O

and	O
the	O

After	O

all	O
over	O
the	O
Kensington	O

-	O
I	O
've	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
the	O
waiters	B-ASP
do	O
n't	O
do	O
for	O
you	O
is	O
wipe	O
your	O
chin	O
when	O
you	O

Food	B-ASP
is	O
usually	O
very	O

We	O

Maybe	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
an	O
unintentional	O
mistake	O
but	O
I	O
've	O
experienced	O
the	O

I	O
do	O
