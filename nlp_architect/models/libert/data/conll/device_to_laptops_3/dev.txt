I	O

The	O
paint	B-ASP
wears	O
off	O
easily	B-OP

to	O
the	O

farther	B-OP

I	O
'	O
ts	O
nice	B-OP

to	O
be	O
honest	O

the	O

the	O

This	O
Mac	O
Mini	O
makes	O
the	O

seem	O

Then	O
the	O

The	O

I	O

Well	O

I	O

After	O
fumbling	O
around	O
with	O
the	O
OS	B-ASP
I	O
started	O
searching	O
the	O

for	O
a	O
fix	O
and	O
found	O
a	O
number	O
of	O

on	O

the	O
issue	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
no	B-OP
luck	I-OP
with	O
staples	O
or	O
HP	O
to	O
resolve	O
this	O
problem	O

I	O
'm	O
glad	B-OP
I	O
bought	O
this	O
laptop	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
worth	B-OP
the	O
few	O
(	O
$	O
100	O
)	O
extra	O
dollars	O
.	O

so	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
computer	O
does	O
not	O
work	B-ASP
on	O
the	O
24	O
twenty	O
fourth	O
day	O
is	O
my	O
fault	O

Unfortunately	O
,	O
Apple	O
's	O
quality	B-ASP
has	O
continued	O
to	O
slide	B-OP

A	O
longer	B-OP
battery	B-ASP
life	I-ASP
would	O
have	O
been	O
great	B-OP
-	O
but	O
it	O
meets	O
it	O
's	O
spec	B-ASP
quite	O
easily	B-OP
.	O

The	O
battery	B-ASP
does	O
n't	O
last	O
long	B-OP
but	O
I	O
'm	O
sure	O
an	O
upgrade	O
battery	B-ASP
would	O
solve	O
that	O
problem	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
SO	O
much	O
fun	B-OP
to	O
play	O
with	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
very	O
annoying	B-OP
.	O

Also	O
,	O
the	O
space	B-ASP
bar	I-ASP
makes	O
a	O
noisy	B-OP
click	O
every	O
time	O
you	O
use	O
it	O

The	O
display	B-ASP
is	O
beyond	O
horrible	B-OP

So	O
this	O
review	O
might	O
be	O
a	O

bit	O

I	O
have	O

So	O
then	O
you	O
may	O
be	O
lucky	O
to	O
get	O
ahold	O
to	O
someone	O
who	O
understands	O
that	O
its	O
no	O
good	O
and	O
they	O
will	O
let	O
you	O
send	O
it	O
back	O
,	O
but	O
of	O

you	O
are	O
taking	O
a	O
chance	O
of	O
them	O
testing	O
it	O
out	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
has	O
happened	O

and	O
they	O
tell	O
you	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
on	O
their	O
side	O
,	O
then	O
you	O
are	O
stuck	O
paying	O

a	O

I	O
