the	O

because	O

it	O

because	O
dim	B-ASP
sum	I-ASP

so	O
you	O
can	O

upon	O
this	O

on	O
my	O

The	O

complaint	O
is	O
the	O

I	O
believe	O
it	O

restaurant	O
but	O
this	O
place	B-ASP
does	O
n't	O
have	O
an	O
upscale	B-OP
feel	O
.	O

Our	O
friends	O
have	O
not	O
arrived	O
yet	O

It	O
was	O
delicious	B-OP

The	O
veal	B-ASP

the	O

Maybe	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
an	O
unintentional	O
mistake	O
but	O
I	O
've	O
experienced	O
the	O
same	O
with	O
other	O
restaurants	O
so	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
appreciate	B-OP
such	O
practice	O

Anyways	O

if	O
you	O
're	O
in	O
the	O

,	O
I	O
would	O
n't	O
waste	O
my	O
time	O
trying	O
to	O

something	O
,	O
rather	O
go	O
across	O
the	O
street	O
to	O
Tamari	O

This	O
place	O
is	O
not	O
worth	B-OP
the	O
prices	B-ASP

Seriously	O
,	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
best	B-OP
all	O
you	O
can	O

As	O
everyone	O
says	O
,	O
the	O
Spicy	B-ASP
Tuna	I-ASP
hand	I-ASP
rolls	I-ASP
are	O
the	O

Not	O
