A little crowded but they move that line really fast!
While the $20 entree range is not overly expensive, in New York City, there is definitely better food in that range, and so Sapphire, despite it's lovely atmosphere, will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return.
I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fine Indian dining experience that is definitely a value for your dollar.
In any event, this is a place I'll be sure to stop by again when I'm in this part of town.
When I visited my friend who lives in the Upper Eastside, she recommended that we go to this restaurant.
And, atlhough tables opened up next to us and we ASKED for a slightly larger space, they left us awkardly seated.
I was very impressed by this low-key upper eastsider and their authentically thai cuisine!!!
This made it obvious that the food wasn't cooked fresh; it was obviously made before hand and then reheated.
Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef.
You are paying for the atmosphere, which is nice, but can be had in numerous places in Bay Ridge.
After a seafood craving, i checked citysearch and chose to go to Fish based on a previous review and the citysearch info.
Fluke sashimi drizzled with jalapeno-lime olive oil, the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish's sweetness.
I had their eggs benedict for brunch, which were the worst in my entire life, I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was.
The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard.
Other apetizers and food
i went in one day asking for a table for a group and was greeted by a very rude hostess.
Look elsewhere.
The $72 Delmonico steak had to be sent back because it was not cooked to order.
It's true, you feel like your in a scene from Goodfellas.
A gentleman, maybe the manager, came to our table, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order.
Plus, when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy Saturday night, the owner sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over!
Bravo, Blue Hill!
Great burgers, grilled cheeses and french fries.
Last time I went here, the waitress didn't come back after taking our order.
I never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it.
Three page wine menu, one page entree and horedevous.
I wouldn't mind going back some time, but not before trying others nearby.
Unbelievable.
The decor is designed in a contemporary Japanese style restaurant.
They pray to their Food Gods to make them into a good pizza like VT's.
The atmosphere takes you to that place, the place many dream of.
Unbelievable.
Like I said, Nick and Joe's may not be everyone's favorite, but it's mine.
In the evening, this place attracted a well dressed, with it, NY crowd.
My wife and I went to Water's Edge for a romantic dinner.
The buffet had a nice selection.
If the omakase is to showcase technique and variety, serving almost 40% of items BBQ-ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not-so-fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance.
Once you become a regular, you are treated as one.
THE SERVICE IS AMAZING, i've had different waiters and they were all nice, which is a rare thing in NYC.
The service is great (maybe even borderline nagging but at least you get attention), the desserts are excellent and the coffee is so very good...
Big thumbs up!
I'm almost tempted to give this place a bad review so I can keep the crowds away...been going there on and off for a year now and it's really my fave hang out in the city.
The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome, great appetizer to share!
This is the Cheers of New York, whether you've ever been there or not.
The chocolate raspberry cake is heavenly- not too sweet, but full of flavor.
Sit outside in the warm weather; inside for cozy winter.
Sure enough, exactly 30 minutes later we got the call and were seated promptly.
For some reason, all the seafood on the menu was unavailable except for the Salmon.
I got the $10 10-piece dim sum combo, every bite of which was great.
There's another girl who I can't describe, she is about 5'6" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about. 
the bestt!
The flavors are very fresh and pretty inobtrusive, nothing flashy.
The lunch special is an asbolute steal.
It's usually packed for good reason, esp.
Good French restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you're into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at Katz' Deli, or Mexican food which is supplied by capable restaurants.
Haru on Park S is simply disgusting.
If you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde.
We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods.
it is not consistent.
supercilious scorn is in.
Also get the Onion Rings -- best we've ever had.
Definately check it out!!!
we did notice however, that some tables had what looked like pita instead of naan.
If you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde.
This place is not worth the prices.
Then, to top things off, she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend's jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes. 
This is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed.
I would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard.
Always good drinks and service is pretty good;
Would recommend - perfect for those looking for a place close to grand central.
They were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior.
I would highly recommend it.
Nice value.
This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York.
I've had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times, when I have been in the neighborhood.
But that wasn't the icing on the cake: a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had.
I hate this.
Definitely not worth the price!
The food was just awful, ATROCIOUS actually.
I read the other review and have to say I had the opposite experience here last Sunday.
The food arrived 20 minutes after I called, cold and soggy.
Great food, good size menu, great service and an unpretensious setting.
sometimes i get bad food and bad service, sometimes i get good good and bad service.
I would highly recommend this place to everyone for any occasion!
He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine.
I went there 2times .
Disappointing food, lousy service.
Best Indian Restaurant in the City
We go often.
When we notified him that he didn't mention the specials, he didn't apologize but let us know that we made a very good decision regardless.
What you are paying for is the environment and the name.
This establishment is the real deal. 
They bring a sauce cart up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your steak (I tried them ALL).
The sandwhiches are out-of-this world!
highly recommended.
Veal Parmigana - Better than Patsy's!
The sauces used are also not that exciting.
Worse of all, $60 was erroneously added to our $80 bill.
With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care.
I come here enjoy very much with husband.
They are FAST.
The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing!
I've been to this monster sushi twice, the 46th st once, the 23rd st one a number of times.
We've been to Grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed.
It is bland and nothing extrodinary.
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested.
Try sushimi cucumber roll.
First of all Dal Bukhara Rocks.
Came looking for this place because I heard good things.
It's better than being on the roof of Sutton Place with 19 year old interns jabbing you in the ribs all night.
I don't think I would go again.
They have an excellent selection (the rolls with crab are really great).
I had the best ravioli ever.
This is the MOST wonderful restaurant in all of New York City, not just Brooklyn...
Okay-i don't mind the oily part (cause most are cooked that way) but it was way too bland.
this without question is one of the worst hotdogs i have ever had.
Went inside and I started to get excited.
When we sat, we got great and fast service.
We refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore.
I would recommend Roxy's for that, but not for their food.
The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic, just simple, small and sparse.
But the thing that my wife and I hated was it was so loud and it felt like 'bar' or 'pub'.
But the staff was so horrible to us.
Good cake BUT: it was not the best cake i've ever had, and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked employees.
The rest of the dim sum, though pricey by Chinatown standards, is worth it.
The view is breathtaking the service is top notch... the ambiance is wonderfull.
The staff has always been friendly without seeming grating, and the chef has greeted us on a couple of occasions.
She just nodded and walked off.
Beware of the chili signed food items not unless you want to call the fire department to douse the flames in your mouth.
Grilled whole fish wonderful, great spicing.
Go here.
The service is a bit slow, but harkens back to my years growing up in Napoli, Italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night.
They might be all business at the counter when you give your order, but their food says I love you.
Great sushi experience.
The food is yummy, especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries.
The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance.
(Besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city).
Food is usually very good, though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders.
Go only if you are already in the neighborhood and don't want to bother going farther for a better place.
Overall, excellent restaurant!
The service varys from day to day- sometimes they're very nice, and sometimes not.
Another review here claimed the pre-fix was $29/per person including sake but it is $55 per person not including sake.
The fried rice is really good too.
First of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review.
Authentic Taiwanese food that's cheap... what more could you ask for?
Mazing interior.
The catch is that you are charged extra for ANYTHING that you leave on your plate so don't be a greedy pig!
Nothing fancy but really good food with pretty reasonable price.
The frizzy retro girl (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink. 
My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it.
The staff was knowledgeable and full of personality.
Just remember, the later you go, the longer you may have to wait.
We started with the scallops and asparagus and also had the soft shell crab as well as the cheese plate.
And, the honey BBQ rib tips are yummy!
Located at the end of a magnificent block.
I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere!
Decor is charming.
I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night.
While the prices are nothing special, the portions are huge.
I've been here twice now.
But $500 for a dinner for two that didn't include Wine?
We, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude.
The waiters were very professional, courteous and attentive.
even the wine by the glass was good.
Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end, not one person takes responsibility for anything.
wont come back again for sure!
Stay away from this place.
The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu, present your meal, and attend to your needs.
The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes.
He not only makes his own homemade mozzarella, but every pie is ultra fresh.
Going to Bark is always worth the train ride, and will make your tongue and belly very happy!
If this restaurant was in Manhattan, I would definitely go more often.
Nice for one time special occasion.
less wait time for me!
With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored .
After so many great reviews here, my bf and I went to Esca to celebrate my birthday last nite.
I cannot imagine better Indian food in all of the city.
Went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and appetizers.
Their coffee is quite good too!
The food here is rather good, but only if you like to wait for it.
Sandwiches, burgers and salads, like the lemon-dressed cobb, are classic successes.
The food is very good and the service is great.
The food is delicious and the bar has a great vibe.
This place is greatly welcome in the desolate little strip between the Prospect Expressway and Greenwood Cemetery - a wasteland we like to call The Sliv.
For being number 1, this place has alot of work to do in order to truly earn its so called reputation.
What a pleasant surprise!
The service was excellent - friendly and attentive.
The service was on point - what else you would expect from a Ritz?
I would highly recommend this place!
I would highly recommend it.
They are extremely rude, not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some drinks adn their pita bread!
I always find myself sitting next to someone in the theatre industry- interesting to hear ideas hashed out while having a quick bite to eat.
at taj, vegetarians can rejoice-all the dishes are manna from heaven.
At 5 dumplings for $1, you just cannot go wrong.
Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service, which was boarderline rude.
You can also special order any kind of dumpling,etc.
The food was delicious and the waiter was incredibly helpful and attentive (considering we were the only ones there for the first hour).
They're are better Taiwanese restaurants and they are located in Flushing, Queens.
Downtown Dinner 2002 - Prixe fix: Appetizers were ok, waiter gave me poor suggestion..try the potato stuff kanish best one.
you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review.
Me and my girls will definitely go back.
The crispy chicken wasn't for us, though.
Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet, where greasy, dry and tasteless are complimentary.
The music which is sometimes a little too heavy for my taste.
Perhaps.
(The sashimi is cut a little thinly.
The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.
Been there, done that, and New York, it's not that big a deal.
Trust me.
Try ordering from the regular menu, then you would not regret!
I cannot imagine better Indian food in all of the city.
good food good wine that's it.
We didn't even see a menu, as our waiter described both the specials and the main dishes.
Thank you everyone at Water's Edge.
fine dining restaurant quality.
All toppings are so fresh you'd think they had their own vegetable garden and the crust is so perfect, that one actually thinks of how it was made.
I complained to the waiter and then to the manager, but the intensity of rudeness from them just went up.
I do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy.
Don Pedro's is one of my favorite restaurants.
Over the years, it has always provided a pleasurable dining experience with quality food and wine.
I had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz. of Maine Lobster in it.
While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.
The waitress remembers me and is very friendly, she knows what my regular is and that's the fried mini buns with the condensed milk and the assorted fruits on beancurd.
The wine list is extensive and impressive.
The food, served in small tasting portions (as an option) is very good with each dish being better than the next.
Please take my advice, go and try this place.
If you can handle that, it's a great place for a business dinner, fun with friends or simply a table for 2.
I go back in line like three times on average until I can't walk anymore.
The food is great and reasonably priced.
The atmosphere is warm, comfortable, artsy and sexy.
In fact there is only one I've tried that even compares (shabu Tatsu) and even then I prefer Dokebi.
Really, I find it rather scandalous that such a crappy restaurant attracts such crowds--this, in the city of a million restaurants, at least 9/10 of which are way better than this one.
This isn't your corner Chinese food takeout.
I absolutely love this place!!!
But after last night, Spice Grill is the only place I'm eating indian cuisine.
There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table.
There was a great deal for 6 Blue Point oysters and a beer or glass of wine for $8!
Go to Volare for 1st class service and terrific food.
Wow.
However it is the ONLY Taiwanese restaurant in town.
It is not worth for that bucks.
Everything is very cheap.
Seating is ok even though sometimes there's alot of people.
The cold sesame noodles, which are a freebie when you order $10+, are delectable.
Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town!
For some reason the place was empty when we got in and remained so for the entire evening, I don't understand why but we had a blast and will definately go back the next time we are in the area.
This place was the worst.
Otherwise, this place has great service and prices and a nice friendly atmosphere.
The food was good overall. 
The vibe is very relaxed and cozy, service was great and the food was excellent!
Immediately after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys are outta here.
The food here was great, a treat from beginning to end.
The food is good, I can't lie.
Lucky Strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat.
The food is great and the environment is even better.
The two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place.
Beef noodle soup is good as well.
I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time.
I have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us.
I think I've had some the best meals of my life at minnow.
Chicken teriyaki had tomato or pimentos on top??
It may be a bit packed on weekends, but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area.
It's the kind of place I like to support!
This restaurant was way overhyped.
I cannot recommend OG more highly if I tried - check it out for yourself.
Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that.
Salads are a delicious way to begin the meal.
The eggplant parmesan is also great, and my friend who grew up in Manhattan claims that no one serves a better baked ziti with meatsauce.
Nicky the Nose at the bar is a treat.
A guaranteeed delight!
This is the pinnacle of Indian Fast Food (all fast foods in my opinion).
The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful.
One of us actually liked the expresso - that's it.
This is one of the best comfort food places in the city.
My friend from Milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian.
Only complaint would be that at an average cost of $12-$15 per meal, I'd like not to have to worry about finding a seat!
Ruth, mother of the Bride
The food's as good as ever.
Good creative rolls!
Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room (no matter what the size of your party), the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters- you'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you're in.
Highly recommended!
Unfortunately, unless you live in the neighborhood, it's not in a convenient location but is more like a hidden treasure.
Dishes denoted as "Roy's Classics" (marked on the menu with asterisks) are tried-and-true recipes, such as macadamia-crusted mahi mahi, or subtly sweet honey-mustard beef short ribs.
Sushi so fresh that it crunches in your mouth.
The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared.
My only problem is that you are literally sitting on top of the people next to you!
Ok, so the servers wander around a little clueless, but there's more than enough servers for the crowd they get -- it's fine, you just have to make a small effort to get their attention.
black white shakes came out good also.
Delish and made to your liking!
I won't go back unless someone else is footing the bill.
There is not a single place in Chinatown where you have a nice neighborhood feeling like here.
Small servings for main entree, i had salmon (wasnt impressed) girlfriend had chicken, it was good.
We waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right.
Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience.
This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time.
The bill is approximately $25 for 2 at lunch without drinks.
I have never had cheescake like this.
so garantuan that you can't fit them in a toaster.
This is some really good, inexpensive sushi.
After 2 tries by the waiter to take it away (we hadn't even looked at it yet, we had full beers yet to drink), the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations.
What more can you ask for?
Good for dates or with friends.
She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.
The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention.
The farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty.
Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them.
Then, IF they answer the phone, you're lucky if they don't hang up on you!
A quintessential slice of NYC pizza.
lobster was good, nothing spectacular.
The staff is very good.
These innovators of french indian fusion do a great job of making dishes as interesting as possible while still being accessible.
it was a very warm experience.
Cool atmosphere but such a let down.
Skip this restaurant, it's a big disappointment.
If you like seafood and/or Greek food you will love this place though it is not limited to just these things.
I felt as though I were eating in Paris.
No doubt the next time we want to go out for a special occasion or are entertaining guests from out of town, Spirit and Bateaux will be our destination.
I have been going back again and again.
love the food.
Maybe it has improved since then?
Recommendations, of course, are required!
Try the rose roll (not on menu).
The prices are wonderfully low.
Harumi Sushi has the freshest and most delicious array of sushi in NYC.
The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner.
My goodness, everything from the fish to the rice to the seaweed was absolutely amazing.
Some of the workers ignore me and talk to the female customers, other times, they've skipped my order.
Though it's been crowded most times I've gone here, Bark always delivers on their food.
AMAZING MY FAVORITE!!!
The waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet, we were told no...
I would never recommend this place to anybody even for a casual dinner.
It's to die for!
Thanks Bloom's for a lovely trip.
Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away.
Excellent dumplings served amid clean, chic decor.
Volare virgins or weekly regulars, everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly.
His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.
Celebrated my fathers birthday here.
I got enough reasons to keep coming back!!!
There were no communications issues either, as she spoke perfect English.
Service is highly refined: our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress.
They have a very diverse menu so its something for everybody.
My wife and I will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them, as they tend to offer large portions.
Considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time, the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed.
The service was ok.
Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for a first date.
Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee.
The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well.
The service is good and the resturant is clean.
Check out the secret back room.
While the food was excellent, it wasn't cheap (though not extremely expensive either).
The portions are HUGE, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and entree per person) for two people.
Unfortunately, we chose this spot for lunch as we had done a lot of walking and ended up at the South St Seaport.
I had the tuna tartare with sake, mushroom ravioli with pinot noir, and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $49.
The service is great, my soup always arrives nice and hot.
Next time, we wouldn't dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks.
My GF and I dine at Bukhara often as she lives near it.
I love to visit Murrays for my bagel fix.
Even when the chef is not in the house, the food and service are right on target.
Probably my worst dining experience in new york, and I'm a former waiter so I know what I'm talking about.
I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A. 
I never write on these sites but this restaurant is def worth commending!
MMMMMMMMMmmmmmm so delicious
To speak of the Park Side, words can not describe.
SO SO SO SO SO good!
Moving on.
I had a grat time at Jekyll and Hyde!
They have homemade pastas of all kinds -- I recommend the gnocchi -- yum!
Maitre-D-"Eat and get out"
The soup is pretty good too.
I highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try.
Ambience is so cute and quaint, good for business although we were there on vacation.
It doesn't look appetizing as it's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black, but the taste was phenomenal.
I didn't complain, I liked the atmosphere so much.
A beautiful atmosphere, perfect for drinks and/or appetizers.
I do not recommend.
If you don't mind all that noise then go to the Chart House.
I've had better chicken at BBQs!!!!
The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices.
by dinner time, they turn it around and mount a huge comeback!!
The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.
Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot, once you enter the unmarked wooden doors, the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you’re no longer in the city.
You will not be missing anything.
Perhaps this food is considered extreme to an Upper East Side resident, but for the rest of us who've actually eaten ethnic food, this is simply dull.
Also, the hostess called me today to thank us for coming and mentioned how she hoped that my girlfriend enjoyed her birthday - unexpected, but a truly above and beyond thing to do...
The food was great and the service was even better.
i love their chicken pasta cant remember the name but is sooo good
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place.
I've had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times, when I have been in the neighborhood.
Anyways, if you're in the neighborhood to eat good food, I wouldn't waste my time trying to find something, rather go across the street to Tamari.
We got most of it back at home with us.
We were told that the wait was about twenty minutes and there would be no problem for our 8:00 pm curtain call.
We were very surprised by how good the food was on our first visit here on a Sunday night.
Succulent steaks cooked precisely to your desired 'doneness' accompanied by salads and sides that don't look like leafy road kill.
I went for restaurant week.
it was really good pizza.
Especially liked chicken tikka and the naan, and the dals.
This place is always very crowded and popular.
But too far east!
Bill a little high, but worth it.
I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try.
I found the food to be outstanding, particulary the salmon dish I had.
There restaurant is very casual, but perfect for lunch, and their delivery service is always very fast.
Price is high but the food is good, so I would come back again.
I'm looking forward to going back soon and eventually trying most everything on the menu!
It's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone.
The staff was extremely friendly and pleasant.
The service was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served.
The best Chicken pad tai, I've ever had.
Baluchi's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices.
You'll pay at least double at any other Italian restaurant in the city, and most still don't compare.
The dim sum servings here are a bit larger than I'm used to.
When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.
This place has the best pizza.
They're terrific!!
I had the Pad Thai and the noodles were sticky.
We usually just get some of the dinner specials and they are very reasonably priced and very tasty.
Very, very nice
Great Indian Food!
This place has realy fresh sushi and a nice large menu of Japanese classic cuisine.
Food was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly, but I can say this is one of the best I've had.
I never had an orange donut before so I gave it a shot.
Taking Hot Dogs to the next level
Tuk Tuk is one of the rare choices for me to go in Brooklyn.
This restaurant was recommended by a local...as a matter of fact, he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed!
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty. hmmm.
I plan on stopping by next week as well.
Nice value.
I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries.
We had crawfish boiled and despite making a mess, it was a ton of fun and quite tasty as well.
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money.
We had great desserts (including the best cannoli I've ever had) and then they offered an after dinner drink, on the house.
You fellas above says its the best Taiwanese restaurant in town.
However, it just so happens that there's an even more amazing place just down the street.
I am surprised to say the least and find such practice not worth the effort.
I don't remember what we had; nothing was memorable.
skip dessert.
How can they survive serving mediocre food at exorbitant prices?!
I REALLY ENJOYED THE SHOWS PUT ON BY THE ACTORS.
I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try.
Too bad the food wasn't of the same heritage.
This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a  restaurant, the food.
THE SERVICE IS PERFECT TOO  NOTHING WRONG IN THIS ITALIAN/FRENCH RESTAURANT
You can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience, but for superb food at reasonable prices, La Villa can't be beat.
A beautifully designed dreamy Egyptian restaurant that gets sceney at night.
The food is amazing... especially if you get the Chef's tasting menu and your favourite bottle (or two!) of wine from an extensive selection of wines.
The sauce may not be for everyone, since it is distintive.
But the main hit was the whole grilled fish.
This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down.
Eating in, the atmosphere saves it, but at your desk, it's a very disappointing experience.
I don't know about you guys, but when I go somewhere to eat I go for the food not for the atmosphere.
Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there.
The Pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down, it was a pleasurable experience.
Try the Pad Thai, it's fabulous and their prices are so cheap!
fine dining restaurant quality.
Amazing!
Prices are very good.
The prices are not terrible.
However, it is jus too good to not praise it.
For authentic Thai food, look no further than Toons.
Decent Thai food in cute - though a bit dank - little Nolita hangout, BUT service terrible.
Priced at upper intermediate range.
Ess-A-Bagel (either by Sty-town or midtown) is by far the best bagel in NY.
The dishes came out around 5 minutes apart.
When my husband and go there, we spend $60.00 (have LOBSTER TAILS UMMMMM need I say more) I can't say any more, it a place you'll never forget If you never go, you'll miss A Meal of your life time
The food is terrible and overall, I would have to say avoid at all costs.
We have been to this place many times, and always have great food, wine, and service.
Have frequented 'ino for several years and the food remains excellent.
I'm not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and I all enjoy Mizu very much... and we're repeat customers.
The wait staff was loud and inconsiderate.
The one up front will smile and say What can I get for you, brother?
I LOVE their Thai
However, the food and service and dramatically lacking.
The entree was also very good.
I have gone back to Siam Square many times since and everytime I am very satisfied overall.
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm.
This Thai restaurant is a couple blocks away from Sripraphai (another delicious Thai restaurant).
Great restaurant, and even greater food!
Hurley's is like Cheers where everyone knows your name and they are ACTUALLY glad you came.
By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant.
The food is fresh, delicious, and reasonably priced.
Everything about this place is adorable - even the bathroom!
Wasn't going to share but I feel obligated...while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing.
Pizza here is consistently good.
Went here last night - nice decor, good service, but the food was surprisingly excellent.
The sides were ok and incredibly salty.
Not only would I not recommend Jimmy's restaurants to friends, I would strongly suggest they go anywhere but.
I don’t usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but I’ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable dinner.
Desserts are almost incredible: my personal favorite is their Tart of the Day.
$160 for 2 filets, 2 sides, an appetizer and drinks.
Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon, which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave.
It may be a bit packed on weekends, but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area.
Always great service!
All we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner.
Fish is so very fresh.
Will never be back.
We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria, but facing away from the bar when we turned back around, the $2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it.
A beef Consomme.
I love Ess-a-bagel, but I live on the west side, so I often go to Murray's for convenience.
Not a small feat for good french food in the area.
Will give it another chance before I write it off.
So what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food.
I am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience.
The lack of AC and the fact that there are a million swarming bodies (although everyone is polite and no one is pushing) is a slight turn off.
Stay away from the latter since you won't go for seconds (hint hint).
The wait staff was very attentive and polite.
Once they ran out of Gnochi and made it for me from scratch!
I haven't eat a lamb chop as delicious as that,the salads are really nice dressed with lemon and extra virgnin olive oil.
Anyway, the owner was fake.
There's candlelight and music.
What is even better, is that the prices are very affordable as well, and the food is really good.
They never came back to refill our glasses again.
Cornelia Street looks like a Broadway set for West Side Story and the inside of Po is so cool quaint you really can't top the setting for a romantic dinner in NYC.
The quantity is also very good, you will come out satisfied.
The atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking, which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors.
My girlfriend and I just spent our 10 month anniversary at Lou Lou.
The food is wonderful, tasty and filling, and the service is professional and friendly.
If you are going for the food, it will not be worth it.
Great wine list, reasonably priced.--Sara
I generally like this place.
It can be a little confusing as to where one goes to order, but once the food is ordered, you are in for a treat.
You can't go wrong here.
its a little out of the way if you don't live in the neighborhood, but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are.
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines.
THE BANANA PUDDING THEY SERVE HAS NEVER SEEN AN OVEN,THE CRABCAKES ARE WAY OVER SALTED AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THE VERY GREASY MAC AND CHEESE.
My wife had barely touched that mess of a dish.
My husbands was perfect, my was well done and dry.
Restaurant snobs need not bother, this is a small, neighborhood kind of place.
Intimate but charming interior with extremely friendly and attentive service.
And its absolutely DELICIOUS.
The wine the service was very good too.
Wretched and retching
They all know you.
Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away.
Considering their price of $6.25 for lunch special, the dish was ridiculously small.
This place is pricey, and yes, the food is worth it; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price.
THEY HAVE WAITERS ON THE SIDEWALK TRYING TO PULL YOU IN WHICH MADE US SUSPICIOUS.
Fabulous food - if the front of house staff don't put you off – 
P.S. Please don't tell anyone in my family i eat there.
Since I cook for a living, I'm very fussy about the food I eat in restaurants.
My boyfriend ate tuna and it was cooked perfectly!
The only fallback on this restaurant is the prices.
Have been several times and it never dissapoints.
First went here to enjoy their garden terrace.
This is the Jackel and Hideof the restaurants on the UES.
We got in line and were served while in line a bannan fritter.
They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends.
The food is great, service is ok.
The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).
I must say the view of NYC is so beautiful!
Threw my fiance's surprise 30th birthday dinner here couldn't be happier.
I usually go there later at night when I get off work so I don't have to deal with crowds or lines.
The food is reliable and the price is moderate.
Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top.
Over priced, overrated....stay away!
great neighbhorhood spot.
In any event, even though its a bit on the pricey side, we still love this restaurant and will definitely go back.
Go with the specials, and stay away from the salmon. 
Most people eat there seem to be typical Upper East Side snobs, so be aware.
The food is amazing, rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza.
Both a number of the appetizer and pasta specials were amazing.
First walking in the place seemed to have great ambience.
You should pass on the calamari.
I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time.
I have eaten a lot of pizza here.
My favs here are the Tacos Pastor and the Tostada de Tinga...
The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the cheese is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components.
I've lived in NY for 5 years and this place has it all.
Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh, a delicious and sweet tasting bread.
Drinks way over priced.
Tasty steak, pork loin, the works.
Simple comfort food and what hot and lage portions.
The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates.
I don't live in NY but my best friend does.
Fresh, authentic, french cuisine in substantial portions.
And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience.
I would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard.
If your favorite Chinese food is General Tao chicken, then this is NOT your place.
Get the soup and a nosh (pastrami sandwich) for $8 and you're golden.
The staff there is very attentive and down to earth.
then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi.
Could have had better for 1/3 the price in Chinatown.
I loving bringing friends here - and I do so every chance I get.
We always have a delicious meal and always leave feeling satisfied.
The food is good, but very expensive for the casualness of it.
His drinks are very inventive, delicious and classy.
It took a bigger bite from my wallet than my appetite - I would not reccomend this to anyone that I would want to talk to me again!!
And really large portions.
great hot dogs..
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere.
The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes.
Bring your appetites.
While the ambiance and atmosphere were great, the food and service could have been a lot better.
Both the fresh mozzerella slices and the Plain Cheese slice are phenomenal.
The bar drinks were Eh, ok to say the least.
Don't be put off by another reviewers extremely negative review.
No free drink.
Pizza and garlic knots are great as well, I order from them quite often and the delivery is always super quick!
Good luck getting a table.
I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village, and while I do believe their food has slightly slipped in quality, I have been hesitant to be disloyal.
We concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake, both were delicious.
The seafood is amazing, there's a good wine list, and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises.
The food tasted very good.
I was on jury duty, rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome chicken tacos and Hibiscus lemonade.
Great wine selection, Gigondas is worth the price, and the house champagne is a great value.
The service was attentive, yet discreet.
This is one of our all-time favorite.
Cool atmosphere, the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night.
Well...they can run but they can't hide.
i've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine, if not good.
Mizu is the Japenese find in Grammercy.
I showed it to the manager, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for).
I think the meatball parm is good.
The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale.
Its located in greenewich village.
Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that.
and the owner is simply lovely and friendly.
Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return. 
The strong scents coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds.
The food was below average, the service was pathetic, there was no ambience at all.
Cute place, nice wait staff but would never go there again.
Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience.
Very good value
You will not be disapointed at all.
The only weird thing was if we got a bottle, the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price X4, which makes no sense whatsoever.
Did I mention the wine?
I take all my NYC guests to VT's.
It is kinda nosiy and the tables are close together but it's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner.
Molto bene!
To sum it up: Service varies from good to mediorce, depending on which waiter you get; generally it is just average Ok. 
It was pretty inexpensive too.
You must try Odessa stew or Rabbit stew; salads-all good; and kompot is soo refreshing during the hot summer day (they make it the way my mom does, reminds me of home a lot).
Service was on par but not wonderful.
It's simply the best meal in NYC.
Very pleased
I've been living in the Columbia University area for about 10 years with 3 kids - now in their teens.
This place is so much fun.
Quality of food is excellent and price is cheap, stick to pork, fish, chicken, lamb and vegetables.
Consequently, their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them.
The waiters ALWAYS look angry and even ignore their high-tipping regulars.
We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the wait for a table.
Best Pastrami I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous.
It only took about five or so minutes to get an empty table, but standing up wasn't too bad.
Other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced, the atmosphere is filled with energy (and the beautiful people of course) and the food was surprising good!
It's one of our favorite places to eat in NY.
I came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband.
As a Japanese native, I've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years, but I was just so amazed at this place.
This is a twenty-something guy that doesn't mind laying down $300 for a fine and delicious meal for 2 on special occassions.
Pair you food with the excellent beers on tap or their well priced wine list.
THE MOST FUN RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TOO!
Scalina Fedeli reminded me why service is so integral to fine dining.
Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS!
The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree.
They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies.
I read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself, but may be it is worth it.
We happened upon this place purely by accident and were pleased with the results.
Big Wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach.
It's charmingly small and that leads to an atmoshere that is extremely cozy and romantic, even.
I love going there!
Try the crunchy tuna, it is to die for.
The boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they're perfect for 2 people.
I had to wait for my friend at the bar for a few minutes
Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top.
When he finally did, he was unable to make a gin and tonic -- couldn't find tonic.
Don't get me started on the margaritas, either.
I just don't understand all the hype...
If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines,please check their wine list.
My daughter and I left feeling satisfied (not stuffed) and it felt good to know we had a healthy lunch.
The decor is very simple but comfortable.
LOVE the atmosphere - felt like I was in Paris.
Entrees: Vanison steak and Bison Steak.
I have been to Roth's twice and both times were very disappointing.
We were seated and ignored by waitstaff.
The owners and employees are friendly and their pizza is fantastic.
The service is not consistently excellent -- just decent.
during happy hour!
It took them 15 minutes to put water in our glasses.
It's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend.
I love and I know gourmet food by excellence!
The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean.
We were charged full price.
The staff is very kind and well trained, they're fast, they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks, they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations.
however, it's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
The food was actually aweful.
Other guests enjoyed pizza, santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips.
Be sure not to get anything other than bagels!..
I loved it and would go again.
The room is a gorgeous, bi-level space and the long bar perfect for a drink.
The food came out wrong, the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal.
Definitely try the taglierini with truffles - it was incredible.
But WARNING: to all those that use this site be weary, be very weary of recommendations.
for an appetizer, their calamari is a winner.
Never once did I leave feeling unwelcome or impressed.
Although the tables may be closely situated, the candle-light, food-quality and service overcompensate.
A few tips: skip the turnip cake, roast pork buns and egg custards.
but their mac cheese was YUMMY!
Even though the place is not beautiful, the food speaks for itself.
I've been here 3 times for lunch and it is one of my favorites in the city.
And where does Patis go wrong; no where. 
The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food), and made it seem like a big concession.
We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night.
My husband said he could've eaten several more, the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had.
The counter service is bad.
Best meal in a long time!
After waiting for almost an hour, the waiter brusquely told us he'd forgotten to give the kitchen our order.
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect, which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me, i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water, or the check.
This isn't a value joint.
Please take my advice, go and try this place.
The traditional Italian items are great - cheap and served in a cozy setting.
Food was average and creme brulee was awful - the sugar was charred, not caramelized and smelled of kerosene.
I have eaten at some of the 'best' sushi joints in NYC (Nobu, Bond Street, JewelBako, etc) and Yamato is my favorite.
(i hang out, and live, in the neighborhood..) 
Overall, this is a great new restaurant that has been consistently good every time I have been.
A pleasant surprise.
great food, lt's of it, more then one person can eat!
I would recommend Roxy's for that, but not for their food.
The service is awful.
My suggestion is to eat family style because you'll want to try the other dishes.
The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it.
good music, great food, speedy service affordable prices.
Great idea and base for restaurant, but work on the details, people who think this was good need to go back to the shore towns and rethink what it should have tasted like.
The chicken and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection, and the lamb sandwhich is great for heartier appetites.
i know, you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored, but my agenda is i'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends, seeking a pleasant experience.
Lived in Shanghai most of my life and thought the food was comparable to the flagship Green Bo restaurant there.
The fish was really,really fresh.
My boyfriend and I were in NY for a few days and Pastis was a place that came recommended.
All my co-workers were amazed at how small the dish was.
The restaurant was quiet and intimate.
But who says Murray's is anything about service.
Service was prompt, friendly and great.
I love it.
From the moment you enter till the moment you walk out the friendly and helpful staff was was just Fantastic.
Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner.
With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care.
Murray won't do it.
And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).
The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini.
Ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me.
They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends.
great eats, good times.
They are located off the beaten path but are certainly worth the trip.
I grew up on these bagels.
Had a late night dinner on a Saturday night.
I've been to several places for Dim Sum and this has got to be the WORST.
He offers subpar service and has no personality.
Seating is always prompt, though the restaurant does fill up in the evening.
perfect for a quick meal.
Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.
Stay away if you're claustrophobic
Best of all is the warm vibe, the owner is super friendly and service is fast.
Went here on a friend's reccomendation.
The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches.
I've been to Naples 45 for dinner twice.
We weren't!
My boyfriend and I are avid restaurant goers, and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended Flatbush Farms.
Finally!
Over 100 different choices to create your own.
Just an odd group.
The rice to fish ration was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice.
Three strikes and this restaurant is out.
I almost wanted to write a bad review, so no one would ever go here and I could have all the dumplings to myself!
I go at least 3 times a month and have never been disappointed.
All-time favorites include the Big Mac, Chicken McNuggets, Filet-O-Fish sandwich and McDonald's famous french fries; lighter options like entree-sized salads are also available.
The food was exceptional.
Took my mom for Mother's Day, and the maitre d' was pretty rude.
Probably would not go again...
It was good, but was not what I thought it would be.
But that is highly forgivable.
There are other people waiting!
However, I was there for a work dinner not long ago when my colleague from London noticed a very large waterbug on the ceiling.
The overall price tag was very very expensive, something I did expect.
The ambience was nice, but service wasn't so great.
overpriced japanese food with mediocre service
If you want Americanized Chinese food with your usual watery, generic white sauce, this is your place.
My boyfriend and I recently had an early dinner at Artisanal and was satisfied with our experience.
I love the drinks, esp lychee martini, and the food is also VERY good.
Service was among the best I have ever had in NYC.
Highly recommend it!
My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary, and to our surprise it was fantastic.
I went to Kitchenette this weekend for brunch.
Generously garnished, organic grilled burgers are the most popular dish, but the Jerusalem market-style falafel wraps and Mediterranean salads--layered with beets, goat cheese and walnuts--are equally scrumptious.
They kindly brought us more to see if it was better, but it was not!
The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful.
And I hate to say this but I doubt I'll ever go back. 
The best pad thai i've ever had.
There are other people waiting!
The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches.
It was nice and fresh, but I can't give it high scores on being authentic thai.
It's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre food, noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks.
Every course was better than the next.
Delivery is fast too.
The food itself was just ok - nothing spectacular - but the service was awful.
We spent so much time getting elbowed around while we waited we left.
If you love seafood, you would love this place!
Service not the friendliest to our "large party"! 
I had been searching really hard for a restaurant in New York where I could really feel unwanted and ignored and I finally found it!
this is can became on e of the NY Italian Food fare institutions.
$6 and there is much tasty food, all of it fresh and continually refilled.
Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you, but the food doesn't quite match up.
Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem!
The fried dumplings are GREAT!
We walked in on a Wednesday night and were seated promptly.
The omlette for brunch is great...
This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a  restaurant, the food.
My fish was delicious in an incredible curry sauce.
Since my first dinner I have had the chance to have brunch at Orsay 3x.
The food is average: breakfast food, soups, salads, sandwiches, etc.
Filled with suits, though, so you never really feel terribly comfortable.
It was pleasantly uncrowded, the service was delightful, the garden adorable, the food (from appetizers to entrees) was delectable.
Rao's has the best service and atmosphere in NYC.
No, really.
First off, the waitress was completely unattentive the 2 times we saw her(odd in a restaurant with 6 tables) and got our order wrong.
We had Lava Cake... we ordered when our food came it takes at least a 1/2 to make it. 
To top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant.
I reccomend the fried pork dumplings, the orange chicken/beef, and the fried rice.
Compared to Ess-a, Tal offers a less doughy bagel!
the negative reviews on city search are probably from jealous competing restaurants who realize they can't compete with Temple's entire positive attitude about the proper way to treat their customers and deliver top quality food.
Their sake list was extensive, but we were looking for Purple Haze, which wasn't listed but made for us upon request!
Try the mediterranean salad, it is a true experience for your taste buds!!
The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world.
Go here.
Have a mojito and sit in the back patio.
I'm told that it is open 24hrs which is good.
Not a large place, but it's cute and cozy.
Our favorite meal is a pesto pizza, the house salad, and a good bottle of wine.
Probably would not go back here.
too large for just two people but nothing was left.
The menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent.
The food is mostly made from scratch, fresh and well prepared.
My six year old loved it.
Lahore is a great place to duck into late-night when you need some really tasty food on the cheap -- you'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for FOUR DOLLARS.
Don't look down your nose at me like that...
The ambiance was fine, a little loud but still nice and romantic.
This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant.
Worth the trip from Manhattan.
The food is uniformly exceptional, with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating, whether it's on the menu or not.
Any if you have a reservation you'll wait for max 5 minutes - so have a drink at the bar.
enough said!
Hurley's is like Cheers where everyone knows your name and they are ACTUALLY glad you came.
Anyone who ever dined at a thai restaurant is in for a huge disappointment.
Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood.
As soon as my father lifted his pen from the check a chef appeared to usher us out.
Chef Vincenzo, always there if you need him, is a real talent and a real Roman.
Gross food – Wow-
IT IS DEFINITELY SPECIAL AND AFFORDABLE.
Best Italian food I ever had (and being Italian, that means alot).
It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips.
" The menu includes pub fare--burgers, steaks and shepherds pie--and even a portabella lasagna for those black sheep known as "vegetarians.
He was terribly thirsty after the meal too.
The waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal!
Service is fast and friendly.
But don't ever order bacon late at nite (either platter or in sandwiches, for that matter don't from any take out place) as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacos, hurt my molars.
For dinner I had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan.
Top spot in town for Vietnamese classics, better than places that cost a lot more.
The one positive thing I can say is that the service was prompt, we got seated right away and the server was very friendly.
I also ordered the Change Mojito, which was out of this world.
To celebrate a birthday, three of us went to Mare anticipating great food.
And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).
However, there is just something so great about being outdoors, in great landscaping, enjoying a casual drink that makes going to this place worthwhile.
Well, this place is so Ghetto its not even funny.
Just because P Diddy had a party at Butter doesn't mean we should be automatically impressed.
The music was fascinating, but left room for conversation, and the bartender made superb drinks.
I live in the neightborhood and am a regular.
While this isn't classical restaurant fare, the chef has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely Indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burn-outs.
You rarely have to wait for a seat and the currys (masaman, green, red) are full of flavor and come super spicy if you ask for it.
I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends, and spent three enjoyable hours there.
This is a nice sushi restaurant in Brooklyn that's located on 86 street, right underneath the train station.
Once for dinner and once for brunch.
Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table.
Moules were excellent, lobster ravioli was VERY salty!
Went there for an office lunch.
All I can say is they are fantastic.
However, the service is absolutely horrible.
I had their eggs benedict for brunch, which were the worst in my entire life, I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was.
The service varys from day to day- sometimes they're very nice, and sometimes not.
It's very spicy but not offensive.
I've been here twice now.
After dinner, take your date to the HUGE dance floor, probably one of the biggest you'll see in NY.
The food arrived in about 15 minutes. 
I was with a party of 7 (close but not next the the front doors) and we were eating with our coats on.
The fettucino alfredo was amazing.
One of the best, if not THE best, restaurants in Park Slope (and NY in general)
The dim sum however was very good.
When going out for a nice dinner, I like a nice ambiance as well as very good food.
Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES, I get angry that I didn't just go to Zucchero Pomodori.
Quite frankly, this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried.
I keep my fingers crossed the whole subway ride hoping that there will be a table I can sit at by myself and not have to share with the rice congee soup people.
The portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter.
Even the pasta is delicious here (a rarity in New York pizza restaurants).
I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends, and spent three enjoyable hours there.
Result (red velvet): Great texture, soft and velvety, nice hint of cocoa.
David, Daytona Beach, FL
Great food, great decor, great service.
I LOVE their Thai noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST!
Everyone seemed generally happy with their food, except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi, seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice! 
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt).
Service was awful - mostly because staff were overwhelmed on a Saturday night.
I particularly love their yellowfun tuna and their mussel selection.
And really large portions.
Build a meal with side orders like Amazin' Greens salads, Buffalo Chicken Kickers and Cinna Stix.
I choose to go with one of the special, the braised lamb shank in red wine, which was excellent.
This place has the best Indian food in New York, hands down.
The wine selection (by the glass and bottle) is wonderful and I always recommend that friends make a reservation if they're going to be in town.
The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music, and moreover, takes requests.
This lovely French-Asian fusion restaurant stands out amongst other great restaurants on Smith Street.
Worth a visit.
The photobook menu was a cute touch, certainly helped my group and I pick the fried chicken, pork chop, and noodle dishes that we all ordered.
Be careful of portions - they're HUGE.
The food was extremely tasty, creatively presented and the wine excellent.
Nevertheless the food itself is pretty good.
Service is not exactly five star, but thats not really a big deal.
good music, great food, speedy service affordable prices.
Salads were fantastic.
We all felt it was worth it.
Don't be fooled by crowds of people.
Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order.
All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends!
It was not above ordinary and the beef version had cheap (undercooked) beef.
The menu is nothing like the one on the website.
I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently.
We actually gave 10% tip (which we have never done despite mediocre food and service), because we felt totally ripped off.
the teas are great and all the sweets are homemade.
Please be aware that it's CASH or AMEX only!
A little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite.
It's easy to get a table for a large group and you don't get hustled out.
While the menu isn't especially groundbreaking, everything I've tried so far has been well-executed and tasty.
Aside from the Sea Urchin, the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail, Boton Shrimp, Blue Fin Torro (Fatty Tuna), Sea Eel, etc.
So much more than the usual bar food, go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their hand-crafted beers.
At first we were a little taken aback, as this seemed to present a problem, although the restaurant looked fairly empty, but they hastily put the table together for us.
I have to agree with the previous reviewer.
Every time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street.
at night, but it's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the music playing in the background is also voluminous.
The waitress, seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing.
And at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the check was given to our table by knocking over a glass of water.
Get the feeling they settled into a groove a while ago.
Again, no apology, no is there anything else I can get you, no can I get you a drink to make up for it, nothing!!!!
A large is $20, and toppings are about $3 each.
It was delish and I didn't feel bad eating it.
The spicy tuna and salmon are the best we've ever had.
but overall i give it a 10
They specialize in smoothies and fresh juices.
But, they were too big for the bun.
Go there on an empty stomach and leave feeling like a baby Veal Calf(ok bad joke), but you will see.
Turned out there was full service upstairs and sat down.
Just make sure my ice water is kept full and my tea kettle filled with piping hot tea and that's all the service I need...
Food doesn't appear to be cooked on premisis but there's a high turnover so its pretty fresh.
Took my sister here before attending a show one evening.
I have to say that I am pleasantly suprised and I will most likely stop in again if I am in the neighborhood.
I've rarely had a problem with slow staff in the 10 years I've been going.
Ok, for all of us growing up in the Village of NYC, we have spoiled by a plethora of restaurants, most of which stay open very late.
We were sorry to check them off our list as we had enjoyed and recommended the place in the past.
When I called this morning, I didn't think I would be able to get in at 12, but I was able to get in, along with four other guests.
The service, however, is a peg or two below the quality of food (horrible bartenders), and the clientele, for the most part, are rowdy, loud-mouthed commuters (this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff) getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game.
We were on our way back to NJ, and since I am in NY, we figured why not grab some food?
By the time we were done, it was past 1:00am.
It's a really great deal, considering we got full off of four dollars.
Everything a NY pizza joint should be.
Seriously, this place kicks ass.
Such nice people working here - but I have to review the food.
Go there once and oh yes...you will go back...you will...
The price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate.
Check it out, it won't hurt your stomach or your wallet.
The wait staff is very freindly, they make it feel like you're eating in a freindly little european town.
This is the best unknown restaurant in and around New York.
Over all it was a very nice romantic place .
We never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating.
The ambience is very romantic and definitely a good place to bring a date.
The food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare, the dishes are never a disappointment.
Fantastic place.
I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant, and the food was majorly disappointing.
If you're craving for Haru's great food, especially the House Roll, but can't stand the wait building outisde, head across the street to their Sake Bar!
Gigino's in Wagner Park is so enjoyable.
We just ate at Kai and were disapointed.
Great staff.
They forgot a sandwich, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter.
fresh restaurant was amazing........ food was delicious and of course fresh.
The sake menu should not be overlooked!
This is some really good, inexpensive sushi.
Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service.
The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless, so was the seafood tagliatelle.
I would highly recommend.
the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality.
MY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly!
Not too much so, but enough that there's a great scene.
We go on Mondays for the prix fixe and our experience with the food has been comparable to Blue Ribbon.
Not what I wanted to hear.
Everything on the menu is great. 
One thing I liked about this place is that I never felt rushed or pressured to give up my table ot incoming guests.
My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time!
They have authentic Indian at amazin prices.
Service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things (the heavy, black, antique-seeming teapot, for one) in the restaurant experience.
The place was quiet and delightful.
Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon, Sea Bass and Crispy Duck.
$500 included:
We came across this restaurant by accident while at a DUMBO art festival and thoroughly enjoyed our meal.
We ate outside at Haru's Sake bar because Haru's restaurant next door was overflowing.
I don't get it either.
The atmosphere is unheralded, the service impecible, and the food magnificant.
Although I moved uptown I try to stop in as often as possible for the GREAT cheap food and to pay the friendly staff a visit.
So some of the reviews here are accurate about the crowd and noise.
My biggest complaint was the un-tasty food although presented well.
Would NEVER go back there.
The decor is night tho...but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling...its quite un-appetizing, and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern.
If you've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer.
I recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great.
The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn't even fully melted!
The menu has so many fish items and oysters.
Highly recommended to all!
They make the best pizza in New Jersey.
I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever.
for my birthday and we had an excellent time.
Don’t go to this place!
The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry, inedible chicken with terrible sauce.
Authentic Korean food lovers should visit 32nd Street, of course.
Not pretentious and very economical.
The food is surprisingly good, and the decor is nice.
Its a great place for a casual date or to entertain clients for lunch.
Besides, when you have bad service, that's less money you have to tip.
As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!
since i was in the neighborhood, we made sure to give this a try.
Drawbacks: service is slow and they don't toast!
The combination of super-fresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious.
Unless you are eating in the Pizzeria side of this place, and are not in a rush, this place is a bad idea.
less wait time for me!
The food is very good, but not outstanding.
Ambiance- relaxed and stylish.
She gets 10 for her excellent service and advice.
Don't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes, they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections.
Having discovered Ping's on the internet, we entered with qualms but were instantly put to ease by the fish tanks that greet you as u walk in.
The lamb meat was under-cooked and EXTRMELY CHEWY.
This was a great surprise.
The pizza was pretty good and huge.
Delivery is fast too.
Very different than regular dimsum places.
The fish was adequate, but inexpertly sliced.
Stick to the gulab jamun.
Stay far away from this place.
Finally a curry that I can eat, enjoy and not suffer from gastritis from 3 hours later.
There are numerous shavue restaurants in LA, but few out here.
It is so easy to get a reservation at a top place in NYC with a week's notice.
My friend ordered some of their special sushi rolls which had excellent presentation and tasted great!
This particular location certainly uses substandard meats.
Very excited to hear that short-term Chef Jason Narone has moved on, he truly was a low point of their Sterling track record.
I took one bite from the $24 salmon, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.
Authentic Shanghai style and I cannot recommend a better Shanghai place in New York.
Place should also have a 1,2,3 chili rating to be more authentic...
people are rude bit again it's new york!
We were there March 7 and found Maison very nice.
Service ok but unfriendly,filthy bathroom.
Owner is pleasant and entertaining.
It just wasn't Thai.
The food was exceptional.
Service was very prompt but slightly rushed.
The pasta was well cooked, didn't have enough sauce though or flavor.
I ate clams oreganta and spectacular salad with perfectly marinated cucumbers and tomatoes with lots of shrimp and basil.
Best Taiwanese food in NY!
i have eaten here a handful of times, for no reason besides sheer convenience.
Coming from Boston this place is like Emma's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge (although they have more funky toppings!)
The setting is casual and romantic.
THE BIG COMPLAINT: NO TOASTING AVAILABLE.
Delivery service is great too.
The noise level was unbearable, conversation impossible.
We visited Bread Bar during January restaurant week and were so pleased with the menu selections and service.
The service is spotty, sometimes really friendly and sometimes barely there.
Bagels are ok, but be sure not to make any special requests!
The food was mediocre and the service was severely slow.
I can't wait to go back.
The quail was fantastic and unique and the pastas were full of flavor.
Tuk Tuk is one of those comfortable neighborhood joints where you know you will always have a good meal at a fair price.
Service was wonderful;
No one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our plates.
Good for dates or with friends.
Great food at REASONABLE prices, makes for an evening that can't be beat!
I've overheard comments from him to his employees that should not have been delivered in the dining area and I've been sitting there while he lectured another customer.
Chef Waldy's always measures up.
The atmosphere is great!!!
The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals.
A++   The service was good to excellent along with the attitude.
Meat dishes now adorn the selections, although there's still a large number of vegetarian-friendly choices.
Went for Mom's birthday brunch/lunch.
Unbelievable.
I take all my NYC guests to VT's.
My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge!
Just ignore the trendy wannabes.
I love Ess-a-bagel, but I live on the west side, so I often go to Murray's for convenience.
The best thing I tasted were the lambchops.
Service- friendly and attentive.
Planet Thai is great!
We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there, sharing a large Pelligrino, a pizza of two of their specials, one was goat cheese the other blue cheese, and both were excellent.
Unfortunately, the food was NOT something to get worked up about.
The food is wonderful, artfully done and simply delicious.
I wasn't impressed and it wasn't SPICEY????
The staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York.
We've been following chef Lyle's food around New York for 15 years and while remaining classic, his innovations with bistro fare have made us return and return.
I work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time.
Over 100 different choices to create your own.
Old school meets New world.
Believe me, they live up to the name.
Food is average, and I would say even the chain restaurant Baluchi's tastes better.
Just remember, the later you go, the longer you may have to wait.
A fairly late entry into the haute barnyard sweepstakes, Flatbush Farm isn't in the same league as the Blue Hills or even the Farm on Adderlys of the world, but it's pretty good, albeit with a somewhat dismal setting.
Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm, but the open kitchen is part of the charm.
The crackling calamari salad, which is usually a cheap disaster at many restaurants, is crispy and lightly dressed.
It's always quiet because it's awful.
Based on the reviews for dinner, this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that, but definitely not for Dim Sum again.
I think this a a wonderful place.
I went this past Saturday and had a excellent meal of consisting of a braised lamb shank with mashed potatoes.
if you're looking for authentic hong kong-style food, look no further.
The cuisine from what I've gathered is authentic Taiwanese, though its very different from what I've been accustomed to in Taipei.
The drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced.
The lox is always fresh too.
Anyway, the food is good, the price is right and they have a decent wine list.
Since we were already waiting so long, we felt we had no other choice but to accept it.
The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music, and moreover, takes requests.
great food
We order a bit of everything on the menu.
Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable.
So we sat at the bar, the bartender didn't seem like he wanted to be there.
and never strayed.
The Thai food is good.
However, looking at the table next to ours, we both sort of wished we had ordered pizza, which looked PERRRRRRRRRFECT.
The food is authentic Italian - delicious!
Having hunted around for a quiet, romantic, yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot.
Le Pere Pinard has a $15 pre-theater menu that is outstanding.
The service was very attentive and very generous.
i don't usually order wine with indian so i can't comment on their wine list or their wines.
The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day.
It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy, creamy, and slightly buttery.
I can't believe people complain about no cheese sticks?
We were very disappointed.
It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant, with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender, but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere.
Tasty but expensive.
Definitely not a restaurant to skip!
I expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu.
Best Indian Chinese in the city, by far!
Food is great and inexpensive.
I went to Ruby Foo's after work with a group of 6.
The food was good too.
All in all, this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city.
Food-awesome.
So rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary!
) It's not the best Japanese restaurant in the East Village, but it's a pretty solid one for its modest prices, and worth repeat visits.
I must give it Yon out of Yon stars!
their brunch menu had something for everyone.
Chennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city.
It was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York, and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to New York.
I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one.
I did not try the caviar but I tried their salmon and crab salad (they are all good)  
From beginning appetizers, the scallops were incredible, to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sorbet, we were delighted by the taste sensations.
Now we moved out of the state and every visit to NYC includes a stop here.
We had a party in their private room and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning.
They are by far the BEST past in New York.
I ordered from here last week.
I was pleasently surprised at the taste.
The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent.
Great Hot Dogs!
This place is average... at best.
The second you walk through the heavy vault like door, with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime.
I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently.
We went to Ino for Valentines.
Don't waste your time or your money.
However, it is jus too good to not praise it.
Make more tables- perhaps a rooftop bar?
just got back from lunch at Tamarind and it was excellent.
Definite go if you're used to good Indian restaurant food from abroad.
The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service.
Everything from the eggs benedict to the mussels and even the hamburger were done well and very tasty.
I would definitely recommend Mary's and am making it one of my regular neighborhood haunts.
The waitstaff were attentive, polite and helpful - an impressive feat in such close quarters.
You can get an excellent meal at most of the many Indian restaurants on nearby Lexington Avenue for the cost of one the dainty dishes here.
Save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one!
10
Compared to other shabu restaurants around town, this places wins hands-down.
Menus feature seasonal picks, like sweet corn-foie gras brulee.
It's one of our favorite places to eat in NY.
Upon entering, we were greeted by the owners, Steven and Frederick, who went out of their way to be more than gracious hosts.
I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever.
I was pleasantly suprised.
Highly recommended is the Spicy Fried Clam Rolls and Spider Rolls.
The service leaves much to be desired, from feeling like you are rushed the place your order, to being ignored the rest of the night.
A nice find in the neighborhood.
The staff was accomodating, the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely.
The server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile.
The tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent.
Everyone was smiling so that made me feel welcome.
The sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the rasamalai was forgettable.
We'd go back again
This is the first place I've been that a runner remembers my order... hope he likes his job because I have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant.
It's to die for!
I ordered a Chicken Teriyaki dish and found that the chicken was extremely dry.
In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food, this is one of the best spots.
I'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food.
Bagels are ok, but be sure not to make any special requests!
The place is beautiful!
On a recent Sunday afternoon, a friend and I accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT.
I will definetely go back again and again, that's for sure!!!
The food was ok and fair nothing to go crazy.
Try it!
The Italian food has flavor (that can be sort of surprising on the UES), and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive,they sort of remind me of the NY Yankees of the late 90's, no matter how bad it look, you knew that there was a rally just around the corner...
The food is o.k., but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant.
Decor needs to be upgraded but the food is amazing!
Go with a group of friends and you will have a great time.
Very affordable and excellent ambient!
We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful.
The service is ok but could be better.
Overall, the best bagel in town.
The lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it.
There is a real gallery of stars that have visited.
Had a lovely dinner in this dedicated seafood joint, food was well-prepared and -presented and the service was pleasant and prompt.
Another plus is most of the entrees are approx.
Excellent food, although the interior could use some help.
Raga stands out with an interesting fusion of French and Indian cooking.
If you were there when it first opened, give this restaurant a second chance.
Okay service.
So I've never actually been to M proper, but I've had it delivered a few times.
Nice atmosphere, the service was very pleasant and the desert was good.
it is a cozy place to go with a couple of friends.
I was speechless by the horrible food.
for about eleven bucks you get a gigantic burrito (or tacos), margarita, and dessert.
A little noise but I think that was because of our party!
I have been about 4 times and have always had a great meal.
Have eaten at Ginger House several times, and it's always good.
Took my mom for Mother's Day, and the maitre d' was pretty rude.
In fact, this was not a Nicoise salad and was barely eatable.
We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.
The design of the space is good.
The appetizing is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable price (if bought by the pound).
I've waited over one hour for food.
Most of the sandwiches are made with soy mayonaise which is actually pretty good.
Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went.
I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.
Open late (well as late as I ever got there and I'm a night person)
I was very disappointed with this restaurant.
A few tips: skip the turnip cake, roast pork buns and egg custards.
Hats off to the chef.
I love Indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it.
Pizza is terrific, as is homemade pasta.
While the smoothies are a little big for me, the fresh juices are the best I have ever had!
If you're in the neighborhood, definitely stop by for a great meal.
The only other steakhouse that seems to hold a candle to Roth's is the Strip House.
This place is great.
Helpful service and average price per dish $10.
We had fun eating in there, we were there like around 3 a.m. in the morning!
The waiter was attentive.
And evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful.
I have known about this secret for the last 13 years, Emilio(the Godfather) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices.
Great find in the West Village!
Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $10.
I have known about this secret for the last 13 years, Emilio(the Godfather) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices.
I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane.
The pizza is overpriced and soggy.
Small, bright, and clean, BZ Grill stands apart from the usual run of gyro joints, both in Astoria and out.
Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey.
Whether it's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar, you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite.
Oh, and I never write reviews--I just was so moved by how bad this place was, I felt it was my duty to spread the word.
The menu has lots of options: I hope to go back to try those potato pancakes.
Try the green curry!!!
While the staff at this little bistro is very friendly, I have never experienced more incompetency.
Glad you have the luxury to throw out paying customers.
However, once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin.
We've lived in the area for more than 8 years.
My six year old loved it.
An awesome organic dog, and a conscious eco friendly establishment.
We left, never to return.
It was well worth the wait.
So rude.
So, if yo really don't care who is sittingnext to you, which is about 2 inches away, I would say try it.
The lox is always fresh too.
We been there and we really enjoy the food, was areally great food, and the service was really good.
Going to Ballato's is like coming home and eating in my own kitchen, an absolute delight!
I really didn't know what to expect for a restaurant that literally overlooks the main hall of Grand Central.
Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu, though- too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick.
We left, never to return.
Myagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the City; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else.
After I paid for my purchase, I noticed they had not given me utensils so I could eat my pie.
A great place to meet up for some food and drinks...  
The bruschetta and panini's are so yummy!
Oh, and the complimentary pudding dessert was just enough- yummy!
The potato balls were not dry at all... in fact it was buttery.
they really provide a relaxing, laid-back atmosphere.
It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips.
The dessert (we had a pear torte) was good - but, once again, the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions.
Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months.
THE LASAGNA WAS PROBABLY THE BEST I HAVE TASTED.
The vibe is very relaxed and cozy, service was great and the food was excellent!
The staff greeted me warmly at the door and I was seated promptly and the food was excellent.
All pretty good.
The dinner menu is diverse and top-notch as well.
Restaurant with a view
Over time, the food quality has decreased substantially, it is a lot less crowded than it used to, and the service must definitely be part of the reason.
whoever the jazz duo was, they were on POINT.
Went to Cafe Spice with 4 of my friends on a saturday night.
Chance is a small cozy restaurant, with a romantic feel to it, the decor is great.
I'm happy to have Nosh in the neighborhood and the food is very comforting.
The wine is always good, the tapas are always yummy, especially with the warm pita bread.
I've been coming here as a child and always come back for the taste.
we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant, then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers.
At 6:30, we were the third party there.
We were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem.
The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner.
Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place.
It's all about the food !!
Best In ALL of NYC
While this is a pretty place in that overly cute French way, the food was insultingly horrible.
Try the homemade breads.
The most annoying thing, though, is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue.
The food really isn't very good and the service is terrible.
I also ordered for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the order.
But I just would like to say I read the reviews people left and thats why I checked it out.
Yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously, but it shouldn't.
And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic.
Heartland Brewery is a great way to start or finish your day.
Prices are very good.
Great food and the prices are very reasonable.
After all that, they complained to me about the small tip.
The place's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh.
The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.
I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read.
The fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef (usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt).
We had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses!
Our waitress was sweet and accomodating, not overbearing.
We go often for lunch and the place is packed.
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.
After the review I treked into Brooklyn.
After complaining about the chicken dish, the manager came over to tell us that, no one had ever complained before, and that we just didn't know what the dish was supposed to taste like.
Being from the south, there aren't any good delis in my area and while watching Foods across America on PBS I found out about Katz's Deli.
Go hungry and enjoy.
No gimmicks here -- the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation.
also make sure you pay attention to the music being piped in - quite a weird selection.
In mi burrito, here was nothing but dark chicken that had that cooked last week and just warmed up in a microwave taste.
Excellent food for great prices
Nice Family owned traditional restaurant.
We all had the tasting menu and unlike some of the other reviews, I felt there was more than enough food.
All in all, I don't see how you can go wrong.
The jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes.
This quiet dark asian bistro is well worth the trip.
We concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake, both were delicious.
The price very reasonable.
Great beer selection too, something like 50 beers.
Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza (as I love La Pizza Fresca).
This is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the Basil slice.
The steak was very fatty and the sauce was overpowering and not very tasty.
I've had pizza both times and the caprese salad appetizer.
Skip this location and go to the one in Soho.
This place is the most Japanese it can ever get.
If you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo.
Be sure to try the Smoked Trout...Lamb Chops, Veal Chops, Rabbit, the potato gratin, on and on and on...
Wonderful!
the service is prompt friendly.
Besides, we were on vacation!
The pizza's are made fresh, crispy, and ready to serve.
Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers, no matter what the reviews say.
The unfortunate lady next to us thought she had ordered a salad (including asking for salad dressing) and was instead given a quesedilla.
THE FOOD PORTIONS ARE REALLY LARGE.
The flavors robust and subtle.
The price is reasonable although the service is poor.
Each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface, and you get platters of thin sliced meats, various vegetables, and rice and glass noodles.
Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.
Romantic if you want it to be (brightly lit).
I wasn't here for the pizza so I can't comment on that yet but what I had was very good.
But dinner here is never disappointing, even if the prices are a bit over the top.
I CAN EAT HERE EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK REALLY LOL LOVE THIS PLACE ...)
Once for dinner and once for brunch.
So for a filling and healthy meal give it a go.
Best hot dogs in the tri-state area.
We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night.
Their calzones are horrific, bad, vomit-inducing, YUCK.
I'm not picky - but it was actually gross.
Even my Indian friend couldn't believe how good and tasty everything was.
Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights.
$6 and there is much tasty food, all of it fresh and continually refilled.
Would recommend this place as a good date spot if you don't want to drop a ton of cash.
This quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my Manhattan restaurant list.
This place has totally weird decor, stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional...
i'm surprised about some of the bad reviews posted here - i've been to tamarind about 5 or 6 times and always come away extremely satisfied and looking forward to returning.
Thick fries, meaty chili and stuffed baked potatoes round out a menu that includes a cool, ultra-thick chocolate Frosty.
Interesting selection, good wines, service fine, fun decor.
I LOVED THE SHOWS.
one of the best Chicken Tikka Masala.
This place is cool enough to be in the East Village, but French enough to make you feel like you could be in a bistro in a back alley in Paris.
Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable, makes students go back to Suan again and again.
Yes, it is good, but I've had better for cheaper.
The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini.
My girlfiends and I ate at O.G. again last night.
To finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have dessert, especially the White Chocolate Bread Pudding with Gelato and hot chocolate.
Enjoy!
The food is expensive, but worth every bite.
Half a chicken with a mountain of rice and beans for $6.25.
We will come back!!!
I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna.
The pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC.
Amma is nothing special.
The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly doesn't work.
Read all the other review, they'll confirm it.
My fiance took me to Scopa last week for my birthday and I couldn't believe the food.
It's a nice place to relax and have conversation.
Can’t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients.
Suan has challenged this loyalty.
However, I think this place is a good hang out spot.
Meal was very expensive for what you get.
This place started off a little iffy, but is now one of my favorite indian restaurants in NYC (and I'm indian, so I should know).
The specials are usually quite good too.
You should pass on the calamari.
keep up the good work.
I only have friends.
I have eaten there 3-4 times and the food was always good.
Oh right, I should probably say something nice.
NO PIZZA 33 for me!
After reading the good reviews of this restaurant, I decided to give it a try with two friends.
Its also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car (I happen to live in Inwood).
their dinner specials are fantastic.
She was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about Indian food.
The space is nice but when we order our drink we were in for a surprise.
We were very pleasantly surprised.
Great for groups, great for a date, great for early brunch or a nightcap.
If you are looking for a good quality, cheap eats - this is the place.
personally i say save your money.
The plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom(third generation-Fornini) pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle( again making it soggy) and nothingon the rest.
A defitely must visit.
For dinner I had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan.
The wine list isn't great, and the desserts are shipped in from Bruno's down the street, which is not as good as it used to be.
It is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late, raucus dinner.
What a great place!
With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering, the food here was decent, not great.
I would highly recommend.
Very nice touch that very much fits the place.
Ask for Usha, the nicest bartender in manhattan.
Furthermore, the rice had no seasoning, so the sushi was bland and disgusting.
I try my best to give an accurate description of any establishment visited.
Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else.
From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff, I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it.
I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend.
Don't go there!
The chicken lollipop is my favorite, most of the dishes (I have to agree with a previous reviewer) are quite oily and very spicy, espeically the Chilli Chicken.
Less = More in their case.
really depends on your luck!
Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store.
I have never eaten in the restaurant, however, upon reading the reviews I got take out last week.
And comparing it to the Chinatown restaurants is simply not fair.
I recommend this place to everyone who asks me where to go for a good meal.
Service was very prompt but slightly rushed.
The closest that I got was the Cherry Marscapone, but they were out of it that day.
head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st, taj mahal is also very comparable, in food quality, to the much overpraised (and underdeserving) baluchi's.
Great food.
Everything was going good until we got our meals.
...and that's saying a lot.
The food was as creative as the decor and both worked.
went there last night with my coworker.
The best part of the experience was knowing that the manager (a bubbly, friendly young woman with a great smile) truly cared about how we were doing.
The atmosphere was crowded but it was a great bistro-type vibe.
please don't fool us.
This place, however, has a lot less pretension than Joya and the Thai food is still above-average.
It has been my first choice ever since I discovered it .
I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff.
Overall the food quality was pretty good, though I hear the salmon is much better when it hasn't sat cooling in front of the guest.
If you are here as a pre-show meal, hop in a cab and take the extra 10 minutes to go to the uptown location.
The service does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but I have never been treated rudely.
While the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made Tiffin so attractive, the menu has been overhauled.
