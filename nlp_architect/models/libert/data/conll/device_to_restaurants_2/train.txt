is	O
the	O
most	O

know	O
the	O
saying	O
is	O
"	O
you	O

for	O
"	O
but	O
at	O
this	O
stage	O

my	O
recommendation	O
is	O
to	O
wait	O
on	O
buying	O
one	O
from	O
this	O

they	O
will	O
surely	O

this	O

receives	O
fairly	O

reception	B-ASP
but	O
not	O
nearly	O
as	O
good	B-OP
as	O
a	O
normal	O

as	O
long	O
as	O
the	O

are	O
coming	O
in	O
clearly	O
the	O
phone	O
's	O
radio	B-ASP
should	O
work	O
perfectly	B-OP

i	O
find	O
it	O
pretty	O
easy	B-OP
to	O
use	B-ASP
...	O
and	O
unlike	O
the	O
remote	B-ASP

(	O
on	O
the	O

another	O
irriation	B-OP

that	O
if	O
you	O

more	O

unfortunately	O
