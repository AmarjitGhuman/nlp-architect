a	O

The	O
most	O

is	O
the	O

The	O
hostess	B-ASP

rude	B-OP
to	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
being	O
offensive	B-OP
.	O

The	O
bartender	B-ASP
on	O
my	O
most	O
recent	O
visit	O
was	O
so	O
incredibly	O
rude	B-OP
that	O
I	O
will	O
never	O
go	O
back	O

the	O
hot	B-ASP
dogs	I-ASP
were	O
juicy	B-OP

inside	O

had	O
plenty	O
of	O
crunch	O
and	O
snap	O
on	O
the	O
outside	O

I	O
loved	B-OP
it	O

I	O
must	O
warn	O
the	O
reader	O
that	O
the	O
portions	B-ASP
sizes	O
are	O
very	O
small	B-OP
(	O
especially	O
the	O
appetizers	B-ASP
)	O
,	O
so	O
if	O
you	O
plan	O
to	O
eat	O
until	O
you	O

do	O
not	O
intend	O

So	O
,	O
a	O
little	O
inconsistency	O
there	O
but	O
either	O
way	O
,	O
both	O
pizzas	B-ASP

Can	O
