the	O

because	O

it	O

because	O
dim	B-ASP
sum	I-ASP

so	O
you	O
can	O

upon	O
this	O

on	O
my	O

The	O

complaint	O
is	O
the	O

I	O
believe	O
it	O

The	O

it	O
's	O
difficult	O
to	O

such	O
a	O

and	O
I	O
would	O

I	O
recommend	B-OP
this	O

The	O

is	O
a	O
little	O

think	O
the	O

The	O

and	O
the	O

the	O

bill	B-ASP
at	O
us	O
before	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
chance	O
to	O
order	O

I	O
would	O
have	O
gotten	O
some	O

and	O
a	O

Waiters	B-ASP

slow	B-OP

Only	O
suggestion	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
skip	O
the	O
dessert	B-ASP
,	O
it	O
was	O
overpriced	B-OP
and	O
fell	O

never	O
noticed	O
this	O
restaurant	O
.	O

The	O
place	O
does	O
get	O
crowded	B-OP
,	O
so	O
I	O
recommend	O
going	O
between	O
4-5	O
PM	O
.	O

My	O
Girlfriend	O
and	O
I	O
stumbled	O
onto	O
this	O
hopping	O
place	B-ASP
the	O
other	O
night	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
great	B-OP
time	I-OP
!	O

Would	O
NEVER	O
go	O
back	O

I	O
've	O
eaten	O
at	O
all	O
three	O
locations	O
and	O
I	O
always	O
love	B-OP
,	O
love	B-OP
the	O
food	B-ASP
,	O
the	O
service	B-ASP
is	O
always	O
wonderful	B-OP
and	O
the	O
prices	B-ASP
are	O
really	O
reasonable	B-OP

Warning	O
:	O
You	O
may	O
find	O
it	O
difficult	O
to	O
dine	O
at	O
other	O
Japanese	O
restaurants	O
after	O
a	O
visit	O
to	O
Mizu	O
!	O

You	O
will	O
pay	O
a	B-OP
lot	I-OP
for	O
the	O
decore	B-ASP
,	O
but	O
the	O
food	B-ASP
is	O
no	O
better	B-OP
or	O
worse	B-OP
than	O
a	B-OP
lot	I-OP
of	O
other	O
Chinese	O
and	O
Asian	O
fusion	O
places	O
in	O
NY	O
.	O

I	O
thanked	O
my	O
friend	O
who	O
recommended	B-OP
me	O
this	O
restaurant	O
and	O
will	O
certainly	O
recommend	B-OP
it	O
to	O
others	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
arrived	O
at	O
6:00	O

practically	O
empty	O

the	O

is	O
the	O
late	O
night	O
atmosphere	B-ASP
,	O
delightfully	B-OP
free	O
of	O
the	O
BTs	O
.	O

The	O
hot	B-ASP
dogs	I-ASP
are	O
good	B-OP
,	O
yes	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
reason	O
to	O

is	O
the	O
