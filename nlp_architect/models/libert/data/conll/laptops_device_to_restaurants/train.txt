Then	O
the	O

paid	O
about	O
18000	O

this	O

because	O
of	O
all	O
the	O

it	O
kept	O
crapping	O
out	O

I	O
am	O
enjoying	B-OP
it	O

the	O
quality	B-ASP

provides	O
is	O
great	B-OP

The	O

is	O
relatively	O
simple	B-OP
to	O
use	B-ASP

though	O
I	O
bought	O

which	O
is	O
well	B-OP

But	O
,	O
Mac	O
makes	O
the	O
switch	O
from	O

easy	B-OP

So	O

,	O
it	O
's	O
an	O

no	B-OP
better	I-OP

no	B-OP

I	O
replaced	O

But	O
until	O
now	O

no	O

why	O
I	O

it	O
is	O
an	O
amazing	B-OP

it	O
too	O
is	O

I	O
looked	O
at	O
the	O

it	O
said	O
updating	O

the	O
asked	O
for	O
a	O

I	O
realize	O
that	O
not	O
every	O

the	O

that	O

So	O
this	O
was	O
great	B-OP
for	O
me	O

The	O
only	O
bad	B-OP
thing	O
about	O
it	O
is	O
they	O
give	O
you	O
the	O
worst	B-OP

possible	O

Finally	O
was	O
able	O
to	O

a	O

was	O
just	O
one	O
problem	B-OP

another	O
for	O
me	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
reason	O
we	O

much	O
money	O
was	O
so	O
we	O
would	O
n't	O

anything	O

First	O
of	O
all	O
yes	O
this	O
is	O
a	O

it	O

that	O
nice	B-OP

Very	O
light	B-OP

I	O
had	O
to	O
install	B-ASP

it	O
took	O
a	O

two	O

I	O

it	O
is	O

I	O
had	O
it	O
four	O

my	O

No	O

However	O

my	O

realized	O
that	O
the	O

a	O
bit	O
loose	B-OP
(	O
when	O
you	O

the	O

This	O
is	O
my	O
first	O

had	O
very	B-OP
good	I-OP
experience	O
through	O
previous	O

Let	O
me	O
start	O
off	O
by	O
saying	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
highly	O
reluctant	B-OP
to	O
spend	O
so	O
much	O
money	O
on	O
a	O
laptop	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
suggest	O
this	O
product	O
to	O
anyone	O
.	O

I	O
've	O
had	O
it	O
for	O
about	O
2	O
months	O
now	O
and	O
found	O
no	O
issues	O
with	O
software	B-ASP
or	O
updates	B-ASP

Nightly	O
my	O
computer	O
defrags	O

runs	O

Just	O
What	O
I	O
Needed	O
For	O

My	O

Too	O
!	O

Then	O
,	O
within	O
5	O
months	O
,	O
the	O
charger	B-ASP
crapped	B-OP
out	O
on	O
me	O

I	O
've	O
owned	O
this	O

then	O
two	O
months	O
,	O
already	O
the	O
mouse	B-ASP
button	I-ASP
has	O
broke	B-OP

Also	O
the	O

are	O
not	O
very	O
loud	B-OP
,	O
But	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
netbook	O

Good	O
luck	O
with	O
your	O
purchase	O
options	O

It	O
has	O
everything	O
I	O
would	O
need	O
for	O
a	O
home	O
computer	O

I	O
do	O
not	O

From	O
the	O
build	B-ASP
quality	I-ASP
to	O
the	O
performance	B-ASP
,	O
everything	O
about	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
sub-par	B-OP
from	O
what	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
expected	O
from	O
Apple	O
.	O

The	O
computer	O
itself	O
was	O
fast	B-OP
,	O
ran	B-ASP
smoothly	B-OP
,	O
and	O
had	O
no	O
problems	O
.	O

Finally	O
decided	O
to	O
try	O
a	O
MAC	O
because	O
there	O
were	O
too	O
many	O
choices	O
of	O
which	O
PC	O
's	O
to	O
buy	O
and	O
EVERYONE	O
who	O
had	O
a	O
MAC	O
said	O
"	O
buy	O
a	O
MAC	O
"	O
.	O

The	O
only	O
downfall	B-OP
is	O
the	O
volume	B-ASP
control	I-ASP

You	O
may	O
need	O
to	O
special	O
order	O
a	O
bag	B-ASP
.	O

I	O
enjoy	O
having	O
apple	O
products	O

Though	O
please	O
note	O
that	O
sometimes	O
it	O
crashes	B-OP
,	O
and	O
the	O
sound	B-ASP
quality	I-ASP
isnt	O
superb	B-OP
.	O

Also	O
is	O
portable	B-OP
and	O
reliable	B-OP

I	O
took	O
the	O
computer	O
into	O
Best	O
Buy	O
where	O
I	O
purchased	O
it	O
and	O
they	O
kept	O
it	O
over	O
night	O
to	O

it	O

I	O
was	O
not	O
aware	O
that	O
this	O

can	O
not	O
display	O

that	O
contain	O
Flash	O

It	O
's	O
so	O
useable	B-OP
and	O
responsive	B-OP
.	O

They	O
break	B-OP
down	I-OP
just	O
as	O
often	O
as	O
PCs	O
do	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
only	O
reason	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
get	O
viruses	O
,	O
is	O
because	O
no	O
one	O
makes	O
viruses	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
're	O
not	B-OP
better	I-OP
in	O
any	O

they	O
are	O
worse	B-OP

they	O

It	O
is	O
so	O
great	B-OP
,	O
I	O
can	O
Hardly	O
ever	O
take	O
my	O

off	O
it	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
much	O
more	O
streamlined	B-OP
system	O
for	O
adding	O

using	O
the	O

doing	O
other	O

everyone	O

on	O
a	O

Well	B-OP

I	O
really	O

but	O
its	O
very	O

It	O
's	O
slow	B-OP
and	O
one	O
day	O
i	O
hope	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
money	O
to	O
get	O
rid	O
of	O
it	O
and	O
buy	O
something	O
else	O

I	O
love	B-OP
it	O
and	O
the	O
change	O
in	O

that	O
came	O
with	O
it	O

I	O
waited	O

it	O

what	O
it	O
is	O

But	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
recommend	B-OP
this	O

After	O
5	O

requested	O
a	O

it	O

The	O

I	O

I	O
've	O

I	O
really	O
do	O
love	B-OP
it	O

I	O

I	O
'm	O
finally	O
able	O

the	O

I	O

I	O
would	O

that	O
I	O

that	O

that	O
it	O

this	O

Granted	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
still	O
a	O
very	O
new	B-OP

in	O

my	O

It	O
is	O
absolutely	O

the	O

I	O

reason	O

I	O

the	O

because	O
it	O
was	O
smaller	B-OP

lighter	B-OP

Shipped	B-ASP

owing	O

I	O

I	O

there	O
went	O
another	O
two	O

I	O
am	O
pleased	B-OP

that	O
it	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
best	B-OP

I	O

I	O
would	O

Note	O
that	O
I	O

When	O

I	O
would	O
tell	O
the	O

what	O
was	O

with	O
it	O

they	O
did	O
not	O

I	O
had	O
to	O
go	O
through	O
a	O

them	O
to	O
tell	O
me	O
I	O
needed	O

I	O
needed	O
a	O
driver	B-ASP

they	O
would	O
not	O

me	O
with	O
out	O

over	O

It	O

its	O

I	O
am	O
really	O
liking	B-OP

The	O
only	O
objection	O
I	O
have	O
is	O
that	O
after	O

it	O
the	O
windows	B-ASP

a	O

So	O
far	O
so	O
good	B-OP
with	O
this	O

Also	O
,	O
it	O
hardly	B-OP
ever	I-OP
crashes	I-OP

They	O
are	O
wonderful	B-OP

but	O
very	O
dangerous	B-OP
when	O
it	O

to	O
emitting	O

Fan	B-ASP
only	O
comes	O
on	O
when	O
you	O
are	O
playing	B-ASP

It	O
s	O
heavy	B-OP

but	O
is	O
good	B-OP

Comes	O
with	O
iMovie	B-ASP

I	O
bought	O
my	O
macbook	O
a	O
few	O
months	O
ago	O
and	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
my	O
baby	O
ever	O
since	O

I	O
saved	O
about	O

After	O
replacing	O
the	O

the	O
battery	B-ASP
stopped	B-OP
working	I-OP
(	O
3	O
months	O

which	O
was	O
frustrating	B-OP

I	O
finally	O
made	O
the	O

Small	B-OP

replace	O
my	O

while	O
on	O

The	O

runs	O
very	O

They	O

They	O

by	O

the	O

Prior	O

It	O
had	O
a	O
seventeen	B-ASP

I	O
wanted	O

I	O
did	O

it	O

Another	O
THREE	O

It	O
is	O
easy	B-OP

has	O

I	O
shipped	O
out	O
on	O

Speakers	B-ASP
do	O
n't	O
get	O
that	O
loud	O

but	O
good	B-OP
enough	I-OP
.	O

I	O
constantly	O
had	O
to	O
send	O
my	O
laptop	O
in	O
for	O
services	B-ASP
every	O
3	O
months	O
and	O
it	O
always	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
same	O
problem	B-OP
that	O
they	O
said	O
they	O
had	O
already	O
fixed	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
made	O
better	B-OP
,	O
thicker	B-OP
,	O
and	O
all	O
out	O
tough	O
!	O

I	O
am	O
now	O
making	O
a	O
point	O
to	O
avoid	O
their	O
products	O
and	O
I	O
hope	O
my	O
experience	O
can	O
serve	O
as	O
a	O
warning	O
to	O
you	O
as	O
well	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
computer	O
has	O
been	O
on	O
for	O
several	O
minutes	O
,	O
it	O
will	O
occasionaly	O
just	O
go	O
off	O
by	O
itself	O
.	O

I	O
bought	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
dedicate	O
a	O
small	B-OP
,	O
portable	B-OP
laptop	O
to	O
my	O
writing	O
and	O
was	O
surprised	B-OP
to	O
learn	O
that	O
I	O
needed	O
to	O
buy	O
a	O
word	B-ASP
processing	I-ASP
program	I-ASP
to	O
do	O
so	O
.	O

The	O
keyboard	B-ASP
is	O
top	B-OP

Processor	B-ASP
-	O
When	O
compared	O
to	O
my	O
3	O
week	O
old	O
Early	O
2011	O
edition	O
there	O
I	O
barely	O
experience	O
any	O
difference	O
in	O
performance	B-ASP
(	O
2.3	O
GHz	O
v/s	O
2.4	O
GHz	O
)	O
.	O

So	O
i	O
would	O
not	B-OP
reccomend	I-OP
anyone	O
buying	O
this	O
computer	O

Two	O
times	O
with	O
in	O
one	O
month	O
.	O

This	O
system	O
is	O
not	B-OP
worth	I-OP
the	O
money	O
or	O
trouble	O
trying	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
fix	O
.	O

Not	O
to	O
mention	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
your	O
mac	O
comes	O
fully	B-OP
loaded	I-OP
with	O
all	O
necessary	B-OP
basic	O
programs	B-ASP
.	O

Again	O
.	O

The	O
biggest	O
problem	B-OP
is	O
that	O
the	O
box	O
had	O
no	B-OP
instructions	B-ASP
in	O
it	O
.	O

This	O
can	O
be	O
annoying	O
at	O
first	O
but	O
you	O
just	O
have	O
to	O
train	O
yourself	O
not	O
to	O
to	O
start	O
over	O
so	O
far	O
.	O

The	O
bottom-line	O
is	O
that	O
this	O
laptop	O
just	O
is	O
n't	O
worth	B-OP
it	O
.	O

The	O
acer	O
one	O
compuer	O
is	O
a	O
great	B-OP
computer	O

I	O
'm	O
so	O
glad	B-OP
I	O
purchased	O
a	O
Mac	O
and	O
not	O
another	O
PC	O
!!!	O

it	O
's	O
just	O
a	O
great	B-OP
toy	O
to	O
have	O
around	O

Since	O
I	O
purchased	O
my	O
Toshiba	O
netbook	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
very	O
pleased	B-OP
with	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
a	O
laptob	O
and	O
a	O
desktop	O

The	O
computer	O
is	O
so	O
slow	B-OP

even	O
after	O
paying	O
staples	O
the	O
extra	O
money	O
to	O
speed	O
it	O
up	O

its	O
as	O
advertised	O
on	O
here	O
....	O
.	O
it	O
works	B-ASP
great	B-OP
and	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
waste	O
of	O
money	O
!	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
find	O
a	O
phone	O
number	O
anywhere	O
to	O
call	O
an	O
actual	O
live	O
person	O
for	O
tech	B-ASP

had	O
to	O
result	O
the	O
their	O

The	O
Toshiba	O
Satellite	O
has	O
been	O
more	B-OP
than	I-OP
I	I-OP
expected	I-OP
for	O
the	O
price	B-ASP
.	O

Sadly	O
Apple	O
has	O
discontinued	O
this	O
MacBook	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
never	O
super	O
popular	O
since	O
it	O
fell	O
somewhere	O
in	O
between	O
the	O
cheapest	O
white	O
model	O
and	O
the	O
smaller	O
Pros	O
.	O

Ok	O
,	O
this	O
is	O
probably	O
the	O
best	B-OP
laptop	O
series	O
ever	O
devised	O
by	O
Apple	O
.	O

I	O
bought	O
it	O
from	O
HSN	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
"	O
bundled	O
"	O
with	O
extra	O
software	B-ASP
,	O
but	O
as	O
it	O
turns	O
out	O
,	O
that	O
software	B-ASP
just	O
crashes	B-OP
it	O
more	O
often	O
.....	O

(	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
Windows/Linux	O
user	O
before	O
this	O
)	O
I	O
love	B-OP
the	O
size	B-ASP
because	O
the	O
screen	B-ASP
is	O
big	B-OP
enough	O
for	O
what	O
I	O
use	O
it	O
for	O
(	O
Internet	O
,	O
artwork	O
)	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
it	O
is	O
small	B-OP
enough	O
to	O
be	O
reasonably	O
portable	B-OP
.	O

People	O
know	O
what	O
they	O
are	O
talking	O
about	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
pride	O
in	O
the	O
product	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
selling	O
.	O

If	O
you	O
have	O
much	O
higher	O
expectations	O
than	O
that	O
...	O
I	O
would	O
look	O
elsewhere	O

When	O
i	O
finally	O
held	O
it	O
in	O
my	O

i	O
kissed	O
it	O

i	O
did	O

Well	O
,	O
I	O
started	O
using	O
Google	B-ASP

which	O
is	O
a	O

I	O

it	O

no	O

nothing	O

i	O
've	O
been	O

about	O
six	O

again	O
it	O

this	O
