We	O

out	O

in	O
my	O
opinion	O

Every	O

was	O
better	B-OP

the	O
next	O

The	O
food	B-ASP

We	O

It	O
may	O

the	O

The	O

claimed	O
that	O

an	O

What	O
really	O
makes	O
it	O

the	O

even	O
the	O

Admittedly	O

this	O

the	O

(	O
and	O
thank	O

for	O

no	O

in	O
New	O

or	O
anywhere	O
in	O
the	O
US	O

This	O
place	O
is	O
worth	B-OP
going	O
even	O
if	O
only	O
for	O
their	O
beer	B-ASP

However	O
,	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
understand	O
the	O
extraordinary	O
hype	O
about	O
this	O
restaurant	O

Only	O
wine	B-ASP

beer	B-ASP
are	O
served	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
house	B-ASP
varities	I-ASP
are	O
actually	O
quite	O
good	B-OP

The	O
only	O
thing	O
I	O
moderately	O
enjoyed	B-OP
was	O
their	O
Grilled	B-ASP
Chicken	I-ASP
special	I-ASP
with	I-ASP
Edamame	I-ASP
Puree	I-ASP
.	O

The	O
most	O
annoying	B-OP
thing	O
,	O
though	O
,	O
is	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
servers	B-ASP
seem	O
to	O
be	O
trained	O
to	O
drive	O
revenue	O
.	O

The	O
restaurant	O
is	O
a	O
bit	O
noisy	B-OP
but	O
that	O
is	O
something	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
overlooked	B-OP
once	O
you	O
sit	O
down	O
and	O
enjoy	B-OP
a	O
great	B-OP
meal	B-ASP

Oh	O
,	O
but	O
wait	O

we	O
were	O
out	O
of	O

which	O
were	O
also	O
delightfully	O

They	O
are	O
by	O

the	O
BEST	B-OP
