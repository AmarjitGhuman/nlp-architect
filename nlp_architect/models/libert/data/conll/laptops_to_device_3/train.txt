The	O

wears	O

to	O
the	O

'	O
ts	O
nice	B-OP

the	O

the	O

This	O

makes	O
the	O

Then	O
the	O

I	O

Well	O

I	O

After	O
fumbling	O
around	O
with	O
the	O
OS	B-ASP
I	O
started	O
searching	O
the	O

for	O
a	O
fix	O
and	O
found	O
a	O
number	O
of	O

the	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
no	B-OP
luck	I-OP
with	O
staples	O
or	O
HP	O
to	O
resolve	O
this	O
problem	O

I	O
'm	O
glad	B-OP
I	O
bought	O
this	O
laptop	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
worth	B-OP
the	O
few	O
(	O
$	O
100	O
)	O
extra	O
dollars	O
.	O

so	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
computer	O
does	O
not	O
work	B-ASP
on	O
the	O
24	O
twenty	O
fourth	O
day	O
is	O
my	O
fault	O

Unfortunately	O
,	O
Apple	O
's	O
quality	B-ASP
has	O
continued	O
to	O
slide	B-OP

A	O
longer	B-OP
battery	B-ASP
life	I-ASP
would	O
have	O
been	O
great	B-OP
-	O
but	O
it	O
meets	O
it	O
's	O
spec	B-ASP
quite	O
easily	B-OP
.	O

The	O
battery	B-ASP
does	O
n't	O
last	O
long	B-OP
but	O
I	O
'm	O
sure	O
an	O
upgrade	O
battery	B-ASP
would	O
solve	O
that	O
problem	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
SO	O
much	O
fun	B-OP
to	O
play	O
with	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
very	O
annoying	B-OP
.	O

Also	O
,	O
the	O
space	B-ASP
bar	I-ASP
makes	O
a	O
noisy	B-OP
click	O
every	O
time	O
you	O
use	O
it	O

The	O
display	B-ASP
is	O
beyond	O
horrible	B-OP

So	O
this	O
review	O

a	O

bit	O

I	O

So	O
then	O
you	O
may	O
be	O
lucky	O
to	O
get	O
ahold	O
to	O
someone	O
who	O
understands	O
that	O
its	O
no	O
good	O
and	O
they	O
will	O
let	O
you	O
send	O
it	O
back	O
,	O
but	O
of	O

you	O
are	O
taking	O
a	O
chance	O
of	O
them	O
testing	O
it	O
out	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
has	O

and	O
they	O
tell	O
you	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
on	O
their	O
side	O
,	O
then	O
you	O
are	O
stuck	O

They	O

Learning	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
keyboard	B-ASP
shortcuts	I-ASP
only	O
took	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
to	O

I	O
managed	O
to	O

I	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
worry	O
at	O
first	O

I	O
do	O

have	O
a	O

with	O
os.x	B-ASP

been	O
second	O
nature	O
to	O
me	O
after	O
many	O
years	O
of	O
using	O
windows	B-ASP

The	O
biggest	O
problem	B-OP
is	O
that	O
the	O
box	O
had	O
no	B-OP
instructions	B-ASP
in	O
it	O
.	O

Better	O
stick	O
with	O
another	O
brand	O

I	O
made	O
a	O
perfect	B-OP
decision	O
when	O
I	O
bought	O
the	O
Toshiba	O

I	O
can	O
hardly	O
wait	O
to	O

whats	O
around	O
the	O
next	O

But	O
for	O
now	O
,	O
this	O

is	O
still	O
a	O
workhorse	O

This	O
computer	O
does	O
n't	B-OP
do	I-OP
that	I-OP
well	I-OP
with	O
certain	O
games	B-ASP
it	O
ca	O
n't	O
play	O
some	O
and	O
it	O
becomes	O
too	O
hot	B-OP
while	O
playing	O
games	O
.	O

lots	B-OP
of	O
extra	O
space	B-ASP
but	O
the	O
keyboard	B-ASP
is	O
ridiculously	O
small	B-OP
.	O

Searched	O
it	O
on	O
amazon	O
and	O
on	O
bestbuy	O
.	O

It	O
really	O
is	O
very	O
light	B-OP
compared	O
to	O
other	O
computers	O
.	O

There	O
is	O
no	O
cd	B-ASP
drive	I-ASP
on	O
the	O
computer	O
,	O
which	O
defeats	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	O
keeping	O
files	O
on	O
a	O
cd	O
.	O

To	O
my	O
mind	O
much	O
more	O
usable	O
than	O
the	O
toy	O
called	O
an	O
IPad	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
fast	B-OP
and	O
easy	B-OP
to	O
use	B-ASP
.	O

I	O
wanted	O
something	O
that	O
had	O
a	O
new	B-OP
Intel	B-ASP
Core	I-ASP
processors	I-ASP
and	O
HDMI	B-ASP
port	I-ASP
so	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
hook	O
it	O
up	O
directly	O
to	O
our	O
TV	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
simpler	B-OP
to	O
use	B-ASP
.	O

I	O
like	B-OP
the	O
brightness	B-ASP
and	O
adjustments	B-ASP
.	O

In	O
my	O
line	O
of	O
work	O
,	O
I	O
often	O
have	O
to	O
take	O
work	O
home	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
makes	O
it	O
so	O
easy	B-OP
.	O

First	O
of	O
all	O
yes	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
mac	O
and	O
it	O
has	O
that	O
nice	B-OP
brushed	O

Oh	O
my	O
goodness-I	O
am	O
not	O
a	O
happy	O

And	O
I	O
may	O
be	O
the	O
only	O
one	O
but	O
I	O
am	O
really	O
liking	B-OP
Windows	B-ASP
8	I-ASP
.	O

Speakers	B-ASP
does	O
n't	B-OP
sound	I-OP
that	I-OP
great	I-OP

I	O
switched	O
to	O
this	O
because	O
I	O
wanted	O
something	O
different	O
,	O
even	O
though	O
I	O
miss	O
windows	B-ASP

This	O
computer	O
is	O
absolutely	O
AMAZING	B-OP
!!!	O

Good	O
luck	O
.	O

The	O
Mini	O
's	O
body	B-ASP
has	O
n't	O
changed	O
since	O
late	O
2010	O
-	O
and	O
for	O
a	O
good	B-OP
reason	O
.	O

Then	O
to	O
make	O
matters	O
worst	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
noone	O
that	O
they	O
can	O
transfer	O
you	O
to	O

Winters	O
is	O
on	O
it	O

I	O
imagine	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
cozy	O

The	O
speed	B-ASP
difference	O
is	O
next	O
to	O
NOTHING	O
for	O
a	O
mac	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
hard	B-ASP
drive	I-ASP
can	O
be	O
manually	O
upgraded	B-OP
or	O
you	O
could	O
just	O
buy	O
a	O
$	O
60	O
500gb	B-ASP
external	I-ASP
hard	I-ASP
drive	I-ASP
.	O

But	O
the	O
biggest	O
pain	B-OP
is	O
that	O
tech	B-ASP
support	I-ASP
is	O
not	O
available	O
24/7	O
.	O

I	O
am	O
not	O
sure	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
drive	B-ASP
itself	O
,	O
however	O
;	O

BTW	O
,	O
I	O
checked	O
online	O

the	O
old	O

found	O
that	O
I	O

far	O
from	O
it	O

So	O
far	O
,	O
a	O
great	B-OP
product	O
.	O

The	O
only	O
bad	B-OP
thing	O
about	O
it	O
is	O
they	O
give	O
you	O
the	O
worst	B-OP
batteries	B-ASP
possible	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
absolutely	O
wonderful	B-OP
and	O
worth	B-OP
the	O
price	B-ASP

This	O
is	O
no	O
exception	O

only	O
good	B-OP
thing	O
is	O
the	O

that	O

it	O

slow	B-OP

but	O
now	O
i	O
have	O
realized	O
its	O
a	O
problem	B-OP
with	O
this	O

So	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
years	O
later	O

I	O
was	O
a	O

On	O

it	O
asks	O

just	O
so	O
itune	B-ASP
can	O
sell	O
you	O
more	O
of	O
their	O

I	O
would	O
say	O
that	O
85	O
%	O
of	O
the	O

is	O
Mac	O
for	O
good	O
reason	O

My	O
MacBook	O
is	O
faster	B-OP

any	O

I	O
would	O

because	O
the	O

I	O
did	O

three	O

four	O

it	O

It	O
's	O

I	O
'm	O
Not	O
exagerating	O
when	O
I	O
say	O
this	O

i	O
It	O
is	O
!!	O

I	O
'm	O
so	O
disgusted	B-OP
that	O
I	O
wasted	B-OP
my	O
money	O
on	O
this	O
product	O

It	O
works	B-ASP
fine	B-OP
,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
software	B-ASP
seems	O
to	O
run	O
pretty	O
well	B-OP

It	O
is	O
the	O
best	B-OP
laptop	O
ever	O
!!!	O

The	O
battery	B-ASP
life	I-ASP
is	O
great	B-OP

Garageband	B-ASP
is	O
easy	B-OP
to	O
work	O
with	O
,	O
like	O
all	O
the	O
other	O
apple	B-ASP
applications	I-ASP
I	O
've	O
had	O
experience	O
with	O

The	O
only	O
downfall	B-OP
is	O
the	O
volume	B-ASP

Oh	O
,	O
boy	O
!	O

wow	O
the	O
new	O
macbook	O
pro	O
hanged	O
as	O
i	O
tried	O
to	O
type	O
this	O
review	O
.	O

The	O
processor	B-ASP
screams	B-OP
,	O
and	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
unique	B-OP
way	O
that	O
Apple	O
OSX	B-ASP
16	I-ASP
functions	O
,	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
graphics	B-ASP
are	O
routed	O
through	O
the	O
hardware	B-ASP
rather	O
than	O
the	O
software	B-ASP
.	O

So	O
I	O
'm	O
disappointed	B-OP
in	O
that	O
because	O
communicating	O
with	O
my	O
relatives	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
area	O
is	O
a	O
priority	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
disappointed	B-OP
when	O
I	O
realized	O
that	O
the	O
keyboard	B-ASP
does	O
n't	B-OP
light	I-OP
up	I-OP
on	O
this	O
model	O
.	O

The	O
ease	O
in	O
which	O
you	O
set	O
everything	O
up	O
is	O
such	O
that	O
a	O
child	O
could	O
do	O
it	O
.	O

So	O
we	O
exchanged	O
it	O
for	O
the	O
same	O
on	O
and	O
after	O
2	O
hours	O
it	O
did	O
n't	O
work	B-ASP
.	O

Runs	B-ASP
smooth	B-OP
and	O
quick	B-OP
.	O

I	O
tried	O
to	O
upgrade	O
it	O
to	O
a	O
newer	O
version	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
months	O
ago	O
and	O
I	O
still	O
have	O
the	O
same	O
problem	O
.	O

The	O
love	B-OP
part	O
of	O
my	O
relationship	O
with	O
this	O
laptop	O
does	O
n't	B-OP
take	I-OP
very	I-OP
long	I-OP
.	O

so	O
in	O
a	O
brief	O
summary	O
i	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
i	O
would	O
not	B-OP
recommend	I-OP
dell	O
vostro	O
1000	O
to	O
anyone	O
due	O
to	O
it	O
being	O
a	O
down	O
right	O
awful	B-OP
setup	B-ASP
so	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
you	O
should	O
steer	O
clear	O
of	O
them	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
a	O
decent	O
laptop	O
.	O

I	O
love	B-OP
the	O
dock	B-ASP
where	O
I	O
can	O
simply	O
drop	O
a	O
file	O
ontop	O
of	O
a	O
particular	O
program	B-ASP
,	O
and	O
the	O
program	B-ASP
will	O
simply	O
open	O
that	O
file	O
.	O

The	O
iLife	B-ASP
software	I-ASP
that	O
comes	O
with	O
the	O
computer	O
is	O
so	O
simple	B-OP
to	O
use	B-ASP
and	O
produces	O
a	O
great	B-OP
finished	O
product	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
after	O
Apple	O
replaced	O
the	O
hard	B-ASP
drive	I-ASP
I	O
enjoyed	O
another	O
4	O
months	O
of	O
my	O
new	O
computer	O
,	O
until	O
it	O
froze	B-OP
this	O
morning	O
--	O
completely	O

I	O
took	O
it	O
back	O
to	O
the	O

exchanged	O
it	O
for	O
another	O
one	O
.	O

Keyboard	B-ASP

The	O

the	O

the	O

It	O

I	O

after	O

it	O
cost	O
around	O
eighty	O

it	O

out	O

that	O

that	O
I	O

About	O
2	O

i	O
bought	O
the	O
2011	O

which	O
was	O
an	O
upgrade	O
from	O
my	O

oh	O
yeah	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
the	O

breaks	O
guess	O
who	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
send	O
it	O
to	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
fixed	O
?	O

If	O
you	O
have	O
the	O
money	O
I	O
suggest	B-OP
going	O
for	O
the	O
i7	O
.	O

Did	O
not	O
enjoy	B-OP
the	O
new	O
Windows	B-ASP
8	I-ASP
and	O
touchscreen	B-ASP
functions	I-ASP

I	O
spent	O
months	O
looking	O
for	O
a	O
good	B-OP
laptop	O
for	O
me	O
and	O
I	O
finally	O
found	O
it	O
!	O

I	O
previously	O
owned	O
a	O
Toshiba	O

it	O
only	O
lasted	O
about	O
2	O

Boot-up	B-ASP
slowed	B-OP
significantly	I-OP
after	O
all	O

were	O
installed	O

Instead	O
of	O
taking	O
another	O
chance	O
on	O
Toshiba	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
with	O
an	O
Asus	O
G73JH-x3	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
buy	O
today	O
and	O
noticed	O
it	O
went	O
back	O
up	O
to	O
$	O
344.99	O

I	O
did	O
n't	O
want	O

it	O
is	O
really	O

Excellent	B-OP

After	O
about	O
a	O

I	O
finally	O
got	O
it	O
back	O
and	O
was	O
told	O
that	O
the	O

so	O
they	O
installed	O
a	O

The	O
