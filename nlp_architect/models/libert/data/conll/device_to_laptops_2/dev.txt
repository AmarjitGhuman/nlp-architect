in	O

to	O

in	O
my	O
opinion	O
you	O
should	O
steer	O

if	O
you	O
want	O
a	O

All	O
I	O
can	O

I	O

Dismantle	O
the	O

Then	O
it	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
a	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
can	O
refute	O
that	O
OSX	B-ASP

FAST	B-OP

Not	O
to	O
mention	O
sometimes	O
the	O

It	O

this	O

I	O

that	O

Was	O
very	O

the	O

paid	O

Overall	O
I	O
feel	O
this	O
netbook	O
was	O
poor	B-OP
quality	B-ASP

had	O
poor	B-OP

that	O
it	O
is	O
n't	O
$	O
1400	O

Biggest	O
complaint	B-OP
is	O
Windows	B-ASP

Hieroglyphics	O

I	O
would	O

one	O

be	O
careful	O

I	O

Oh	O

if	O

not	O
bad	B-OP
enough	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
come	O

you	O

to	O
me	O
that	O

which	O
is	O

this	O

the	O

The	O

I	O

what	O
the	O

all	O
about	O

Beta	O
had	O
better	B-OP

became	O
the	O
industry	O

was	O
debating	O
to	O
buy	O
one	O

checked	O

Eventually	O
the	O

the	O

Now	O
I	O
could	O

The	O
first	O

I	O
used	O
the	O

it	O
took	O
half	O

a	O

to	O
remove	B-ASP
the	I-ASP

The	O

was	O
a	O
good	B-OP

It	O
's	O
so	O

to	O
navigate	O
through	O
the	O

This	O

Eventually	O
my	O

As	O
I	O
soon	O
discovered	O

though	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
reason	O
for	O
which	O
similarly-configured	O
Sony	O

Toshiba	O

cost	O
more	O

they	O
use	O
higher-quality	B-OP

I	O
had	O

a	O

took	O
it	O
to	O
their	O

find	O
out	O
what	O
the	O

was	O

the	O
last	O

we	O
took	O
it	O
to	O
get	O
fixed	O
the	O

that	O
most	O
likely	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
reppative	O

will	O
keep	O

we	O

Before	O

The	O

NO	O

I	O
paid	O
about	O
18000	O

because	O

its	O
not	O
