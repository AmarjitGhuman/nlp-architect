The	O

thing	O
about	O
this	O

is	O
the	O
price	B-ASP
along	O
with	O
some	O
of	O
the	O

Looked	O

a	O
bunch	O
of	O

I	O
really	O

The	O
improvements	O
to	O
the	O
OS	B-ASP
have	I-ASP
been	I-ASP
relatively	I-ASP

substantive	I-ASP

It	O
is	O
very	O
easy	B-OP
to	O
integrate	B-ASP
bluetooth	I-ASP
devices	I-ASP

and	O
USB	B-ASP
devices	I-ASP
are	O
recognized	O
almost	O
instantly	B-OP

The	O
rep	B-ASP
did	O
not	O
even	O
answer	O
my	O

I	O
had	O
to	O
ask	O
him	O

if	O
he	O
understood	O
what	O
I	O
ask	O
or	O
if	O
he	O
spoke	O

because	O
he	O
did	O
n't	O
even	O

my	O

I	O
went	O
right	O
out	O

purchased	O
another	O

So	O
think	O
about	O
factoring	O
those	O
things	O
in	O
when	O
you	O
purchase	O

So	O
far	O
,	O
a	O
great	B-OP

I	O
was	O
really	O
happy	B-OP

it	O

it	O
was	O
in	O
the	O

I	O
've	O
tried	O

All	O

I	O
have	O
never	O

an	O

this	O

Very	O
satisfied	B-OP

The	O
pricing	B-ASP
is	O
very	O
competitive	B-OP

I	O
had	O
3	O
months	O
when	O
the	O

started	O
going	O
out	O

Do	O
I	O

?	O
Well	O
,	O
other	O
than	O
not	O
getting	O

I	O

I	O
love	B-OP

It	O
works	B-ASP

persoal	O
or	O
just	O

so	O
built	B-ASP
in	I-ASP

is	O
not	O
terribly	O
important	O

The	O
keyboard	B-ASP
is	O
slick	B-OP

quiet	B-OP
and	O
not	B-OP
bulky	I-OP
like	O
some	O

I	O

in	O
the	O

I	O
like	B-OP
the	O

I	O
needed	O
a	O
laptop	O
with	O
big	B-OP

and	O
I	O
ca	O
n't	O
believe	O
Apple	O
keeps	O
making	O
the	O
same	O
mistake	O
with	O
regard	O
to	O
USB	B-ASP
ports	I-ASP

I	O
have	O

I	O
like	B-OP
the	O

on	O
it	O

falls	O
into	O
the	O
case	O

I	O
paid	O
about	O

it	O
kept	O
crapping	O
out	O

One	O
suggestion	O
I	O
do	O
have	O
,	O
is	O
to	O
not	O
bother	O
getting	O
Microsoft	B-ASP
office	I-ASP
for	I-ASP
the	I-ASP
mac	I-ASP
expecting	O
it	O
will	O

you	O
knew	O
it	O
to	O
on	O
a	O

However	O
I	O
dealt	O

more	O

If	O

a	O
dell	O

50	O

when	O
I	O
use	O

Within	O

But	O
the	O

everything	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
I	O
can	O

is	O
that	O
Sony	O

I	O

After	O
replacing	O
the	O

the	O
battery	B-ASP
stopped	B-OP
working	I-OP
(	O
3	O
months	O

was	O
