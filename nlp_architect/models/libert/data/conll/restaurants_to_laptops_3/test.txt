that	O

If	O
that	O

the	O
case	O

then	O
I	O
am	O
completely	O
happy	B-OP

I	O
complain	O
again	O

I	O
look	O
forward	O
to	O
years	O
of	O
use	O
,	O
it	O
has	O
held	O
up	O
well	B-OP
over	O
the	O
years	O
and	O
it	O
fits	O
my	O
needs	O
very	O
well	B-OP

My	O
computer	O
froze	B-OP
on	O
several	O
occasion	O
,	O
had	O
buttons	B-ASP
that	O
randomely	O
would	O
fall	B-OP
off	I-OP
and	O
even	O
had	O
moments	O
when	O
the	O
computer	O
would	O
refuse	O
to	O
turn	O
on	O
at	O
all	O
.	O

After	O
5	O
months	O
of	O
failed	O
repairs	O
,	O
requested	O
a	O
full	O
refund	O
but	O
was	O
refused	O
and	O
it	O
still	O
is	O
not	O
repaired	O
and	O
Acer	O
is	O
indifferent	O
to	O
the	O
issue	O

This	O
computer	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
has	O
had	O
issues	O
with	O
the	O

where	O
it	O
lost	B-OP
half	O

At	O
first	O
when	O
I	O
got	O
this	O

I	O
loved	B-OP
it	O

It	O
provides	O
much	O
more	B-OP
flexibility	B-ASP
for	I-ASP

So	O
,	O
if	O
you	O
're	O

I	O
would	O
heartily	O

I	O

it	O
was	O
