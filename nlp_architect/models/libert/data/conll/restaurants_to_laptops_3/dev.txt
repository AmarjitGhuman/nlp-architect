of	O
work	O
,	O
I	O
often	O
have	O
to	O
take	O
work	O
home	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
makes	O
it	O
so	O
easy	B-OP
.	O

As	O
well	O
as	O
having	O
the	O
plug	B-ASP
in	O
the	O
computer	O
come	O
loose	B-OP
.	O

You	O
will	O
fall	O
in	O
love	B-OP
with	O
it	O
in	O
no	O
time	O
.	O

even	O
though	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
receipt	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
me	O
proving	O
it	O
still	O
had	O
2	O
months	O
left	O
on	O
the	O
warranty	B-ASP
.	O

I	O
homeschool	O
my	O
kids	O
and	O
with	O
this	O
netbook	O
next	O
to	O
my	O
desk	O
we	O
get	O
to	O
teaching	O
and	O
illustrating	O
without	O
skipping	O
a	O
beat	O
.	O

After	O
about	O
another	O
month	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
send	O
it	O
in	O
AGAIN	O
to	O
Acer	O
for	O
repairs	O
.	O

I	O
'm	O
tired	B-OP
of	I-OP
the	O
inept	O
service	B-ASP
.	O

It	O
is	O
very	O
user	B-OP
friendly	I-OP
and	O
not	O
hard	B-OP
to	O
figure	O
out	O
at	O
all	O
.	O

The	O
price	B-ASP
is	O
great	B-OP
for	O
this	O
model	O
,	O
I	O
only	O
plan	O
on	O
using	O
it	O
for	O
media	O
in	O
the	O
entertainment	O
room	O
.	O

Then	O
the	O
system	B-ASP
would	O
many	O
times	O
not	O
power	B-ASP
down	I-ASP
without	O
a	O
forced	O
power-off	O
.	O

I	O
bought	O
it	O
from	O
HSN	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
"	O
bundled	O
"	O
with	O
extra	O
software	B-ASP
,	O
but	O
as	O
it	O
turns	O
out	O
,	O
that	O
software	B-ASP
just	O
crashes	B-OP
it	O
more	O
often	O
.....	O

But	O
,	O
like	O
I	O
said	O
before	O
,	O
the	O
only	O
reason	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
currently	O
have	O
a	O
Mac	O
laptop	O
is	O
because	O
all	O
of	O
their	O
laptops	O
are	O
too	O
pricey	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
why	O
I	O
purchased	O
a	O
BRAND	O
NEW	O
LAPTOP	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
place	O
so	O
it	O
would	O
n't	O
have	O
ANY	O
problems	O
.	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
I	O
would	O
change	B-OP
about	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
mouse	B-ASP
keys	I-ASP
.	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O
use	O
my	O
laptop	O
in	O
a	O
way	O
though	O
that	O
needs	O
a	O
long	B-OP
battery	B-ASP
life	I-ASP
so	O
it	O
's	O
perfect	B-OP
for	O
me	O
.	O

Because	O
he	O
said	O
that	O
the	O
hinge	B-ASP
is	O
under	O
the	O
motherboard	B-ASP
and	O
they	O
have	O
to	O
dismantle	O
the	O
whole	O
thing	O
before	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
tightened	O
.	O

What	O
a	O
waste	O
of	O
time	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
run	O
a	O
Defrag	O
on	O
the	O
PC	O

All	O
the	O
above	O

this	O

The	O
Unibody	B-ASP
construction	I-ASP
is	O
solid	B-OP

sleek	B-OP

beautiful	B-OP

Unfortunately	O
,	O
Apple	O
's	O
quality	B-ASP
has	O
continued	O
to	O
slide	B-OP

It	O
is	O
easy	B-OP
to	O
use	O
,	O
good	B-OP
quality	B-ASP
and	O
good	B-OP
price	B-ASP

The	O
keyboard	B-ASP

which	O
generally	O
felt	O
okay	B-OP
even	O
for	O
someone	O
used	O
to	O
a	O
desktop	B-ASP
keyboard	I-ASP

now	O
looks	O

I	O
looked	O
at	O

it	O

the	O

I	O
have	O

almost	O
four	O

and	O
I	O
have	O
only	O
had	O

three	O
years	O

this	O

make	O
it	O

The	O
sound	B-ASP
is	O
a	O
bit	O
quiet	B-OP
if	O
you	O
're	O
on	O
a	O

this	O
