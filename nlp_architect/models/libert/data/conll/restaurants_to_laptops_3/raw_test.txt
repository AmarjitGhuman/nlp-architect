In November my computer messed up entirely and wouldn't power on after intalling a Windows update, I had to have my HD flashed and lost EVERYTHING on it, including my school assignments and irriplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things, when this update was installed for some reason I was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installed it deleted my history.
the programs are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like a charm.
The AC power port becomes loose over time
There is a blank lighted screen when I start and that is all.
(3DMARK6 score is only 8500).
And it is impossible to get them back in.
I've been having endless problems since I bought the computer - only 1 month ago
SO of course this one came through with the awesomeness!
The advantages of owning 'a 'mac are numerous.
When I turned it on, nothing.
Easy to customize setting and even create your own bookmarks.
It is pretty snappy and starts up in about 30 seconds which is good enough for me.
Three, the mac book has advantages over pcs' with linux based os there is very 'few problems with system performance when it comes to a mac.
little short on RAM but you get what you pay for.
Maximum sound isn't nearly as loud as it should be.
After using it for over a month, an issue started to surface.
Other than that I don't have one complaint in the world!
  They ended up keeping my computer for almost 3 months!
It is so much easier to use
That whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $175 and it was fixed.
It's a joke.
Other ports include FireWire 800, Gigabit Ethernet, MagSafe port, Microphone jack.
  Before we got this laptop, had a compaq pasaro for 5 years with no problems.
It is easy to find documents, and keep them in one area.
You know, using the computer should be fun, not aggrevation, especially when you are playing games or working with photos.
It took several weeks just to get them to acknowledge that I owned the warranty.
Moving from a PC to Mac has never been easier, and I'm glad that I did it.
I have Vista, so I am unable to install and uninstall  some programs.
Oh yea, has no numeric pad on the side.
I took it back for a full refund.
But the Macbook is the best!
Being a PC user for many years to switch to a Mac I will not go back.
There are no viruses or spyware to worry about like on a Windows computer.
It s heavy for Mac book but is good.
As an owner of a Toshiba Satalite laptop computer things you should know before you buy.
both upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary Product Key.
It's a great prodcut to handle basic computing needs.
Toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done.
The 13" MacBook Pro is portable, durable, and very capable.
I can render AVCHD movies with little effort, which was a problem for most pc's unless you had a quad core I7.
Sells for the same as a netbook without sacrificing size.
Your cursor will end up all over the freaking place,,,it's not uncommon for me to accidentally delete words, sentences, paragraphs because of this mousepad.
It turned out it's not really a problem to have a Mac.
I told them that I just received my brand new MacBook but I was having issues.
  The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely.
To those thinking about switching, do it and do not look back!
I bought for my son in the 2nd grade.
I've had to call Apple support to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful, english speaking (from Vancouver) techs that walked me through the processes to help me.
In the first moth of owning this computer its hardrive failed which had to be replaced.
Minis make sense for a lot of people.
I am just amazed.
The letter A stopped working after the first week.
So glad I decided to upgrade!
the latest version does not have a disc drive.
The online tutorial videos make it super easy to learn if you have always used a PC.
Hieroglyphics are quite common.
Apparently they're not special anymore .
My kids (and dogs) destroyed two power cords by pulling on them.
It is meant to be PORTABLE.
it is of high quality, has a killer GUI, is extremely stable, is highly expandable, is bundled with lots of very good applications, is easy to use, and is absolutely gorgeous.
I did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements, but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before I purchased.
Yes, they cost more, but they more than make up for it in speed, construction quality, and longevity.
I currently own a Lenovo laptop as well as my new MacBook Pro, and each have their own strengths and weaknesses.
I haven't used the product long enough to write a detailed technical review.
I use this for my tutoring business, and since I'm always bouncing from student to student, it is ideal for portability and battery life (yes, it gets the 8 hours as advertised!).
When we bought our new HP comouter in Dec. of 2008, we wanted Windows XP, but were told it would cost an extra $159, so we went with Vista.
My Mac is much more efficient than a PC so it does not need the extra bells and whistles to compete.
I only used it to browse the internet and and I dont know how many times it has spontaniously shut down and it is just a blank screen now.
I saw the Mini Mac at Best Buy and decided to get this as my replacement.
I'm glad I bought this laptop, it was worth the few ($100) extra dollars.
I wanted to spend around $700 to $800 so I was directed to a nice looking HP Laptop.
Then to make matters worst, there is noone that they can transfer you to.
I'm just really happy that I waited to buy, because this thing kicks a$$!
On two occasions the computer s calendar told me it was 1969.
I am very happy with my first Mac.
I took it back to Best Buy where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a new one.
The only problems are the sound isnt very loud I have to wear headphones.
About 1/2 of the sites I need to visit because of my work contain some type of Flash.
I work on a PC at home and have used Pc all through college.
Now,,,,,my monitor has been acting up for about 2 months.
I re-seated the "WLAN" card inside and re-installed the LAN device drivers.
I also had a problem with the touchpad that caused the mouse pointer to jump all over the screen.
Only issue is that it is a little slow, and I'm fixing that by adding more RAM.
I Love my new computer!
It's now all commodity hardware.
HP didn't fix it.
This causes my wrist to scrape up against it.
Info: Windows failed to load because the kernal is missing, or corrupt.
Does exactly what I bought it 4.
By the time I was finally able to get a work order to get it fixed I had been without my computer for almost a week while I was an Online College Student, so it was very inconvenient and I had to send it off and be without it while it was being fixed also.
Once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts.
Speakers too small to be of any real use.
Web access through the 3G network is so slow, it's very frustrating and VERY DISAPPOINTING.
I've tried going back to XL but there still problems.
I recommend the Macbook Pro if you want the best laptop on the market.
The love part of my relationship with this laptop doesn't take very long.
You can do absolutely anything and is very fast and stylish.
Highly recommend for daily use.
The only task that this computer would not be good enough for would be gaming, otherwise the integrated Intel 4000 graphics work well for other tasks.
Shiny  This Laptop is the Best of the best!
More relieved than anything.
The computer did what it was NOT supposed to do, and I didn't know what to do....
It absolutely is more expensive than most PC laptops, but the ease of use, security, and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag.
It's silent and has a very small footprint on my desk.
returned it.
And if you have a iphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to it at high speed.
it has all the features that we expected and the price was good, working well so far.
She said Wal Mart rants and raves abouy carring Dell because it's a big name but they are a piece of garbage.
But I'm still learning so can't rate it yet for everything.
You can call HP and they want you to buy more software to fix it.
I am overall very pleased with my toshiba satellite, I like the extra features, I love the windows 7 home premium.
Somehow the system clock got messed up after reboot.
I do not like too much Windows 8.
not something you want to miss out on!!!
I took it home and within 30 min, it was freezing up and did the "blue screen of death".
I am not sure if it was the drive itself, however;
Pretty disappointed about this product.
I work in film editing and post production, so I need a laptop that not only has power, but memory and speed as well.
when i first got it i thought the size of it was a joke.
Not easy to carry.
It has surpassed all expectations and fulfilled all my needs.
Good luck with your purchase options.
It has far exceeded my expectations for power, storage, and abilitiy.
4) Laptop still did not work, blue screen within a week...
 Then after paying for it to be examined I was told it was same problem cited on website but I'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty.
With what I paid for this computer it should have had everything on it.
The settings are not user-friendly either.
The case is carved out of a single block of aluminum.
it is really expensive though.
Completely worth every single penny dime and nickel.
this Mac Mini does not have a built-in mic, and it would seem that its Mac OS 10.9 does not handle external microphones properly.
Satisfy what I paid for it.
I sent it to them to fix in perfect condition but for what was wrong with it.
My wireless system would not recognize Windows 7 and I couldn't get online to find out why.
Runs fast and the regular layout keyboard is so much better.
it's just a great toy to have around.
I acually believe the issue is with the Nvidia grafics card, but still requires a return.
I've only had it one day, but I really do love it and I'm happy it was economical and I'm finally able to own a Mac!
While many people brag about Mac being "intuitive", it does take a little time to adjust to coming from a PC, but once I got the hang of it, I don't want to go back.
When it come time for warranty service to Toshiba you don't matter.
WILL NOT EVERY BUY ANOTHER--------LOU
I will upgrade the ram myself (because with this model you can you can do it) later on.
I am so addict to this laptop.
When I got it, I immediately noticed that it was quite heavy and thick and not really attractive.
  I am stuck with a laptop that I cannot do very much with.
I have had many, many issues with PC's in the past and I'm finally glad to have joined the Mac revolution!
I will never buy another HP computer.
The big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies , pictures and etc!
It has a very high performance, just for what I needed for.
Took a while to clean it up to my specs.
Starts up in a hurry and everything is ready to go.
I am pleased to report that it is one of the best presents I have received to date.
Purchased for development purposes, but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing, e-mail, etc.
The battery life is excellent, the display is excellent, and downloading apps is a  breeze.
Looking to take my video and photo editing to the next level, I decided to purchase the MBP 15in Intel Core i5 after reading consumer reviews as well as professional reviews of this laptop.
Features like the font are very block-like and old school.
I've never had problems with viruses.
I am taking back today.
They sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still didn't work.
I took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and I finally paid about 1500 for the extended warranty.
I believe I purchased this in Dec 09 for my primary work laptop which is used 5-10 hours a day, 4-6 days a week.
It is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed.
I know that ASUS is known for making motherboards, but this is the worst computer experience that I have ever had.
It is SO much fun to play with.
My laptop cost approximately $2,300 and DIED after only 2-years, 10-months and 18-days of use.
  But I needed a laptop for school use.
  i have tried to charge on different batteries with no luck.
You will not regret buying this computer!
Please, anyone who is considering getting this computer, stop.
It is the easiest computer I have ever used
That includes transferring my music and movies.
Finally, I couldn't take it anymore and ordered my Apple.
This was a significantly more affordable than getting a new MacBook Pro from Apple.
This mouse is terrific.
The only thing I don't understand is that the resolution of the screen isn't high enough for some pages, such as Yahoo!Mail.
Good in every aspect.
They sent out the box right away for me to send in my computer, they paid postage and whatnot, but when I got my computer back it still wasn't running right, and now my CD drive wasn't reading anything!
I have not have any problems.
( The iBook backup also uses a firewire connection).
The feel of this machine compared to the old MacBook is far superior.
Although my model was listed as recalled, HP denied my claim.
I guess the only good thing that came out of these were the speakers and the subwoofer.
do not buy you will be disappointed.
After paying several hundred dollars for this service, it is frustrating that you cannot get help after hours.
I have been a PC user since middle school, but in my mid twenties I decided to convert to the dark side, or should I say the brighter side of life.
Aside from the trial software and the short battery life, lack of a webcam, its great.
I ordered through MacMall, which saved me the sales tax I would have incurred buying locally.
I wish Toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the OS at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff.
There is no HDMI receptacle, nor is there an SD card slot located anywhere on the device.
no complaints with their desktop, and maybe because it just sits on your desktop, and you don't carry it around, which could jar the hard drive, or the motherboard.
I can guarantee this will be the last Dell I will ever purchase!
Be safe buy a Sony.
dell is a decently made pc.
Out of the box I noticed how small it was and was exactly what I was looking for.
It is speedy when connected wirelessly to any network regardless if the connection is weak or not.
Thank you so much for the great item.
Does a great job with video shot on a Canon 5D MKII.
Once you get past learning how to use the poorly designed Windows 8 Set-Up you may feel frustrated.
It has been nothing but trouble from the time we bought it.
People know what they are talking about and they have pride in the product that they are selling.
although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks.
It wasn't worth it.
Worth the investment and truly a fine piece of equipment.
, Applications respond immediately (not like the tired MS applications).
Best Buy was great as always and accepted the return and gave me another model 1764.
BAck she goes!
I am constantly trying to uninstall programs, clean cookies, and delete unused files.
The computer first started malfunctioning 3 months after purchasing it.
This item is a beautiful piece, it works well, it is easy to carry and handle.
Bought for my daughter to take for starting college this fall - she has been on it non-stop ever since "learning how to use it".
2nd Mac book I have purchased from MacConnection.
Tech support tells me the latter problem is a power supply problem and have offered to fix it if it happens again.
:-)If you buy this - don't go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life, and you'll be perfectly satisfied.
Because it IS a defective product.
The software is amazing.
I also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad.
About 2 months ago i bought the 2011 macbook pro, which was an upgrade from my 2010 macbook pro.
*5 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Apple offers to send replacement after they receive the old computer.
When calling Dell for help, reurn, or a new computer they were not useful and left it up to myself to figure out what to do with it.
Avoid this model.
It was always getting froze up.
I thought it would be a simple job.
I saved about $100 plus tax ordering on Amazon and since I have prime, it arrived overnight for just $3.99 more.
i tried turning it done but it did nothing.
I've been impressed with the battery life and the performance for such a small amount of memory.
and they replaced the awesome ergonomic small lightweight power supply with a power supply that weighed more than the machine itself.
We researched and found the best price at MacConnection.
The ease of use is wonderful.
and the speakers is the worst ever.
Much faster than my old windows laptop that died on me.
I had it four months when my disc drive refused to open.
I'm honestly afraid that it will burn me, it's that hot!
I couldn't afford a new mac, so I bought a PC instead.
Browsing, also, was no problem for me when I used itunes ( which usually slows down my PC ).
It rarely works and when it does it's incredibly slow.
Keyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel.
Not a scratch or mark on it.
With what I do know how to do, the computer works beautiful.
But other than that I am blown away by all the features this laptop offers.
NO good.
They are about the same size keys.
HELP, HELP, OTHER THAN THAT GETS A GREAT LITTLE WONDER.
now he mows yards so he can earn the money for the wireless internet.
Yes, a Mac is much more money than the average laptop out there, but there is no comparison in style, speed and just cool factor.
  They told me to reprogram the computer, and I didn't need  to do that, and I lost pictures of my oldests first 2 years of her  life.
Graphics are much improved.
The screen is bright and vivid and the keyboard is very easy to use, very important for use quick typers.
I have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free, even without the warranty.
This machine is flawless, fast, and classy.
The MBP is beautiful has many wonderful capabilities.
Quality Display  I love HP,, it's the only computer/printer we will buy.
It Was a great deal after all.
But no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it ON THEIR WEBSITE!!!
The most recent being that my Safari internet browser is freaking out on me, but I have just been using firefox instead.
There is no need to open a program first and the cliick open or import.
the features are great, the only thing it needs is better speakers.
very very slow laptop.
I should have kept my big, old HP.
2) Blue screen first month
When I called Toshiba, they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $35 for the phone call, even though they didn't offer any technical support.
Despite the claims of the Apple apologists (a vice of which I am recently myself reformed) the internals of Mac laptops are NO different from PCs' at this point.
The audio volume is quite low and virtually unusable in a room with any background activity.
was debating to buy one for months, checked out different stuff on youtube, and read different articles and debates,I just didnt really wanna spend the money but Im glad that I did.
It's a good fix, in my opinion.
The video chat is the only thing that is iffy about it but im sure once they unpdate the next version on the macbook book the quality of it will be better.
No Viruses!
Not as fast as I would have expect for an i5.
It was important that it was powerful enough to do all of the tasks he needed on the internet, word processing, graphic design and gaming.
However, my girlfriend realized that the netbook's hinge is a bit loose (when you open or close the LCD).
This is my first computer purchase
:] It arrived so fast and customer service was great.
I did an internet search and this is a very common problem with this  laptop.
I fell in love with it.
They're easy, fun, powerful and will last a long time.
Waited on getting this computer, but it has been a great change.
In the three years I've had my MacBook Pro, I have never had a virus on my computer, and I do a lot of work on the internet.
The leather carrying case, keyboard and mouse arrived in two days from Memphis warehouse.
Either way the entire thing was just a joke, a complete rip off!
Screen, keyboard, and mouse: If you cant see yourself spending the extra money to jump up to a Mac the beautiful screen, responsive island backlit keyboard, and fun multi-touch mouse is worth the extra money to me alone.
I would definitely recommend checking out this laptop if you are in the market for one.
Its fast, has High definition quality in the videos.
I can never go back to a PC now, this machine never freezes or has any problems.
But if you can't make your product last more than a year, you will not get my business again.
I should have bought one a long time ago.
Then HP sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up, not able to connect.
I would rate this computer at 5 stars, but considering it has a short life span I can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine.
So i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer
it was a tough choice.
I bought it during the recent Comex IT show.
I was even able to uninstall McAffe and install one of my Symantec licenses with a no issues whatsoever.
Oh my goodness-I am not a happy camper.
I have full control at all times of what is going on - there is no control+alt+delete business anymore.
Everything about the Mac is not only visually appealing, but very easy to use.
Though please note that sometimes it crashes, and the sound quality isnt superb.
I had finally reached my limit and broke down.
This is no exception.
If you really want a bang-up system and don't need to run Windows applications, go with an Apple;
No big deal.
Also, it hardly ever crashes.
Summary: I've had this laptop for 2 months, out of the blue the power adapter stops working.
the two of us use it regularly.
It's just what we were looking for and it works great.
We decided we would try to trade-in our old ones.
I like the operating system.
Meets my needs perfectly and is light enough for this senior to carry without affecting my arthritis.
Most everything is fine with this machine: speed, capacity, build.
This is an over-sized, 18-inch laptop.
     First it burned or fused the power adapter plug.
Small and light weight.
without a big ol' clunky machine in my backpack, I feel like I can do programming homework anywhere.
great price free shipping what else can i ask for!!
Oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all I use the old word processer which works good.
I am not much of a computer techie, so I can understand some of the internal problems, though I do have trend micro as an antiviral program.
I spent alot of money on this product and its been a nightmare.
I think that they are the best out on the market.
The first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty.
Mostly I love the drag and drop feature.
overall i would recomend this to anybody and tell them that if they want to burn their music or play there video games to buy the cd drive.
The feature are good enough for what I need.
It doesn't bother me though.
The processor is very quick and effective as I load webpages and applications.
Eventually the screen went blank and the computer would not turn on.
I was taught to use Photoshop and was amazed.
Screen - although some people might complain about low res which I think is ridiculous.
I love the quick start up.
and it fits in my briefcase with ease
A lot of features and shortcuts on the MBP that I was never exposed to on a normal PC.
Super light, super sexy and everything just works.
If you could stretch by a few 100 dollars I highly recommend you should replace your Windows laptop with this one.
It is made of such solid construction and since I have never had a Mac using my iPhone helped me get used to the system a bit.
We didn't because it was already over 2,400 dollars!
i had to return it for a replacement.
Who makes a laptop that can't rest on your lap?
This netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop (my wife and I have another laptop), or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks.
Windows is also rather unsteady on its feet and is susceptible to many bugs.
I regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use.
Its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my laptop.
air has higher resolution but the fonts are small.
Can you buy any laptop that matches the quality of a MacBook?
Clearly, there is something wrong with the product and LG didn't take up the responsibility.
Overall for the money this is a good deal.
It was also suffering from hardware (keyboard) issues, relatively slow performance and shortening battery lifetime.
The only thing i can say is that the touch pad doesnt work like it should all the time.
Made interneting (part of my business) very difficult to maintain.
  After that the said it was under warranty.
But the performance of Mac Mini is a huge disappointment.
I my wife is also now the proud owner of a Macbook as well!
Within a few hours I was using the gestures unconsciously.
All in all, I'm incredibly dissatisfied with this laptop, and with HP as a whole.
I got the blue screen of death the first month I got it.
The biggest problem is that the box had no instructions in it.
The battery life has not decreased since I bought it, so i'm thrilled with that.
This hardware seems to be better than the iMac in that it isn't $1400 and smaller.
Hmmm - that high failure rate sure isn't reflected in the retail price.
The Mini's body hasn't changed since late 2010- and for a good reason.
Skype is just so dang cool with this machine too.
Sony parts reliability and quality of service is recenlty the worst.
This purchase opened me to the world of Macbooks, and I am impressed with the intuition of the design, the beauty of the product, and the excellent technological advances associated with it.
This is a great computer.
If you are looking for something reliable, this is the laptop for you.
Then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running.
But, for the cost this is a winner.
The majority of the reviews seem to be for the 13.3 MacBook Pro  Model # MD101LL/A.
Then just the other day, my left "mouse" button snapped!
I have owned it only two months!
That's right, no power, absolutely NOTHING.
I can't say enough good for it!
So having the AC plug go out on me and get lose or I could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good.
When you call tech support you were routed to someone who was in another country and did not know what they were doing.
another satisfied customer.
The troubleshooting said it was the AC adaptor so we ordered a new one.
Love that it doesn't take up space like a regular computer.
They replaced it and so far so good.
I would recommend this product.
I think this ps was manufactured in the mid 90's.
So happy with this purchase, I just wish it came with Microsoft Word.
But I am glad to have gotten mine right before they stopped making it.
  It's a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them.
I used to build my own desktops from the component parts, and recently my 7 year old Pentium 4 with HT 1 GB ram SATA desktop stopped working (this was a rock star 7 years ago).
It's fast, it's easy easy easy to set up, easy to hook to my wireless network.
It works great and I am so happy I bought it.
If you are a person like me, more on the creative side, the mac has something for you too.
It has many great programs, such as ILife, iPhotos and others.
I left the place angrily.
After numerous calls to Applecare tech support, I was directed to send in my computer;
If that is the case, then I am completely happy
I complain again...
I look forward to years of use, it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well.
My computer froze on several occasion, had buttons that randomely would fall off and even had moments when the computer would refuse to turn on at all.
After 5 months of failed repairs, requested a full refund but was refused and it still is not repaired and Acer is indifferent to the issue.
This computer that I have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard functions.
At first when I got this product, I loved it.
It provides much more flexibility for connectivity.
So, if you're thinking of a laptop, I would heartily recommend theApple 13.3 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer (Z0J80001) Notebook for all your needs!
  I found this laptop on sale for under 6000 at Best Buy which was a great deal!
Its seen in movies, sitcoms, prominent important people carry and use them and they are GREAT!
I had the computer for a full year and it was a new computer.
So this review might be a tad bit bias.
HAVING HAD EXPERIENCE WITH A TOSHIBA LAPTOP, I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT THE TOSHIBA NB305 LAPTOP HAS MAJOR PROBLEMS.
Plus it is small and reasonably light so I can take it with me to and from work.
Overall, this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from.
It does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern.
The Genius at the Apple store advised me that there was nothing about my use of the computer that caused this failure.
Replaced this one with my mac that was stolen, its a great computer.
Right size and weight for portability.
It was kind of a rebellion against PC in fact, and I am certainly glad I did.
THis computer may be small but it is one heck of a power horse.
Instead of taking another chance on Toshiba, I went with an Asus G73JH-x3.
They say it could be the motherboard again, but Dell
Still under warrenty so called Toshiba, no help at all.
  upon giving them the serial number the first thing I was told, was that it was out of warranty and I could pay to have it repaired.
 A MONTH LATER, we reinstall the OS (Vista).
The pro is a great product, I wish that the 13 inch models came with the Intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge (the edges hurt my wrists).
I was happy with My purchase of a Toshiba Satellite L305D-S5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the Toshiba Warranty.
The macbook rarely requires a hard reboot.
I hate the display screen and I have done everything I could do the change it.
Lord HAVE MERCY!
It's also fairly easy to use the Operating System.
I've been a PC user and I just finally switched and I am never going back.
It is quiet and a real joy to watch work.
Just beware no DVD slot so when I went to install software I had on CD I couldn't.
99 to  fix it.
It does not even have the software to play a dvd now.
  After the warrenty expired the hard drive went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace.
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse.
When you look at the specs on Apple products in comparison to a Dell or a HP, yes they do seem to offer less for a higher cost.
Looking online, many people are having the same problem.
thanks for great service and shipping!
I have nothing to regret from this new product.
The large screen gives you the option to comfortably watch movies or TV shows on your computer instead of buying an additional TV for your dorm room.
It is much better than the Acer ultrabook I had before.
My MacBook is faster than any comparable PC.
The battery life was shorter than expected.
been a PC user for many, many years.
I'm pretty sure when I bought it, my bank account went 'ouch!
The materials that came with the computer did not include the right # anywhere.
Unfortunately, the laptop I purchased was also a Dell and again, I have to say i hated it.
Also, I issued a replacement RMA for a few dead pixels in the upper zone of the screen, which is noticable to me.
I have a business website and every time I have to change something I have to go to the public library to use a PC.
I decided to buy a few notebooks for my nephews for Xmas.
The laptop is very lightweight, can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight.
Treat yourself to a more expensive, long-lasting laptop of quality like a Sony, Apple, or Toshiba.
Maybe not the cutting edge (Satellite L455D) but it is a workhorse.
I have had my MacBook for almost 6 months and can honestly say that I will NEVER buy another computer if it is not a Mac.
-They say it will take "up to two weeks".
  They informed me that I had around 7 "policies" or viruses on it.
But the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing.
The Macbook pro's physical form is wonderful.
GREAT INVESTMENT!
Although the price is higher then Dell laptops, the Macbooks are worth the dough.
do a quick search on the internet see if im the only one.
Apple "Help" is a mixed bag.
i have dropped mine a couple times with only a slim plastic case covering it.
My laptop worked again for just a while before I started having issues AGAIN.
Still haven't solved this.
Honestly, I spent more time waiting for it to unfreeze then actually doing what I got on there for!
Even so, I like playing online games, so it was wonderful that there is a feature where I can dualboot Windows.
THE FIRST PROBLEM IS THAT THE KEYBOARD FUNCTION IS SIMPLY UNSATISFACTORY.
My friends or children use that when they need to borrow the Net =) When I out grow this Meaning when its old and my oldest child is ready for one she will get this one ANd I will be buying only TOSHIBA!
Both computers started acting extremely slow within the first year of owning them.
-Called headquarters again, they report that TFT panel is broken, should be fixed by the end of the week (week 3).
It is a REAL touchpad, not the toy I saw in other brands.
I tell everyone I see out looking to get this or another Toshiba.
Mac tutorials do help.
Also, HDD secures inside using rails, and there is only one set on the main hard drive.
I got it for Christmas, and I was so excited to set it up!
If you're not wanting to be mobile, this is a good laptop to sit on a desk.
No hassle and no complaints.
I had a USB connect but, i can't use it because it is not compatible.
After the first few months, the computer started crashing about every week.
I bought a HP Pavilion DV4-1222nr laptop and have had so many problems with the computer.
It's so bad that I'm thinking I only got half a battery or something.
I don't have any technical pearls to share.
First, it does not have a push button to open the lid.
  Later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months.
3D rendering slows it down considerably.
I love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the Laptop in the sky!!
Well, they don't care a bunch.
And as for all the fancy finger swipes -- I just gave up and attached a mouse.
I like the brightness and adjustments.
5 months dead again.
The Macbook Pro is the premier choice for college students.
I paid $800 for this computer from my school campus bookstore.
This is the first macbook I have ever had.
I dislike the weight and size, cubersome.
  after trying to get some help he disconnected on me.
I had to install Mountain Lion and it took a good two hours.
I'ts nice to have the higher-end laptops, but this fits my budget and the features I need.
It was an all around waste of money for me.
Enjoy using Microsoft Office!
It is light and the battery last a very long time.
Im very happy with this computer!
It has good speed and plenty of hard drive space.
The price was very good, and the product is top quality.
The "abuse" is that I pushed the power plug in too hard.
It's not inexpensive but the Hardware performance is impressive for a computer this small.
The rep did not even answer my question, I had to ask him, if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he didn't even try to acknowledge my question.
I use my friends and family's $2000 laptops and they are fast and reliable and HP, well, I'll never buy or recommend an HP to anyone!
By week two, my laptop had overheated and was completely dead even though I did not use it too much.
I love the Apple products.
So far so good with this laptop.
My dad has one of the very first Toshibas ever made, yes its abit slow now but still works well and i hooked to my ethernet!
To be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk.
Features such as the Dashboard (allows you to view frequently used tools like a calculator, weather forecast, movie times, calendar, computer post its etc.
however, they were kind enough to send a replacement free of charge.
With a healthy pessimism, I took the machine home and tried to find a flaw.
But then, something goes wrong.
If upgrade is possible to the full Windows 7, then I will truly be a very happy geek.
It's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook.
It's wonderful for computer gaming.
  Also, the battery does not last very long at all.
It allows me to do everything I need from a computer and more.
Second, it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated
The operating system and user interface is very intuitive, and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing.
It has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp.
Despite the inconvenient weight, I opted for the 12 cell battery.
If so, you may be having similar problems.
I am pleased with the fast log on, speedy WiFi connection and the long battery life (>6 hrs).
It took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back.
I would recommend Mac, and do, to anyone looking to buy a new computer.
Great purchase and I definitely didn't miss out on the Black Friday deals.
not the day received.
I'm already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown.
I have a laptop as my regular computer, but found that disconnecting it and lugging it around was a drag.
And if you are switching from a pc I hilghy sugest this one.
Having someone give you a quick tour of how to's is the best.
It is super easy to use.
my niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that doesn't require a dedicated video card.
Windows also shuts the computer down for no reason without warning.
Only problem that I had was that the track pad was not very good for me, I only had a problem once or twice with it, But probably my computer was a bit defective.
This laptop is a great price and has a sleek look.
If this would be your first Mac purchase then I would highly suggest that you take advantage of the class that they offer to learn about the differences between Mac and PC's.
The newer MacBook that I have purchased is one of the best computers.
It is small enough to fit in one of my purses!
If you get a lemon (I have two thirds of my  Macs), you have to send it in for repairs several times before they will replace it, even if they have numerous problems with the same version of their computers.
Then the hard drive failed;
Its not just slow on the internet, its slow in general.
I am please with the products ease of use; out of the box ready; appearance and functionality.
I fine Apple MC373LL/A 2.66GHz 15" Macboook Pro Notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go.
For the use it was purchased for it is a good Laptop.
  The hard drive crashed as well, and I had to buy a new  power cord.
I paid for extra memory and the 17-inch screen, as well as the top of the line DVD and CD burners.
During that time, I had to send it back 3 times.
I honestly love my mac, thats why I am a self proclaimed mac addict.
So, I took it back to the apple store and they narcissist genius bar staff) fixed it by resetting the fan at boot up.
I bought my macbook a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since.
Needless to say a PC that can't support a cell phone is less than useless!
My first laptop was an Acer that I got for Christmas.
Next, most Acer laptop fans are on the bottom which is right on your laptop.
It discharges too quickly.
I have never had to shut down the computer unexpectedly and the computer has never froze on me.
they have not sent a new one nor called.
The performance is awesome.
I own a Hewlett Packard laptop and I've had man problems with it since I bought in in Feb, 201
I love the feel of the key board, as well as the trackpad.
I'm definitely not hard on laptops and guarantee 100% that no liquid has touched this machine in my presence.
The new Macbook Pro 15 inch i7 is nothing short of amazing.
I had to pay for the shipping!
So far, so good.
they had to replace the motherboard in April
We purchase the Dell XPS several years ago for my home business.
It is so great, I can Hardly ever take my hands off it!
I enjoy having apple products.
Everything else just install and go.
however, I may have inadvertently thrown out one of the batteries with the shipping carton.
I wish it had a webcam though, then it would be perfect!
This was the same problem with my MacBook (circa 2007) that I just retired.
With all the goodies inside this machine, it is a value.
In the past few years, I've had terrible experiences with HP.
The magnetic plug-in power charging power cord is great (I even put it to the test by accident)- excellent innovation!
10 hours of battery life is really something else....
It is the worst laptop ever
The Apple engineers have not yet discovered the delete key.
It's super fast and a great value for the price!
They aren't worth the money, even though they are on the cheap side, laptop speaking.
I am very pleased with my purchase!
All-in-all, I would definitely recommend this product for nearly everyone.
I am going to go back and return at Store I bought from!
Keyboard is great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable.
Probably won't work either.
After talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate, I chose the MacBook Pro over the white MacBook.
After 3 pleasant weeks of use, the laptop just died.
It's so nice that the battery last so long and that this machine has the snow lion!
I needed something affordable from Apple and was tired of dealing with PC laptop after PC laptop.
:) In the past four years I've had it I have never once gotten a virus.
10 plus hours of battery...
Amazing machine.
I already own an iPhone, and so the move just made more sense.
I think that was a great decision to buy
Very light and easily maneuverable.
-I give up on my data, I just want a computer reasonably fast...
The battery life is excellent- 6-7 hours without charging.
wow the new macbook pro hanged as i tried to type this review.
I sent it back to Toshiba twice they covered it under the  warranty.
Thank God for "ctrl Z"Bottom line, I've been using laptops since the mid 90s and probably the majority of brands out there.
So noise is reduced at least 50% and the heat is much better, now it doesn't feel hot but warm.
believe me apple has a reputation.
Later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months.
  EVENTUALLY we pushed hard enough to convince them that this was the MACHINE that was causing the problems.
  I constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed.
I can't imagine EVER buying a PC again!
There are differences that you need to know and take time to learn.
Not too expense and has enough storage for most users and many ports.
The only thing that isn't perfect about this netbook is the speakers, they are not loud at all but I expected that.
As a lifelong Windows user, I was extremely pleased to make the change to Mac.
The keyboard is top notch.
I love the form factor.
  I managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me.
I bought it to my son who uses it for graphic design.
-4 RAM slots, 2 HDD Bays*, 16GB RAM support -No Wireless Issues, at least for me.
It came in brand new and works perfectly.
Needs Power and Mouse Cable to Plug in back instead of side, In the way of operating a mouse in small area.
I got it back again and was told the motherboard had been replaced, so I was now on the SECOND motherboard within 3 months.
It's face and depanable.
It suddenly can not work.
  Only a few days after I received the computer back, the screen froze again.
It is easy to navigate and update programs.
User upgradeable RAM and HDD.
The Mac takes about the same amount of starting-up time as the average PC, but keeps itself cleaned up and ready to use.
Love it so far.
Screen is crystal clear, yes it's small - but it's a netbook!
You may just lose 1 customer for now.
Took several hours with customer support before I could even start the PC out of the box.
The bottom-line is that this laptop just isn't worth it.
I have had the netbook for 2 months and I love it, I read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other computers I use.
Also, the extended warranty was a problem.
Handles all my basic media needs easily.
Again, decent comp for the price, and I was in need of one quickly as my other laptop died on me.
With a MAC computer I have more free time as I don't have to wait for windows to boot up or shut down and all the viruses associated with windows.
So I'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority.
Congratulations Asus for creating one big piece of dump which is my laptop.
First off, I really do like my MBP... once used to the OS it is pretty easy to get around, and the overall build is great... eg the keyboard is one of the best to type on.
The few things that are wrong with it are very minor things.
The battery life is great.
No I am generous calling it slow.
Such as PAGES, NUMBERS, and so on.
I would not recommend this to anyone wanting a notebook expecting the performance of a Desktop it does not meet the expectations.
  I will definitely be getting a new laptop if it has any more issues after the warranty expires and researching carefully when I do so I don't run accross a situation like this again!
I love the size, keyboard, the functions.
This computer was bought because I wanted "top of the line", fast, reliable, HA.
Great Performance and Quality.
My laptop is almost 2yrs old and I have never had any problems with it.
We'll save our money to replace it with a Mac again!
There is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle, and when I click on it it says: " Consider replacing your battery" and it does not hold full charge.
I do transcription work on the side, and the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well.
The battery has never worked well.
If I have a few hundred dollars to spare, I'd buy the Pro line though, the 2.53 and 2.66 GHz model.
If someone called me an Apple Fanboy...it would make sense.
So don't get it.
I have owned at least 4 to 5 laptops and computers - but this is by far the most superior machine I have ever owned.
Honestly, I am surprised no one else has mentioned returning theirs.
Took me 11 hours, 3 trips to different FedEx offices, and brutal conversations with 14 of the worse IT support technicians in the world.
its sad because their commercials are great.
Got this Mac Mini with OS X Mountain Lion for my wife.
I do not recommend this company or their products!!!!
I bought this Macbook Pro from Best Buy under a year ago to replace my old Macbook Air.
I enjoy very much my new Toshiba, purchased specifially for attending online schooling.
it is hard to fix and makes it a hassle to own one.
This computer is also awesome for my sons virtual home schooling.
I was concerned that the downgrade to the regular hard drive would make it unacceptably slow but I need not have worried - this machine is the fastest I have ever owned...
Not sure on Windows 8.
I like the Mini Mac it was easy to setup and install, but I am learning as I go and could use a tutorial to learn how to use some of the features I was use to on the PC especially the right mouse click menu.
I finally decided on this one and couldn't be any happier.
(The SATA controller is the motherboard chip that lets the CPU talk to the hard drive.)
It's not like I have used for half a year and then complained about it.
-Apparently, contactus@euro.apple.com is not a good address to send complaints.
I realize that not every unit has this issue, but the ones that do cannot be repaired.
Good monitor and performed well.
It started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it was plugged in (mousing over the battery icon would read, for example, "74%, plugged in, not charging"), requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge.
You will regret it if you buy any dell.
I was a little weary at purchasing another 13" macbook almost 2 years later but t looks like the newer macbooks have gotten its current line of graphics cards in order this time around.
Exactly that, users.
The DVD burner broke after burning 3 DVD'd during that time!
while the keyboard itself is alright, the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the mouse command buttons.
My problem was with DELL Customer Service.
So it was only about 2 weeks ago.
  So, buyers beware!
I use the computer to basically check emails, surf the web, print coupons and for my college papers.
It's fast, quiet, incredibly small and affordable compared to other Mac models.
The cool thing about this is anyone can use it.
GET THIS MACHINE
The reaction of Toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter.
Those moments in thime where you want to throw something against the wall? Yeah, I wanted to throw that lap top out the window and light it on fire.
It had some kind of pre installed software update that completely shut the computer down when you clicked it.
Not to mention sometimes the whole charger unit will decide not to work entirely.
Their products, including the MBP, are beautiful, sleek and clever.
But enough about that, I am an Apple convert for life.
The ultimate graduation gift.
And the screen on this thing is absolutely amazing for high quality videos and movies and gaming.
Purchased a Toshiba Lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out.
I'm going to try and keep my old G4 on the road for as long as possible.
If this is an improvement in Customer Service then I would hate too see what it was before!
Great Laptop for the price, works well with action pack games.
I went from a Macbook to this Mac Mini and this was a great upgrade!
It was a Waste of money from day one!
This netbook went bad on me after 3 days.
If you're looking for a great laptop, you've found the best here.
If you find yourself in the market for a new laptop (and have the money) don't exclude looking at the MBPs.
We used PC products - it seemed simpler to continue with the same thing.
Also consider the MS Office apps are all trial versions, hope you have your own copies.
So in late March, early April 2009 I was without it again for a couple weeks while I had online courses I had to complete and my fiance was in Afghanistan and web conferencing was the best communication method we had.
Every day I had this computer, something failed on it.
Theres also iDVD, a program dedicated to putting all your favorite media together- photos, recordings, video projects into one program so that you can create the perfect memoir for your parents, family, siblings, and any other person important in your life that there may be.
And the warranty on this macbook pro can last up to 5 years or 1000 battery recharge cycles.
-Complied to their protocol, called number, made "case", got an email address to send complaint.
This system came loaded with Windows 7 Starter.
Im glad that it has such great features in it.
The OS is easy, and offers all kinds of surprises.
I got this at an amazing price from Amazon and it arrived just in time.
This is the first Apple product that I have purchased.
I do not plan on going back.
I love this product because it is Toshiba and its 15.6".
The price is 200 dollars down.
the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have.
THIS is what a laptop is supposed to be.
The shop will definitely push the problem to the service center.
they improved nothing else such as Resolution, appearance, cooling system, graphics card, etc.
Anyway, in early July of this year, the DVD burner stopped working, and the computer stared having issues with power supply.
I love the Mac so much better than my work PC!
On the twelfth day that I had the notebook, I decided to go to Dell's website and update it.
But for those of you that dont have a mac and are still on the PC's this is a good foot in the door into mac.
I went right out and purchased another laptop.
What can I say.
Even though it is running Snow Leopard, 2.4 GHz C2D is a bit of an antiquated CPU and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running Office Mac applications such as Word or Excel.
I upgraded from a 5 year old laptop and was amazed to find out that this computer is much slower then my old laptop.
Its ease of use and the top service from Apple- be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar- cannot be beat.
I liked the aluminum body.
Am very glad I bought it, great netbook, low price.
This is definitely a computer worth the money;
but it came back in even worse shape.
might have to buy one for me now, since I use it all the time.
It has a lot of memory and a great battery life.
However, you have to adjust yourself to what it will do, not what you want it to do.
They are simpler to use.
I Hate it!
While we struggle with all the crashes and viruses, the kids computers stay consistent and so we caved in and bought one for buisness!
Drivers updated ok but the BIOS update froze the system up and the computer shut down.
It didn't come with any software installed outside of windows media, but for the price, I was very pleased with the condition and the overall product.
The machine is used, but is like new, i'm very impress.
Nice screen, keyboard works great!
but other then that I would give this product a 4 in hafe stars.
it definitely beats my old mac and the service was great.
Almost 4 years ago I bought what was then the current, up to date HP Pavilion--If I recall correctly, it was the dv 1300 t.
So I called Compaq, and after being on the phone for 3 hours, i finally got a replacement which I shouldn't have had a problem getting since it was under warranty.
I noticed windows has a new system called Windows 7, what about us Vista users?  They should get all the bugs out of Vista before investing in a new system.
It's a bummer and one out of five is being kind.
Emachines says they're waiting for a part and refuses to replace entire unit.
My husband got me this for Chrismas after getting me a very expensve laptop that did not work after 2 days.
It was at my door in less than 24 hours.
The screen takes some getting use to, because it is smaller than the laptop.
One of them seems to have worked.
Even out of warranty!
  This thing is a lemon.
Size: I know 13 is small (especially for a desktop replacement) but with an external monitor, who cares.
It is so simple to use, I use it more than my desktop.
That system is fixed.
  Another two weeks later and it was back in my possession.
That defeated the whole point of a laptop.
They are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site.
Apple continues to shine and provide a much more enjoyable computer experience!
The device speaks about it self.
  Toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought Toshiba will do nothing about it.
Of course, eMachines cannot be made entirely to blame for this computer's woes;
I should have sent it back to them then.
One more tip, please purchase this model and get a 4GB stick of RAM to save you $10
If you don't like fingerprints, this might not be the laptop for you.
I had the same reasons as most PC users: the price, the overbearing restrictions of OSX and lack of support for games.
I have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it fixed because it has had viruses 3 times and i have not even had it for more then 4 months!
Was disappointed to find out that the model had been discontinued, apparently because of known motherboard problems.
 THE MOTHERBOARD IS DEAD !
There are several programs for school or office use (Pages, Numbers, Keynote, etc.), music (Garageband), photo management (Photo Booth, iPhoto), video-editing or movie-making (iMovie), etc.
The battery life, before the battery completely died of course, left much to be desired.
First the screen goes completely out.
  The board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues.
The games included are very good games.
A lot of help they WEREN'T!
Most of my papers could not be saved and when they could be, half the time, the papers were then erased.
The computer is currently in West Verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by Toshiba.
I BOUGHT THEM FOR MY COLLEGE AGE GRANDCHILDREN AND THESE MACS ARE TOTALLY RELIABLE AND SUPPORT THEIR CLASS WORK 100% OF THE TIME.
it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once.
and looks very sexyy:D  really the mac book pro is the best laptop specially for students in college if you are not caring about price.
I'm not going to lie, I've never really liked the Acer brand in general.
It's annoying very much and I won't ever buy any Acer products.
Easy to install also small to leave anywhere at your bedroom also very easy to configure for ADSl cable or wifi.
Plain and simple, it(laptop) runs great and loads fast.
Its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer.
I would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of grabage.
It's applications are terrific, including the replacements for Microsoft office.
I love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention PC's require.
The DVD drive randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well, which is annoying.
LOVE IT I've always been an apple fan boy, but never had the money to buy a mac, only ipads and iphones, and this is my first mac, blew me away completely.
I called their repair depot as was told they would send Me a new box to return the computer to the repair depot.
I had my computer custom built from Sonystyle.com.
  The lcd screen stopped working on mine after 10 months.
Needs longer lasting battery, More than 1 to 2 Hrs.
Yeah, of course smarty pants "fix it now")Software - Compared to the early 2011 edition I did see inbuilt applications crashing and it prompted me to send the report to Apple (which I promptly did).
Not to mention it has shit gigs.
A seventy dollar mouse!
STOPPED BOOTING UP less than a week after my one-year warranty was up.
Buy it, love it, and I promise you won't regret it.
It's a great product for a great price!
I wanted it for it's mobility and man, this little bad boy is very nice.
The mouse is a little bit different than what you're used to though- it has one big flat panel and one full bar (instead of two separate ones) to click with- but you get used to it quite quickly.
The speed difference is next to NOTHING for a mac, and the hard drive can be manually upgraded or you could just buy a $60 500gb external hard drive.
We use the built in tools often, iTunes is open nearly every day and works great with my iPhone.
Not only are the versions of these programs able to be saved, worked on and opened on both a PC and Mac, the versions of these programs on a Mac are graphically and functionally superior.
Obviously, this Macbook is P-E-R-F-E-C-T for me because it does exactly what I need in an easy-to-function way.
Lightweight and the screen is beautiful!
I could not handle it one hand like I can the replacement computer I purchased.
The keyboard feels good and I type just fine on it.
Second HDD cover has walls inside that need to be broken if you what to install one.
Exactly as posted plus a great value.
Further, this Mac Mini has a sloppy Bluetooth interface (courtesy of the Mac OS) and the range is poor.
I am having a friend look at it , but will probably return it.
I would recomend this acer to parents and grandparents it can really help them in school.
while about 8 years ago, I hope that the quality has changed.
They claim call center is still down.
It is easy to use, has great screen quality, and every so light weight.
Also kinda loud when the fan was running.
Strong build though which really adds to its durability.
A great feature is the spotlight search: one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword, rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document.
IT WANT TAKE IT, IT KEEP SAYING ERROR.
I returned the 2nd laptop for a full refund.
I have never really been big on downloading anything so I wasn't too worried about getting a virus, plus I thought I was protected by Norton.
the key bindings take a little getting used to, but have loved the Macbook Pro.
It was weird.
Back then my entire family was Devoted to the Sony name.
My Macbook was worth (after 3 years of use!) $375.
taking it back less than 24 hours of purchase
And Toshiba is a quality supplier.
the laptop was really good and it goes really fast just the way i thought it would of run.
Applications open in seconds and there are no lags, hiccups or awkward moments when you wonder whether your computer is out for tea.
After doing CAD work all day at work, using a higher end PC, I couldn't come home and settle for the use of a lower end computer.
After replacing the spinning hard disk with an ssd drive, my mac is just flying.
Oh and if thats not bad enough it doesn't come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $25 for two cds.
I did a lot of research and ended up thinking this Toshiba was the best one for me.
Then it ceased charging at all.
I only wish this mac had a CD/DVD player built in.
I came from the Dell Laptops and now I am so glad I switched when I needed a new laptop.
The battery life seems to be very good, and have had no issues with it.
I love this program, it is superior to windows movie maker.
You better believe my next computer will be a MAC!
5) Cut my losses and sold it for parts
Does everything I need it to, has a wonderful battery life and I couldn't be happier.
All my devises “talk” to each other.
The reason why I choose apple MacBook because of their design and the aluminum casing.
The quality, engineering design and warranty are superior--covers damage from dropping the laptop.
Now, the next issue I had freaked me out.
I've had hp desktop for over 4 yrs now and not one days goes by that i don't regret buying it.
The price premium is a little much, but when you start looking at the features it is worth the added cash.
big mistake!
I can't say enough of how satisfied I am with their product and help aftermarket.
Bottom line, if you can afford it, get a Mac!
I love my Apple, it is quick and easy to use.
Oh yeah, don't forget the expensive shipping to and from HP.
As a die-hard Windows enthusiast, I shunned the idea of a Mac until this point.
  i dont understand why i spent twice as much to get a laptop rather than a desktop when my lap top is completely immoble.
Do you ever think HP would do that? NEVER!
The only time I have restarted is during system updates.
That day!
I had my PC laptop for 3 years and going to a MacBook Pro is like I leaped through time.
I don't do any high tech stuff on it, just write papers, check mail, and sometimes play games, so I can't reccomend it if you are in the computer field.
after much effort and 10 days ASUS replaced itThe WiFi is very weak.
For example, when my husband turns the light out while I'm on the computer.
If anything, I would only suggest using one of these laptops if only you have to.
Dell Latitude d620 is not a reliable machine.
This just keeps having it's hard drive replaced!
I got tired of buying laptops and having them stop working after a year.
Will not buy another Toshiba, this is my second, not happy w/ either.
You may soon mistake my digitus medius as a lively pogo stick.
the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch-pad making the touch-pad hard to use when using headphones/mic, not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person.
I really like the size and I'm a fan of the ACERS.
  After 4 days, being denied 6 times and told off once, I managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt.
-Managed to send complaint email.
The great 18 month same as cash financing and Advance Protection Plan which includes accidents like spills .
Searched it on amazon and on bestbuy.
I have loved this since i took it out of the box.
This laptop has only 2 USB ports, and they are both on the same side.
This is my first Dell I heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it!
also you may need to charge it once a day, if for medium use every thing fast and easy with mac  the size and look is the most feature that attracted me to it.
It is VERY easy to type on and feels great - besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted.
Nightly my computer defrags itself and runs a virus scan.
If you start on the far right side and scroll to your left the start menu will automatically come up.
It also does not have bluetooth.
The built quality is really good, I was so Happy and excited about this Product.
I have a lapdesk which I can use, but I can still feel the heat through the foam and plastic.
A SECOND PROBLEM INVOLVES THE BATTERY WHICH IS ADVERTISED AS HAVING A STORAGE LIFE OF 11 HOURS BUT WHEN FULLY CHARGED SHOWS ONLY 7 HOURS OF SERVICE.
Summary: They played games with me for the warranty period.
The sound is nice and loud; I don't have any problems with hearing anything.
  I was told by many  that it was a great computer, but we got one of these, and it worked  great for one year, and as soon as the warrenty was up, then it got  really bad.
This is a nicely sized laptop with lots of processing power and long battery life.
Garageband is easy to work with, like all the other apple applications I've had experience with.
  Then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me.
Peformance is good for the price.
I bought this Mac book pro along with a new 27" iMac and while they are still light years more reliable than a PC I have noticed a decline in the reliability of my Mac computers.
The screen shows great colors.
It is known as Safari, and if you are doing any website work, you should know that many hosting companies do not support it.
It was old but it was not till we bought the Dell did we realize how great it was.
It is easy to go from one keyboard to another.
The newer black keyboard took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick, but it is still a great notebook!
the whole experiece is horrible so save up and buy a better laptop.
The battery doesn't last long but I'm sure an upgrade battery would solve that problem.
The local computer repair shops send out ads that say along the lines of we can fix almost any problem or computer  usually even the trouble some Toshiba satellite.
I was always against them but now I buying one I'll never go back to PC.
I got this laptop on Black Friday.
I would buy this lap top over and over again!
Screen is crystal clear and the system is very responsive.
I have been a mac user since the mid 90s.
If that is the case for you, I would suggest a pull-behind solution when looking at cases.
It seems to have some opions that are intalled but do not work like I thought they would.
   It has a overheating issue - nearly to the point of being dangerous.
lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small.
on the bright side at least I wasn't without my laptop for long this time!
  They said it was a computer error on this type of computer.
I made the right decision.
Well, maybe more like week one.
Good bye BLUE SCREEN and Critical errors!!!!
I did not have to call the support line at all.
For the not so good, I got the stock screen - which is VERY glossy.
THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIFIC!!
Well, maybe I was just very unlucky.
Ive owned Apple computers and laptops for as long as i could remember.
But in fact it is totally the opposite.
Now I could get myself a cheap computer, that will probably work a whole lot better!
Buying a Mac Mini would allow me to make the transition.
Chatting with Acer support, I was advised the problem was corrupted operating system files.
ASUS has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks, and I would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them.
After replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working  (3 months of use) which was frustrating.
bought notebook 07/2009.
I got this one for thanks giving Offer for $962 :).
I have found it very easy to use, very imformative, wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs.
I always use a backup hard disk to store important files at all times.
After much battling with HP i was able to return it 4 times for repairs.
The price is higher than most lab top out there; however, he/she will get what they paid for, which is a great computer.
of course my warranty runs out next month.
  When I took it back to Best Buy I asked them if they were seriously trying to drive me insane!
I finally own a piece of computing equipment that I don't want to take a baseball bat and destroy.
The computer runs very fast with no problems and the iLife software that comes with it (iPhoto, iMovie, iWeb, iTunes, GarageBand) is all very helpful as well.
But the machine is awesome and iLife is great and I love Snow Leopard X.
So you might ask, what did Apple do for me?
That being said after 2 weeks of owning every time I start it up now it gives me a black screen for 5-8 seconds stating pxe-e61 media test error check cable.
Thanks for the fast shipment and great price.
The computer is a dream come true.
Two of the times was in one month.
I am paying apple to kill my self and my wallet.
But sadly the replacement froze-up while updating the BIOS again and shut down and would not turn back on.
I'm so disgusted that I wasted my money on this product.
Well, I had completed the presentation in powerpoint the night before on my PC, but took the Apple to the conference.
I know there are way better laptops out there for the same price, and why spend money on shit when you can go out and get yourself a perfectly decent laptop that doesnt suck total monkey balls.
The only thing I didn't learn in my research was the software I would need like privacy protection and warranty protection, in case it gets broken, or crashes etc.
Very satisfied.
The on/off switch is a bit obscure in the rear corner.
  I took the computer back in yet again except this time they kept it to send into their Geek Squad headquarters.
I can't believe how quiet the hard drive is and how quick this thing boots up.
You have to toss out the wifi card and replace it just to have any sort of network capability.
Mom, Dad, Brother, sister, You name it!
It was fast, and it was "different".
Whenever tried to turn it on, it would restart as soon as the BIOS launched Windows (or Winblows, as I like ot call it).
Support has been lackluster and now I just want a refund.
apple is one of the best computer companies in the country.
Quite simply this is the best laptop I have ever owned.
I find myself using the 10-key more than I thought I would.
