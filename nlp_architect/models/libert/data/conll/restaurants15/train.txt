Judging	O
from	O
previous	O
posts	O
this	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
good	B-OP
place	B-ASP
,	O
but	O
not	B-OP
any	I-OP

We	O

and	O
the	O

we	O
were	O
imposing	O
on	O
them	O

they	O
were	O
very	O

They	O
never	O

The	O
food	B-ASP
was	O
lousy	B-OP
-	O
too	O
sweet	O
or	O
too	O
salty	O
and	O
the	O
portions	B-ASP
tiny	B-OP

After	O
all	O
that	O

every	O

they	O

is	O
too	B-OP

The	O
only	O

enjoyed	B-OP
was	O
their	O
Grilled	B-ASP
Chicken	I-ASP
special	I-ASP
with	I-ASP
Edamame	I-ASP

I	O
had	O
never	O
had	O

I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
innovative	B-OP

tasty	B-OP
(	O
could	O
've	O
used	O
a	O

if	O
you	O
're	O

rather	O
go	O
across	O

The	O
decor	O
is	O
night	B-OP
tho	O
...	O
but	O
they	O
REALLY	O
need	O
to	O
clean	O
that	O

in	O
the	O

...	O
its	O
quite	O
un-appetizing	B-OP

I	O

not	O
a	O

,	O
almost	O
all	O
the	O

were	O
great	B-OP

Frankly	O

when	O
you	O
compare	O
what	O
you	O
can	O
have	O
here	O
for	O

The	O
food	B-ASP
here	O

but	O
only	O
if	O
you	O

I	O
like	B-OP
the	O
somosas	B-ASP

and	O
the	O
chole	B-ASP
,	O
but	O
the	O
dhosas	B-ASP

were	O
kinda	O
dissapointing	O

The	O
service	B-ASP
varys	O
from	O
day	O

day	O
-	O
sometimes	O
they	O
're	O
very	O
nice	B-OP

and	O
sometimes	O
not	O

The	O
kitchen	B-ASP
however	O

is	O
almost	O

,	O
specify	O

its	O

The	O

pretty	B-OP

nice	B-OP

WAS	O
HORRIBLE	O

The	O

delivered	O
cold	B-OP
and	O
the	O
cheese	B-ASP
was	O
n't	O
even	O
fully	O

!	O

It	O
looked	O
like	O
shredded	O
cheese	O
partly	O
done	O
-	O
still	O
in	O

I	O
have	O
eaten	O

to	O
be	O
one	O
of	O
the	O

restaurants	O
in	O
Brooklyn	O
.	O

The	O
pizza	B-ASP
is	O
overpriced	B-OP
and	O
soggy	B-OP

The	O

are	O
unusual	B-OP

really	O

I	O
almost	O
hesititate	O
to	O
write	O
a	O

the	O
atmosphere	B-ASP
was	O
so	O
great	B-OP
and	O
I	O
would	O
hate	O
for	O
it	O
too	O

The	O

I	O
like	B-OP
Cafe	O

wrong	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
jsut	O
that	O
the	O
people	B-ASP
who	O
work	O
there	O
are	O
evil	B-OP
and	O
incompetent	B-OP
!!	O

The	O
service	B-ASP
was	O
terrible	B-OP
,	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
everything	O
and	O
ask	O
several	O
of	O
different	O
people	O
for	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
before	O
we	O
were	O
allowed	O
to	O
be	O
served	O
.	O

The	O
waitress	B-ASP
,	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
concerned	O
of	O
looking	O
good	O
than	O
actually	O
waitressing	O
.	O

After	O
dinner	O
the	O
manager	B-ASP
grabbed	O
my	O
boyfriend	O
,	O
asked	O
him	O
:	O
Where	O
are	O
you	O
from	O
...	O
maybe	O
you	O
dont	O
know	O
how	O
things	O
work	O
in	O
America	O
...	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
end	O
stormed	O
away	O
almost	O
teareyed	O
yelling	O
that	O
tips	O
are	O
the	O
only	O
thing	O
they	O
survive	O
on	O

We	O
did	O
tip	O

I	O
guess	O
the	O
model/waitress	O
just	O
wanted	O
more	O
and	O
complained	O
to	O
the	O

The	O
whole	O

I	O
wish	O

despite	O
the	O
