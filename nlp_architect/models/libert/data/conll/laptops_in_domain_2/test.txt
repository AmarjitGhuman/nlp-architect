The	O
price	B-ASP

when	O
you	O

at	O
the	O

it	O
is	O
worth	B-OP
the	O
added	O
cash	O

Plus	O
it	O
is	O
small	B-OP

reasonably	O
light	B-OP

I	O
can	O

I	O
get	O
out	O

however	O
I	O
would	O
highly	O
suggest	B-OP
purchasing	O
a	O

due	O
to	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
the	O

there	O

will	O
need	O
to	O

manually	O

frequently	O
than	O
on	O
PC	O

that	O
I	O
've	O

I	O
know	O
there	O
are	O
way	O
better	O
laptops	O
out	O
there	O
for	O
the	O
same	O
price	B-ASP

and	O
why	O
spend	O

on	O

when	O
you	O
can	O
go	O
out	O

get	O
yourself	O
a	O
perfectly	O
decent	O
laptop	O
that	O
doesnt	O
suck	O
total	O
monkey	O
balls	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
I	O
dislike	B-OP
is	O
the	O
touchpad	B-ASP
,	O
alot	O
of	O
the	O
times	O
its	O
unresponsive	B-OP
and	O
does	O
things	O
I	O
dont	O
want	O
it	O
too	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
recommend	B-OP
using	O
a	O
mouse	B-ASP
with	O
it	O
.	O

While	O
lacking	B-OP
some	O
of	O
the	O
functions	B-ASP
of	O
the	O
other	O
versions	O
,	O
this	O
was	O
very	B-OP
acceptable	I-OP
for	O
the	O
uses	O
planned	O
for	O
this	O
computer	O
.	O

But	O
with	O
this	O
laptop	O
,	O
the	O
bass	B-ASP
is	O
very	O
weak	B-OP
and	O
the	O
sound	B-ASP
comes	O
out	O
sounding	O
tinny	B-OP
.	O

After	O
about	O
a	O
week	O
I	O
finally	O
got	O
it	O
back	O
and	O
was	O
told	O
that	O
the	O
motherboard	B-ASP
had	O
failed	B-OP
and	O
so	O
they	O
installed	O
a	O
new	B-OP
motherboard	B-ASP
.	O

We	O
decided	O
we	O
would	O
try	O
to	O
trade-in	O
our	O
old	O
ones	O
.	O

The	O
internet	B-ASP
capabilities	I-ASP
are	O
also	O
very	O
strong	B-OP
and	O
picks	O
up	O
signals	O
very	O
easily	B-OP
.	O

Since	O
I	O
've	O
had	O
this	O
computer	O
I	O
've	O
only	O
used	O
the	O
trackpad	B-ASP
because	O
it	O
is	O
so	O
nice	B-OP
and	O
smooth	B-OP
.	O

I	O
saved	O
about	O
$	O
100	O
plus	O
tax	O
ordering	O
on	O
Amazon	O
and	O
since	O
I	O

A	O
tip	O
for	O

DO	O
NOT	O
BUY	O
IT	O
save	O

money	O

buy	O
a	O

out	O
that	O
this	O

And	O
the	O
warranty	B-ASP
