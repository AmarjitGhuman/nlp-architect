We	O

out	O

in	O
my	O
opinion	O

Every	O

was	O
better	B-OP

the	O
next	O

The	O
food	B-ASP

We	O

It	O
may	O

the	O

The	O

claimed	O
that	O

an	O

You	O

be	O
satisfied	B-OP

The	O
food	B-ASP
is	O
o.k.	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
any	O
better	B-OP
than	O
what	O
you	O
get	O
at	O
a	O
good	O

And	O
forget	O
what	O
you	O

n't	O
that	O
bad	B-OP
either	O

the	O

This	O

We	O
ended	O
up	O

the	O

I	O
do	O

The	O
portions	B-ASP

the	I-ASP

By	O

the	O

Do	O

are	O
only	O
a	O

they	O
are	O
always	O
full	B-OP

The	O
decor	B-ASP
in	O
this	O

is	O
very	O
diner-ish	B-OP

the	O
kind	O
of	O

expect	O
in	O
the	O
East	O

-	O
not	O
romantic	B-OP

just	O
simple	B-OP

small	O

The	O

a	O
bit	O
too	O
small	B-OP
for	O
live	B-ASP

so	O
on	O

Unbelievable	O

What	O
really	O
makes	O
it	O
shine	B-OP
is	O
the	O
food	B-ASP
,	O
which	O
is	O
aggressively	O
seasoned	O
with	O
Cyrpriot	O
spices	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
made	O
in-house	B-OP
(	O
even	O
the	O
gyro	B-ASP

sausages	B-ASP
)	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
of	O
much	O
higher	B-OP
quality	I-OP
ingredients	B-ASP
that	O
might	O
otherwise	O
be	O
expected	O

If	O

they	O

they	O

Admittedly	O
,	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
place	O
for	O
gigantic	O

overflowing	O
the	O
plate	O
(	O
and	O
thank	O
goodness	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
)	O
but	O
for	O
simple	B-OP
,	O
elegant	B-OP
sushi	B-ASP
there	O
is	O
no	O
better	B-OP
place	O
in	O
New	O
York	O
or	O
anywhere	O
in	O
the	O
US	O
.	O

This	O
place	O
is	O
worth	B-OP
going	O
even	O
if	O
only	O
for	O
their	O
beer	B-ASP
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
understand	O
the	O
extraordinary	O
hype	O
about	O
this	O
restaurant	O
.	O

Only	O
wine	B-ASP
and	O
beer	B-ASP
are	O
served	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
house	B-ASP
varities	I-ASP
are	O
actually	O
quite	O
good	B-OP
.	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
I	O
moderately	O
enjoyed	B-OP
was	O
their	O
Grilled	B-ASP
Chicken	I-ASP
special	I-ASP
with	I-ASP
Edamame	I-ASP
Puree	I-ASP
.	O

The	O
most	O
annoying	B-OP
thing	O
,	O
though	O
,	O
is	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
servers	B-ASP
seem	O
to	O
be	O
trained	O
to	O
drive	O
revenue	O
.	O

The	O
restaurant	O
is	O
a	O
bit	O
noisy	B-OP
but	O
that	O
is	O
something	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
overlooked	B-OP
once	O
you	O
sit	O
down	O
and	O
enjoy	B-OP
a	O
great	B-OP
meal	B-ASP

Oh	O
,	O
but	O
wait	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
out	O
of	O
drinks	B-ASP
(	O
which	O
were	O
also	O
delightfully	O
overpriced	B-OP
)	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
by	O

the	O
BEST	B-OP
past	O
in	O
New	O

.	O

I	O
have	O
eaten	O
at	O
many	O
