it	O
does	O

It	O
was	O
a	O

when	O

I	O
wanted	O
to	O
purchase	O
the	O

they	O
refused	B-OP

because	O
they	O

I	O
take	O
it	O

I	O

He	O

I	O

that	O
the	O

I	O

-	O
this	O

the	O

I	O
have	O

I	O
had	O
in	O

a	O

they	O

the	O

they	O
sent	O

The	O

if	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O

that	O

also	O
the	O

you	O
cant	O
see	O
anything	O

thats	O
bad	B-OP

my	O

leaves	O

with	O
no	O

the	O

One	O
drawback	B-OP

I	O
wish	O

its	O
really	O

you	O

I	O

took	O

My	O

purchased	O
a	O

I	O
just	O
ca	O
n't	O

that	O
the	O

I	O
was	O
tired	O
of	O
going	O
without	O
my	O

every	O
few	O

I	O
had	O
static	B-OP

I	O
had	O

I	O
'm	O
pretty	O

it	O

when	O
you	O
turn	O

you	O
just	O

you	O

it	O

I	O

So	O
you	O
might	O
ask	O
,	O
what	O
did	O
Apple	O
do	O
for	O
me	O
?	O

I	O
pondered	O
very	O
long	O
over	O
this	O
decision	O

The	O
Mac	O
takes	O
about	O
the	O

It	O

all	O
the	O

My	O

Every	O

I	O

after	O
a	O

there	O
is	O
this	O
endlessly	O

that	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
through	O

After	O
about	O
a	O
week	O
I	O
finally	O
got	O
it	O
back	O
and	O
was	O
told	O
that	O
the	O
motherboard	B-ASP
had	O
failed	B-OP
and	O
so	O
they	O
installed	O
a	O
new	B-OP

I	O
'll	O
wait	O
and	O
save	O
up	O
for	O
a	O

The	O
keyboard	B-ASP

slick	B-OP

I	O

Everything	O

The	O

However	O
,	O
my	O

realized	O
that	O
the	O
netbook	O
's	O
hinge	B-ASP
is	O
a	O
bit	O
loose	B-OP
(	O
when	O
you	O
open	O

the	O

I	O
use	O

creation	I-ASP
(	O
Audio	B-ASP

its	O
reliable	B-OP

Hmmm	O
-	O
that	O
high	O
failure	O
rate	O
sure	O
is	O
n't	O
reflected	O
in	O
the	O

If	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
case	O
,	O
then	O
I	O
am	O
completely	O

I	O
have	O

I	O

its	O

i	O
recommend	B-OP

All	O
in	O
all	O

dissatisfied	B-OP

If	O
you	O

almost	O
gaurentee	O
that	O
something	O

of	O
gone	O
wrong	B-OP

maybe	O
even	O
forcing	O
you	O
to	O

It	O
was	O
hard	B-OP

Sure	O
,	O
the	O
initial	O
out	O
of	O
pocket	O

is	O
greater	O

that	O
should	O
not	O
dissuade	O
anyone	O
from	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
these	O
machines	O
run	B-ASP
like	O
none	O

on	O
the	O

when	O
