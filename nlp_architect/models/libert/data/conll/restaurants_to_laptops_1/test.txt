it	O

I	O

I	O
would	O
totally	O
recommend	B-OP
any	O

over	O
this	O

would	O
be	O
up	O

because	O

So	O
if	O
anyones	O

the	O
store	O

and	O
it	O
seemed	O
ok	B-OP

The	O
sound	B-ASP
as	O
mentioned	O
earlier	O
is	O
n't	O
the	O
best	B-OP
,	O
but	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
solved	O
with	O
headphones	B-ASP
.	O

My	O
wife	O
also	O
has	O
problems	B-OP
with	O
her	O
Asus	O
-	O
different	O
model	O
.	O

Obviously	O
we	O
both	O
got	O
new	O
Macs	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
extremely	O
portable	B-OP
and	O
easily	B-OP
connects	B-ASP
to	I-ASP
WIFI	I-ASP
at	O
the	O
library	O
and	O
elsewhere	O
.	O

Since	O
I	O
never	O
really	O
got	O
to	O
use	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
ca	O
n't	O
comment	O
on	O
anything	O
except	O
what	O
went	O
wrong	O
after	O
trying	O
2	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
first	O
laptop	O
I	O
've	O
owned	O
,	O
althougth	O
I	O
used	O
several	O
at	O
my	O
previous	O
job	O
.	O

They	O
should	O
have	O
included	O
more	O
memory	B-ASP
on	O
their	O
computers	O
if	O
they	O
knew	O
Vista	B-ASP
would	O
run	O
slowly	O
.	O

although	O
its	O
windows	B-ASP
vista	I-ASP
compared	O
to	O
windows	B-ASP
xp	I-ASP
sucks	B-OP
.	O

Every	O
day	O
I	O
had	O
this	O
computer	O
,	O
something	O
failed	B-OP
on	O
it	O
.	O

This	O
can	O
be	O
annoying	O
at	O
first	O
but	O
you	O
just	O
have	O
to	O
train	O
yourself	O
not	O
to	O
to	O
start	O
over	O
so	O
far	O
.	O

i	O
have	O
dropped	O
mine	O
a	O
couple	O
times	O
with	O
only	O
a	O
slim	B-ASP
plastic	I-ASP
case	I-ASP
covering	O
it	O
.	O

Then	O
they	O
had	O
me	O
jump	O
through	O
many	O
hoops	O
and	O
questions	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
they	O
could	O
find	O
another	O
way	O
to	O
invalidate	O
me	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
extremely	O
fast	B-OP
and	O
very	O
compact	B-OP
