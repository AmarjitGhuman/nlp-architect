Nice place though.
The service was attentive.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!
The food is reliable and the price is moderate.
Wonderful menu, warm inviting ambiance, great service the FOOD keeps me coming back!
Definitely a neighborhood favorite.
As a long-time patron of Mamoun's, I always figured that I had found the best late night food spot in the city.
We have lived in Chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant.
Me and my girls will definitely go back.
Don't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes, they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections.
Great wine list and great cocktail menu.
The appetizing is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable price (if bought by the pound).
I haven't eat a lamb chop as delicious as that,the salads are really nice dressed with lemon and extra virgnin olive oil.
Whether it's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar, you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite.
Cool atmosphere, the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night.
The waitstaff are all very busy, it's not outstanding service, but I've never been dealt with rudely.
Who has room for Cheesesticks with the best pizza in NYC!
Three of us arrived for dinner about 5:30 on a week night without reservations.
I complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted.
The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the cheese is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components.
I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends, and spent three enjoyable hours there.
There was no tap beer that evening, which was a disappointment. 
Appetizer are excellent here; you can make a great (and inexpensive) meal out of them.
I recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys  fine cuisine at reasonable prices.
We had Pam's special fried fish and it was amazing.
Will prob. not return but it is a great dinning experience to try atleast once.
My roommate and I LOVE this place.
I just have nothing to say about this place that is negative except that it's not a cheap night out...but it's SO worth it.
The production is a symphony, alot of fun to experience.The food sublime for the most part.
i dont know what some people who rave about this hot dog are talking about.
Total hipster-wannabe attitude in an otherwise sweet spot.
So, a little inconsistency there but either way, both pizzas were really good.
I came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband.
Just straight up cheap, good food.
Look foward to trying the Ruben upon returning.
The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts.
The sauce is zesty and flavorful and the crust is nice and crispy.
Not a typical pizza joint, but good for a low key and fairly cheap nice sit down dinner.
I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries.
They also have a back garden open in the summer - cute and French with outdoor seating - what more could you ask for?
I guess the way my friends and I described it was The French Colonies.
Nice restaurant overall, with classic upscale Italian decor.
Rao is a good restaurant, but it's nothing special.
Get it together.
The food was terrific and the service classy, attentive, without being overbearing.
(1) turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of Mott St. just south of bayard
The food is flavorful, plentiful and reasonably priced.
I have been to Rao's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better.
Our food was great too!
Stay far away from this place.
They charge $6.00 for rice.
I thought the restaurant was nice and clean.
Then, to top things off, she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend's jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes. 
But, nothing stands out about the cooking.
My husband said he could've eaten several more, the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had.
Disappointingly, their wonderful Saketini has been taken off the bar menu.
Oh, and I never write reviews--I just was so moved by how bad this place was, I felt it was my duty to spread the word.
I consider the best Grand Sichuan restaurant in NYC.
There is no excuse for such lousy service!
This is the BEST Shabu-Shabu Restaurant in the Try-State Area.
The service is fantastic.
I love the drinks, esp lychee martini, and the food is also VERY good.
The filet mignon dish was superb!
I went here in the afternoon with a friend.
It is expensive but well worth the money.
After my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer.
And I could do without the cigar smoke.
I agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience!
Unlike other places in NYC where the sandwiches you want only come as a triple-decker, here you can get what you want in a reasonably-sized portion (and price).
From the appetizers we ate, the dim sum and other variety of foods, it was impossible to criticize the food.
really depends on your luck!
Great beer selection too, something like 50 beers.
The Halibut was too salty, dessert was so so (don't waste any of your calories) and service was poor.
Service is fast and friendly.
When you enter, you feel like you have entered your mom's kitchen.
They have all been tonight and they have all been about the same restaurant.
Our waitress wasn't mean, but not especially warm or attentive either.
No you're going to go back because the food was good.
It's one of our favorite places to eat in NY.
Would recommend - perfect for those looking for a place close to grand central.
I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, "can I help you" and "how many are in your party."
have always had a great time here.
and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs.
Not a very fancy place but very good Chinese style Indian food.
Service was slow, but the people were friendly.
But this place is a well-oiled machine so they know what they're doing.
Then, IF they answer the phone, you're lucky if they don't hang up on you!
Service was prompt, friendly and great.
After waiting for almost an hour, the waiter brusquely told us he'd forgotten to give the kitchen our order.
I'm going back.
We recently spent New Year's Eve at the restaurant, and had a great experience, from the wine to the dessert menu.
The food is so cheap and the waiters are nice.
The wait staff is very courteous and accomodating.
Over all it was a very nice romantic place .
Will go back but only sate those homesick stomach cravings!
The food was bland oily.
We ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun (dessert) recommended by the waiter.
The selection of food is excellent (I'm not used to having much choice at restaurants), and the atmosphere is great.
It is LOUD, HOT and DARK.
Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation.
The Yellowtail was particularly good as well.
You can't say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown.
My wife and I went to Orsay for Valentine's dinner.
Weekends can get crowded, but still highly recommended.
It's a basic pizza joint, not much to look at, but the pizza is what I go for.
If you're in town, it's worth searching for another place.
I have tried to make reservations, but both times, the hostess didn't have my name.
But make sure you have enough room on your credit card as the bill will leave a big dent in your wallet.
The specials are usually quite good too.
Bravissimo !!
I am Indian, and I have tried many Indian places in NY.
The fillings may be unconventional but the dosa batter is definitely authentic and the combinations very tasty.
Once you try it for a special occasion beware.. you can't stop!
They are served on Focacchia bread and are to die for.
Whatever the reason it is definitely the place to be.
And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).
We ended up having to just leave because we were essentially being ignored by the wait staff--even though the rest of the restaurant was largely empty.
We ordered the chicken casserole, but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken, all dark meat and on the bone.
You will find yourself returning quite often.
THe perfect spot.
We had a very nice time.
Once we sailed, the top-notch food and live entertainment sold us on a unforgettable evening.
Good cake BUT: it was not the best cake i've ever had, and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked employees.
We had a girls' night dinner here for restaurant week.
First went here to enjoy their garden terrace.
The waitress came by to pick up the soy sauce WHILE we were eating our lunch!!!!!
We asked for beverages and never received them.
The New York Times has reviewed this place three times already, you know it's going to be good.
Once you step into Cosette, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro.
We all felt it was worth it.
Don Pedro's is one of my favorite restaurants.
Waiters are very friendly and the pasta is out of this world.
While this is a pretty place in that overly cute French way, the food was insultingly horrible.
Emilio, the owner, is often sitting in the front table greeting guests as they come and go.
If you are someone who appreciates the same things but hope to have food to spare or share, Kai may not be the best option.
Last memorial day, I tried to make reservations but was told they were closed that weekend (interesting, but...).
Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon, Sea Bass and Crispy Duck.
Moderate prices.
Everyone I bring here always loves it.
The service does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but I have never been treated rudely.
I didn't expect to like Nosh as much as I did, but the pastrami on challah sandwich I had was otherworldly, the soups are like Mom's, and the knishes give Yonah Schimmel's a run for its money.
The wine list isn't great, and the desserts are shipped in from Bruno's down the street, which is not as good as it used to be.
All toppings are so fresh you'd think they had their own vegetable garden and the crust is so perfect, that one actually thinks of how it was made.
I am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded.
There was a small wait, but shorter than I expected.
The space is traditional in feel.
first it took us a long time to find the place.
We were looking forward to nice glass of Sangria when we arrived.
If just to drop in, quickly stuff yourself and jet out -- to keep their turn-over.
No doubt the next time we want to go out for a special occasion or are entertaining guests from out of town, Spirit and Bateaux will be our destination.
If it's just a quick martini at the bar (which I recommend Jeffery's) or a mind blowing Roast Chicken, go to Village!
I can't remember the last time I had such gross food in New York.
But after last night, Spice Grill is the only place I'm eating indian cuisine.
My husband and I had a blast.
very good breads as well.
Save your money and your time and go somewhere else.
The ambience is very romantic and definitely a good place to bring a date.
The service was superb, they treat you like family.
My wife and I always enjoy the young, not always well trained but nevertheless friendly, staff, all of whom have a story.
Off the beaten path, this jewel of a restaurant shines just one block away from the plethora of 6th street Indian restaurants.
This is one great place to eat pizza more out but not a good place for take-out pizza.
at night, but it's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the music playing in the background is also voluminous.
Dahkin also offers prix fixe lunch and buffet.
It's called Gnochi alla nona and is found under Chef Specials.
The entire dining experience was wonderful!
Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit.
Delicate spices, onions, eggs and a kick-ass roti.
its a little out of the way if you don't live in the neighborhood, but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are.
Food took some time to prepare, all worth waiting for.
While their kitchen food is delicious, their Sushi is out of this world.
The wine list is extensive and impressive.
for my birthday and we had an excellent time.
To speak of the Park Side, words can not describe.
Big Wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach.
I know this is the case in many nyc eateries, but here, they really cram you in to the point where it's borderline uncomfortable.
After being told that our party of three would be seated in 10 minutes and watching other parties (multiples of 2 and higher) seated for 40 minutes, the three of us were squished into a small 2-person table.
Also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side.
We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful.
The food is authentic Italian - delicious!
But $1 for each small piece???
The food and service were fine, however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant.
The food they serve is not comforting, not appetizing and uncooked.
After the review I treked into Brooklyn.
Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable, makes students go back to Suan again and again.
As a student in NYU i need a place to eat after a hard day of work so usually i just go to any indian restraunt near by. 
I went to Common Stock for brunch and I was so impressed.
I have been twice to this restaurant.
Also good for client lunch meetings, esp.
Fresh veggies, all sorts of middle eastern spreads, cheese and falafel, soup, fish, rice, root vegetables, a rice medley, some spinach thing, lamb kebabs, cheese baclava... soooo much fooood, and all of it delicious.
My wife and I went to Water's Edge for a romantic dinner.
We will be back.
One of my favorite places in Manhattan.
I lived on 50th st, and wanted Indian one day so decided to check this place out.
I've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences.
They're rude at times, and not very friendly.
The wait staff is very friendly, if not overly efficient.
highly recommended.
If you go to Roth's try to be served by Mike, he is GREAT!!
We've tried before but it always packed and doesn't take reservations.
The zucchini and mashed potatoes are a blend of garlic and butter which simply melts in your mouth.
The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard.
The wait staff was very attentive and polite.
Try the green curry!!!
but, the filet mignon was not very good at all cocktail hour includes free appetizers (nice non-sushi selection).
The garlic mashed potatoes are hands down the best in the city!
Decor is charming.
The decor is really blah, and not at all hip or happening.
The table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the service industry, I understood they were busy.
Enjoyed a very nice Caesar Salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheese....both very tasty.
That's why you have to pay more for that.
The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).
Likewise if you like really thin crust or really big slices then Nick and Joe's may not be your favorite.
The Pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down, it was a pleasurable experience.
I thought I had died and gone to heaven.
Joya used to be a cool spot with decent food and a colorful - if not relaxed - atmosphere.
great food, lt's of it, more then one person can eat!
" The menu includes pub fare--burgers, steaks and shepherds pie--and even a portabella lasagna for those black sheep known as "vegetarians.
Stuffing yourself with Japanese food is a rare thing.
I would go back tho.
The food is inventive but still keeps traditional indian flavoring.
I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart's for their food, the ambience and wonderful service.
I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart's for their food, the ambience and wonderful service.
Looking around, I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant, not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen.
The food was average to above-average; the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive, and the desserts not brilliant in any way.
You can do it here.
whoever the jazz duo was, they were on POINT.
My husband and I ate here after reading reviews here as well as hobokeni.com,
Especially liked chicken tikka and the naan, and the dals.
Very pleased
I would recommend this place to anyone and would without a doubt come again.
Creative, consistent, fresh.
For the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated.
The fish was adequate, but inexpertly sliced.
This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it.
Five of us walked in at approximately 6:20 on a Thursday evening. 
Raga stands out with an interesting fusion of French and Indian cooking.
The sandwiches are dry, tasteless and way overpriced.
it was really good pizza.
This is the kind of place you'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret.
I loved it and would go again.
The $300 bill was a bit steep, but the experience was great.
Saturday, Nov. 6th I had a group from work come in with about 35 people and the staff was amazing to accomodate us.
A big disappointment, all around.
My personal favorite is Nick and Joe's.
I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE.
We liked it so much, that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York.
However, if you want great food at a great price and don't mind the decor, you can't beat this place.
If you're looking for a place to sit down, have a drink and conversations with friends, go to sweet-n-tart and order yourself a hong-kong styled milk and tea with tapioca pearls (hot).
Service is not exactly five star, but thats not really a big deal.
And everytime I go there's a bunch of drunk idiots making a scene out front.
I would recommend putting your name down and then getting a drink at a local bar first though because of the wait time.
The service was mediocre, and the lack of air conditioning made for a less than comfortable meal.
They do cater to American palates, but if you like it hot let them know and they are more than willing to oblige!
Not only do they have the best escargot in town,they always try to accomodate our toddler.
I have eaten a lot of pizza here.
Ask for the round corner table next to the large window.
Another great place to take out-of-towners!
Expensive
I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken.
Quite frankly, this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried.
I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive.
The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
My order is on my table even on a busy friday night within 10 minutes (at the most) of hanging up the phone.
Been there, done that, and New York, it's not that big a deal.
During the course of the past 3 months, the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better.
All of my co-workers stated that the food was amazing and wondered why they hadn't heard about this place.
The lack of AC and the fact that there are a million swarming bodies (although everyone is polite and no one is pushing) is a slight turn off.
I would go back.
If you like the food and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants, this is not the place for you.
I'm sure I'll return for a final judgement tho.
The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu, present your meal, and attend to your needs.
The chicken pot pie is excpetiona, the cheeseburger huge and delictable, and the service professional wan warm.
I complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted.
Service was good and food is wonderful.
the turkey burgers are scary!
We had a birthday party here recently and the food and service was amazing.
Yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously, but it shouldn't.
Decor is nice though service can be spotty.
And you never get the feeling that you need to leave.
I went here for a family birthday dinner. 
The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion (maybe 3 of each). 
I like Mamoun's food as well, but side by side, Kati Rolls just produce tastier food hands down.
I always find myself asking the waiter to make something bland and different than what is on the menu.
An excellent service
This place is great.
For those that go once and don't enjoy it, all I can say is that they just don't get it.
Service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great.
Bring your date and a bottle of wine!
Have the iced tea.
My friends spoke so much about it for months, I finally made the time to come down ear and dine in.
Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids.
It was well worth the wait.
The service is awful.
I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends, and spent three enjoyable hours there.
Definite go if you're used to good Indian restaurant food from abroad.
The food was bland oily.
Other apetizers and food
Anyway, the owner was fake.
I sometimes see the waiters don't have enough knowledge of their dishes.
I recommend to anyone who wants to dress up and impress the lady.
A gentleman, maybe the manager, came to our table, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order.
We have been to this place many times, and always have great food, wine, and service.
What a great place.
Food is excellent.
The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty.
please don't fool us.
Can't argue about that, but they are clearly over priced.
The sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are innovative and delicious.
It's to die for!
we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant, then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers.
We were exploring Grand Central and didn't want to eat in the food court.
La Rosa waltzes in, and I think they are doing it the best.
The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses!
Got a little loud after 8pm when the joint got full.
And as SOON as one person is done, she asked to pick up the plate immediately.
Been going here since it opened have seen the quality value decrease considerably.
Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months.
I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri.
A nice find in the neighborhood.
Definitely not worth the price!
My friend had a burger and I had these wonderful blueberry pancakes.
The staff is very friendly.
The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly doesn't work.
Go for it!
The food and staff always surprise me with the new heights they are taken to.
I really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi (on saffron risotto-yum!).
She replied "well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now, since you are a larger party, and it might get crowded." 
What makes this restaurant special are the authentic sichuan cooking and being the only one in NYC that offers authentic chongqing hotpot.
This place doesn't make any sense
Lived in Shanghai most of my life and thought the food was comparable to the flagship Green Bo restaurant there.
The chicken lollipop is my favorite, most of the dishes (I have to agree with a previous reviewer) are quite oily and very spicy, espeically the Chilli Chicken.
The first time I went, and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere, I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad.
Fine, I wont hang you for that.
So sorry I can't rate this better.
I love Ess-a-bagel, but I live on the west side, so I often go to Murray's for convenience.
Even my Indian friend couldn't believe how good and tasty everything was.
My family ate here last weekend.
Kosher dills are the perfect compliment for your unforgetable sandwich and they give you plenty of them.
I went to Kitchenette this weekend for brunch.
Food is excellent and they also have empenadas and plaintains which are good for an afternoon snack.
It's better than being on the roof of Sutton Place with 19 year old interns jabbing you in the ribs all night.
Faan is sooo good.
I'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely!
I go here at least once every other week, particularly when it's cold!
I came here for my friend's birthday and keep coming back ever since.
We will be back.
not only is the food
several times and put up with the waiters' bad manners, knowing that their job isn't easy.
since the first time I came here I've been hooked.
I love this cozy around the way Rest.
The staff is arrogant, the prices are way high for Brooklyn.
We come from New Jersey to eat at Kinoko.
They also have a great assortment of wraps if your not in the mood for traditional Mediterranean fare.
They have authentic Indian at amazin prices.
You will not be dissapointed by any of the choices in the menu.
Just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday.
Celebrated my fathers birthday here.
Went to Village last night for my birthday.
Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you.
if this happens, just ask for real naan.
I had Filet Mignon with garlic mash.
The menu prices are a bit expensive for what you get in quality and portion size.
Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $10.
I've had better Japanese food at a mall food court.
There is usually a wait but it is well worth it.
You can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience, but for superb food at reasonable prices, La Villa can't be beat.
If you are looking for a good quality, cheap eats - this is the place.
The highly spiced chai tea was great too.
The atmosphere is nothing special, but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo.
We spent so much time getting elbowed around while we waited we left.
Service is great, takeout is good too.
We always get a sampling of appetizers and share.
We've found it to be better and fresher than Kiku which is comparable in price.
The food was delicious (I had a halibut special, my husband had steak), and the service was top-notch.
We were sorry to check them off our list as we had enjoyed and recommended the place in the past.
We love the food, drinks, and atmosphere!
As many other reviewers noticed, your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time.
The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent.
The waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet, we were told no...
Went for Mom's birthday brunch/lunch.
It's constantly open, catering to the Pakistani cabbies lined up on Crosby St., so there's more turnover with the food than you'd expect (i.e., surprisingly fresh).
Go only if you are already in the neighborhood and don't want to bother going farther for a better place.
I wish I COULD be refunded!
We were seated promptly in close proximity to the dance floor.
Once they ran out of Gnochi and made it for me from scratch!
My co-workers had to wait almost an hour for delivery, only to discover that what they got was not what they ordered.
Just wish they'd expand.
Overall, this is a great new restaurant that has been consistently good every time I have been.
The ambience was so fun, and the prices were great, on top of the fact that the food was really tasty.
As there were so many to choose from we wandered up and down the street looking in the windows and such noticicing many empty seats ,except at Taj Mahal.
Everyone that has ever come here with me has become a convert and returned regularly with their own friends.
I love Indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it.
Great pizza and fantastic service.
I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!
We asked to be moved (which took half an hour), and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back, even though the rest of the room was practically empty.
NO more reservations, expensive tips and annoying stuff.
They were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior.
I CAN EAT HERE EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK REALLY LOL LOVE THIS PLACE ...)
The food was almost always EXCELLENT.
The atmosphere is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon.
I have been in many restaurants all over the city and Roth's Steakhouse has quickly become one of my favorites.
The bread is top notch as well.
The atmosphere was great.
The food arrived 20 minutes after I called, cold and soggy.
The Steak Tartare is a great bet, they fix it for you at the table.
Bobb V's is a great place to take your Friends and Family!
The folding chair I was seated at was uncomfortable.
A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning!
And really large portions.
In mi burrito, here was nothing but dark chicken that had that cooked last week and just warmed up in a microwave taste.
From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I can't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing.
I decided to try out this place after hearing about it in many magazines.
Nice value.
My bf and I go to the walk-up counter and order a pie.
The menu is nothing like the one on the website.
Build a meal with side orders like Amazin' Greens salads, Buffalo Chicken Kickers and Cinna Stix.
The waitress suggested glasses of wine that went very well with the food.
I'm a friendly person, so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal. 
THE FOOD PORTIONS ARE REALLY LARGE.
THE BANANA PUDDING THEY SERVE HAS NEVER SEEN AN OVEN,THE CRABCAKES ARE WAY OVER SALTED AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THE VERY GREASY MAC AND CHEESE.
But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the BTs.
The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless, so was the seafood tagliatelle.
Authentic food and they have REAL service, not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door.
Actually, everyone who worked there seemed to be annoyed.
For starters they delivered us someone else's order.
This place is greatly welcome in the desolate little strip between the Prospect Expressway and Greenwood Cemetery - a wasteland we like to call The Sliv.
We live nearby BFC. 
The atmosphere takes you to that place, the place many dream of.
How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me.
Similar to other Indian restaurants, they use the dinner special to attract customers at the door.
Surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as Kobe.
As many other reviewers noticed, your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time.
Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you're with.
And they have these home made potato chips at the bar that are the most delicious things in the world!
overall, a solid restaurant and at less than $40pp (including wine), a solid deal as well.
It was pretty inexpensive too.
The well mannered, pleasant staff that Tony has in his employ.
The atmosphere was nice but it was a little too dark.
Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most.
The food is above average for midtown and sligtly better than some of the other Heartland Breweries in the city.
Last time I went here, the waitress didn't come back after taking our order.
Polite acknowledgement is out;
The staff is very kind and well trained, they're fast, they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks, they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations.
Thank you everyone at Water's Edge.
When we sat, we got great and fast service.
Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos.
The service is a quite slow, but friendly.
Stick to dimsum, not super overpriced noodles.
We had our Christmas party at Dos Caminos and it was wonderful.
Inside is a little cramped, but to be expected.
Furthermore, the rice had no seasoning, so the sushi was bland and disgusting.
I must give it Yon out of Yon stars!
Decor is nice and minimalist, food simple yet very well presented and cooked, and the wine list matches the food very well.
Hip boutiques and bars on Ludlow add to the artsy, laid-back atmosphere at this Israeli-style takeout and eat-in burger joint.
They outshine HH.
despite the untasteful previous review...
However, once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin.
The high prices you're going to pay is for the view not for the food.
For each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink.
Whenever you need a Sushi fix, Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service.
That is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish, and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste.
The staff has been nice, but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often.
The food options rule.
We had a most unpleasant experience at this restaurant.
The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate.
Great wine selection, Gigondas is worth the price, and the house champagne is a great value.
The palak paneer was standard, and I was not a fan of the malai kofta.
I had very high expectations for this place and made a reservation a couple of months in advance for a special occasion.
Can’t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients.
i don't usually order wine with indian so i can't comment on their wine list or their wines.
A beautiful atmosphere, perfect for drinks and/or appetizers.
Please take my advice, go and try this place.
Of course, it is crowded but who cares.
So eat fast and order a lot.
Everything is always cooked to perfection, the service is excellent, the decor cool and understated.
...and that's saying a lot.
The food's as good as ever.
For authentic Thai food, look no further than Toons.
I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try.
I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently.
I recommend this place to everyone who asks me where to go for a good meal.
However, it was worth the visit.
Terrible Waste of money.. scammers
Good, fast service.
We go often for lunch and the place is packed.
My six year old loved it.
We had crawfish boiled and despite making a mess, it was a ton of fun and quite tasty as well.
And the bill was outragous.
A few tips: skip the turnip cake, roast pork buns and egg custards.
I cannot imagine better Indian food in all of the city.
Bukhara Grill, the tagline says it all.. "INDIAN SPICE RAVE"
When we stumbled on Leon, we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT, we were certainly wrong.
From the beginning, we were met by friendly staff memebers, and the convienent parking at Chelsea Piers made it easy for us to get to the boat.
I'm not even going to bother to describe it; it speaks for itself.
I got the $10 10-piece dim sum combo, every bite of which was great.
It takes forever to get a drink and they almost always forget to bring something (although they dont forget to charge you for it.
Service is fast and friendly.
I ordered a Lassi and asked 4 times for it but never got it.
Just not good at all.
A guaranteeed delight!
I think this is one of the more underrated places in the city.
My girlfiends and I ate at O.G. again last night.
Our waiter was friendly and it is a shame that he didnt have a supportive staff to work with.
My boyfriend ate tuna and it was cooked perfectly!
This is a twenty-something guy that doesn't mind laying down $300 for a fine and delicious meal for 2 on special occassions.
I'm sure I'll return for a final judgement tho.
The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.
Yeah Shanghai is also great but not quite as good -- they use the same amount of salt but without sweetness to balance out.
One of my favorite places in Brooklyn. 
Wine list is not huge but def well selected.
The takeout menu says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more italian dishes, I can't wait!
Also, the place is popular with families, so if you're bothered by children running loose like wild animals, come later at night to avoid them.
This place is worth an one-hour drive.
If I could rate the people this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza, sorry - not the best in NYC.
We'd go back again
This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls.
You feel like you made it to New York when you eat here.
Unbelievable.
Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth.
Not only was the food outstanding, but the little 'perks' were great.
I will definetly be going back.
The service is a bit slow, but harkens back to my years growing up in Napoli, Italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night.
The food is good.
Also, the chick peas with shrimp (appetizer) is divine.
Went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and appetizers.
It hits the spot every time
Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi, which is great , the thai food is excellent too .
The staff is unbelievably friendly, and I dream about their Saag gosht...so good.
I found it on a cold night, the perfect spot to warm up.
Waitstaff are very friendly.
Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end, not one person takes responsibility for anything.
It's about $7 for lunch and they have take-out or dine-in.
So what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food.
Chennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city.
The dinner menu is diverse and top-notch as well.
short and sweet – seating is great:it's romantic,cozy and private.
It doesn't look appetizing as it's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black, but the taste was phenomenal.
Good, dark atmosphere and the music is a nice touch.
Quality of food is excellent and price is cheap, stick to pork, fish, chicken, lamb and vegetables.
Service was devine, oysters where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat!!!
The Pad thai, lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but, I've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places.
This place is a great stop for great food.
Good for casual dinner with jeans and sneakers.
Late nite omelletes are not good here, there is no variety!
What's the difference between the two?
Why?
Joe's Pizza used to have the best slice until this pizzeria opened up.
I've had better chicken at BBQs!!!!
try the spicy shrimp appetizer (again, not the greatest value in the world but worth the price) and the lamb vindaloo is great.
Walk-ins are risky too.
The restaurant is rather small but we were lucky to get a table quickly.
I've always been seated propmtly.
They kindly brought us more to see if it was better, but it was not!
But for the Shabu Shabu, you won't find much better in NY.
The menu consisted of standard brassiere food, better then places like Balthazar etc.
In the end you end up with a fair tab and NOTHING BUT A GREAT TIME!!!
Definately check it out!!!
Try the spicy wontons and the salt pepper shrimps.
Moderate prices.
They're rude at times, and not very friendly.
I've never been treated so rudely.
oh speaking of bathroom , the mens bathroom was disgusting.
The food is very good and the service is great.
Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable.
I almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded.
As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!
Even my Indian friend couldn't believe how good and tasty everything was.
Diner food at bistro prices is a bummer....
Then, get ripped on free box wine.
Personally I like the margherita pizza better, but they are all good.
I liked the food at this quasi-thai restaurant.
The space kind of feels like an Alice in Wonderland setting, without it trying to be that.
The rolls are creative and I have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious japanese food.
one of the best Chicken Tikka Masala.
i recommend the thai popcorn :)
Go here.
I often go there to eat with my family.
(The sashimi is cut a little thinly.
Service was devine, oysters where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat!!!
The have a great cocktail with Citrus Vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that is to die for!
This place is always very crowded and popular.
The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great.
Great place, great value.
In summer-eat outside on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!
Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most.
If celebrities make you sweat, then your in for a ride, but if your like most around these parts then you'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype.
Service was quick.
So, I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it.
Food is usually very good, though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders.
All are GREAT - poori, naan, paratha all FRESH.
Furthermore, the rice had no seasoning, so the sushi was bland and disgusting.
We all ate pasta entre'es, which were great.
Wonderful at holiday time.
Raymond the bartender rocks!
This is the Cheers of New York, whether you've ever been there or not.
We went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different.
For $760 for 2 people, it's a once in a lifetime experience.
The sauce is delicious and the crust is perfect.
Molto bene!
She just nodded and walked off.
Frankly, when you compare what you can have here for lunch, versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city, there is no comparison.
This place, which is only a few months old, is perhaps Queens' biggest secret!
For someone who used to hate Indian food, Baluchi's has changed my mid.
The traditional Italian items are great - cheap and served in a cozy setting.
I have been urged by friends for months to check out the mermaid inn.
We didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem.
The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree.
Mazing interior.
I LOVE their Thai
While they keep the capex to a minimum, they do put some cash into the bagels, because they among the best in the city.
Chance is a joke.
The staff is courteous and friendly.
An unpretentious spot in Park Slope, the sushi is consistently good, the service is pleasant, effective and unassuming.
Quick and friendly service.
by dinner time, they turn it around and mount a huge comeback!!
You can't go wrong with this place.
The main entree was also very good.
The rice to fish ration was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice.
Finally a curry that I can eat, enjoy and not suffer from gastritis from 3 hours later.
Great restaurant, and even greater food!
I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side.
I have been to Rao's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better.
When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets, and then ordered for them.
They are located off the beaten path but are certainly worth the trip.
This made it obvious that the food wasn't cooked fresh; it was obviously made before hand and then reheated.
It took about 2 1/2 hours to be served our 2 courses.
What generous portions!
I recommend ordering in on a weeknight.
No dress codes, no attitudes, plenty of comfort companionship, a great place to relax in an always busy Midtown.
Reasonable prices.
Be sure to try the seasonal, and always delicious, specials.
Not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring.
I have been to spice three times- twice during lunch and once at dinner.
The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale.
The dish had like 6 pieces of beef in it.
All the NYU students love this place so it makes for a fun young atmosphere.
Paul, the maitre d', was totally professional and always on top of things.
As we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were.
Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went.
We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great!
From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff, I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it.
I can't stand this dungeon.
Somewhat pricey but what the heck.
I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks!
The decor is night tho...but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling...its quite un-appetizing, and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern.
The food however, is what one might expect.
I am a die hard peep lover.
Save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one!
If you're in the neighborhood, definitely stop by for a great meal.
I've been here a couple of times and have not been impressed.
The fish was really,really fresh.
The service was excellent and the food was delicious.
We won't go to this place again for a good meal.
Ask for Usha, the nicest bartender in manhattan.
Intimate but charming interior with extremely friendly and attentive service.
Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll.
It's true, you feel like your in a scene from Goodfellas.
The pizza here is delicious.
Maybe tomorrow ;-)
for about eleven bucks you get a gigantic burrito (or tacos), margarita, and dessert.
The unattractive lighting made me want to gag, the food was overpriced, there was the most awful disco pop duo performing-and my escargot looked like it might crawl off the plate.
Not only would I not recommend Jimmy's restaurants to friends, I would strongly suggest they go anywhere but.
Visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews.
Ambience is so cute and quaint, good for business although we were there on vacation.
The Singapore Mai Fun had NO curry flavor whatsoever.
This place is cool enough to be in the East Village, but French enough to make you feel like you could be in a bistro in a back alley in Paris.
A real dissapointment.
Here you get the zen feel without feeling rigid.
Reasonably priced with very fresh sushi.
Also, waiters try to push more food on you, like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $.
I am completely hooked on this place, it is ridiculous.
Just moved to the neighborhood and we've been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants.
It is expensive but well worth the money.
If you want to save some money, don't go here.
The one positive thing I can say is that the service was prompt, we got seated right away and the server was very friendly.
Katz's deli is a great NY experience.
The seafood is amazing, there's a good wine list, and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises.
This is where it really really gets bad: the manager said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I cannot comp it.
He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine.
Love YUKA.
Ambience is delightful, service impeccable.
THe perfect spot.
The wait staff is very freindly, they make it feel like you're eating in a freindly little european town.
The service is descent even when this small place is packed.
Service was wonderful;
Our waiter was fine, the place looks nice in that not-trying-too-hard way, but at those prices, a little more should be expected of your food.
This restaurant was way overhyped.
Simple healthy unglamorous food cheap.
The space is nice but when we order our drink we were in for a surprise.
This little place is wonderfully warm welcoming.
Here's the thing, you're in the best city in the world for restaurants.
Huge portions, great and attentive service, and pretty good prices.
Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience.
It is kinda nosiy and the tables are close together but it's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner.
I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others.
never swaying, never a bad meal, never bad service...
The menu consisted of standard brassiere food, better then places like Balthazar etc.
And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic.
We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu.
I will recommend Scopa to all of my friends for a place to go for wonderful Italian food.
If you're looking for a great meal at a decent price, go to Del Frisco's!
I've had pizza both times and the caprese salad appetizer.
It is also extremely well priced.
The food is great and reasonably priced.
We were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks.
I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!
Too bad, has a lot of potential.
This place has the best Indian food in New York, hands down.
No refills on fountain drinks, though.
The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out.
and never strayed.
Our teenage kids love it, too.
The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate.
the food is delicious and highly recommended.
The staff was knowledgeable and full of personality.
My wife and I always enjoy the young, not always well trained but nevertheless friendly, staff, all of whom have a story.
We were pleasantly surprised.
I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff.
Very "normal Indian food", but done really well.
I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant, and the food was majorly disappointing.
The sushi is also great!
Her review is above.
Pizza and garlic knots are great as well, I order from them quite often and the delivery is always super quick!
We been there and we really enjoy the food, was areally great food, and the service was really good.
Great Indian Food!
We actually gave 10% tip (which we have never done despite mediocre food and service), because we felt totally ripped off.
We went to Ino for Valentines.
Disappointing food, lousy service.
If presentation and service is your thing, then this magic show works.
It's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street.
i've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine, if not good.
Everyone is welcomed in as family.
It was delish and I didn't feel bad eating it.
Delish and made to your liking!
I've been to several places for Dim Sum and this has got to be the WORST.
it's delicious!
The main draw of this place is the price.
But the thai is definitely not great -- bland and indistinguished.
We arrived for dinner expecting to be impressed by a place that has an impressive past - but, that's just it -- the PAST!
The boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they're perfect for 2 people.
The food was ok and fair nothing to go crazy.
My girlfriend convinced me to go in the other night for a quick bite.
Make sure you try this place as often as you can.
A touch more jalapeno heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed.
They are located in the middle of Chinatown!
Despite a slightly limited menu, everything prepared is done to perfection, ultra fresh and a work of food art.
It's the perfect restaurant for NY life style, it got cool design, awsome drinks and food and lot's of good looking people eating and hanging at the pink bar...
By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant.
The bar drinks were Eh, ok to say the least.
Three page wine menu, one page entree and horedevous.
When he finally did, he was unable to make a gin and tonic -- couldn't find tonic.
I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere!
My daughter and I left feeling satisfied (not stuffed) and it felt good to know we had a healthy lunch.
This is a consistently great place to dine for lunch or dinner.
I will NEVER return.
I was wrong.
The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices.
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place.
This place has the best interior I have seen anywhere in the northside of W'burg, and will impress whoever you bring there.
This is a fun restaurant to go to.
The bagels always warm, soft on the inside, crispy on the outside and enormous in size.
If you live in new york city, you'll find better food at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount.
I have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused, and wasted my hard earned money.
Stay away if you're claustrophobic
Arigato Gozimas Yuka!
The gnocchi literally melts in your mouth!
I'm glad I did as the food was very good and the staff was friendly, courteous and efficient.
It is bland and nothing extrodinary.
Service was good and so was the atmosphere.
Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening.
I think the restaurant was too loud (when full) to be romantic.
We live in the neighborhood and have been going there twice a week since the day they first opened.
wow! how have i missed this one ,tried Long Tan last week for the first time and now know what the NY TIMES and many more in the neighborhood already knew.
Bagels are ok, but be sure not to make any special requests!
I love the atmorphere @ peep!
Save room for deserts - they're to die for.
Hands down the best pizza on the planet.
My wife I lived on the west side and found this while visiting firends on the UES.
the atmosphere is very nice, and a welcome escape from the rest of the SI mall.
Guaranteed to be a tasty experience!)
Kudos Haru
The menu has lots of options: I hope to go back to try those potato pancakes.
I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna.
The blond wood decor is very soothing, the premium sake is excellent and the service is great.
The waiter was attentive, the food was delicious and the views of the city were great.
The service was quick and friendly.
They don't concern much of customer's health, just want to make money.
The food was pretty good, but a little flavorless and the portions very small, including dessert.
What's the difference between the two?
You can't go wrong with this place.
On the recommendation of a friend, I checked out Arezzo with my wife.
If you're in the 'hood, definitely stop in.
We were greeted promptly by the waiter who was very nice and cordial.
I'm going back.
I would highly recommend.
I would highly recommend this place!
I come here enjoy very much with husband.
Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table.
The lox is always fresh too.
We had the pot-stickers which were great and a tempura dish that was great.
I have been going back again and again.
It's boring on the inside, and our sushi was pretty below average... the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor.
I go out to eat and like my courses, servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink.
It is quite a spectacular scene i'll give them that.
They never came back to refill our glasses again.
good variety but nothing surprising.
I recommend any of their salmon dishes......
Service was very good - prompt, attentive and non-intrusive.
Went there for an office lunch.
I don't live in NY but my best friend does.
Would you ever believe that when you complain about over an hour wait, when they tell you it will be 20-30 minutes, the manager tells the bartender to spill the drinks you just paid for?
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere.
The pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere.
I've been to Joya twice and I will never go again.
My fiance and I recently wanted to see the city and deceided to take a dinner cruise.
We ordered lamb which was perfectly cooked and tasted awesome.
The Thali was small, thoroughly unremarkable, and $14.95.
Everything about this place is adorable - even the bathroom!
I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree, which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better.
Over time, the food quality has decreased substantially, it is a lot less crowded than it used to, and the service must definitely be part of the reason.
Highly Highly Highly recommended!
We were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem.
Service- friendly and attentive.
There was only one waiter for the whole restaurant upstairs.
Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat.
I must give it Yon out of Yon stars!
But regulars know that the sandwiches are the real star here.
I didn't complain, I liked the atmosphere so much.
Loved It
The wine list is excellent.
It's a nice place to relax and have conversation.
A very inviting restaurant, with friendly service.
The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals.
Great bar, most gorgeous bartenders you've ever seen (specifically the blond lady).
The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world.
So for a filling and healthy meal give it a go.
I pray it stays open forever.
A one women show!
Its also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car (I happen to live in Inwood).
They all know you.
I also ordered the Change Mojito, which was out of this world.
The Bagels have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture, both chewy yet not gummy.
BE CAREFUL before you request extra spice.
I have eaten here several times before attending an afternoon performance.
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny.
Great sushi experience.
The food's as good as ever.
Don't judge this place prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart.
Great Indian food
I really loved the different and inovated touch that's the cheff gives to the food.
The strong scents coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds.
In terms of the food itself -- nothing special, we limited ourselves to several appetizers.
Planet Thai is great!
Prices even outside of restaurant week were great.
Always great service!
For all you lazy folks that don't want to come to Alphabet City, I say, good - stay out.
The cold sesame noodles, which are a freebie when you order $10+, are delectable.
Service not the friendliest to our "large party"! 
Nha Trang, while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor, horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals, is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been to. the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables.
I love this place.
If you want good tasting, well seasoned latin food eat at Cabana and you can't go wrong.
Being a vegan myself, I've made a point of trying all the vegan restaurants in Manhattan--and Zen Palate is easily my favorite.
I highly recommend the Sophia pizza.
Food was okay, nothing great.
I really liked the noodle dishes at Rice Avenue compared to their Green Curry dish.
The cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan.
We were told that they were booked solid and no other table was available.
We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it.
We called the other person who was very close by, and she told us to order for her, so we did. 
We'll definitly be back again!
We walked in on a Wednesday night and were seated promptly.
Staff is accomodating make sure you are satified.
Great pizza for lunch place.
if your into thai..you cannot miss this great restaurant.
I stumbled upon this resteraunt on my way home from the subway.
The staff is no nonsense.
Drinks way over priced.
The bagels always warm, soft on the inside, crispy on the outside and enormous in size.
Only suggestion is that you skip the dessert, it was overpriced and fell short on taste.
the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside.
This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets, with that certain Parisian flair.
Avoid at all costs.
After reading the good reviews of this restaurant, I decided to give it a try with two friends.
The fried dumplings are GREAT!
Took my sister here before attending a show one evening.
The place is a lot of fun.
The dishes offered were unique, very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages, sardines with biscuits, large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream (the best and freshest I've ever had).
When the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing.
We all had the tasting menu and unlike some of the other reviews, I felt there was more than enough food.
You won't be dissapointed.
Unique apppetizers.
They charge different prices all the time.
The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome, great appetizer to share!
We were worried we would have trouble getting in, but somehow managed to have a short wait.
We were 10 people celebrtating a birthday, we sat in the tent.
The food was good, the service prompt, and the price very reasonable. 
Rao's has the best service and atmosphere in NYC.
Although the restaurant itself is nice, I prefer not to go for the food.
And cheap!
It's really also the service, is good and the waiters are friendly.
Bleecker St Pizza is the best!
Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that.
Nevertheless the food itself is pretty good.
The family seafood entree was very good.
It is sometimes a little cramped, and can get a little warm, but hello, it's NYC!
We ate outside at Haru's Sake bar because Haru's restaurant next door was overflowing.
The wine list is extensive and impressive.
The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had (I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat).
Service is top notch.
The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared.
By the time we were done, it was past 1:00am.
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, two types of sake, and the banana tempura.
Not the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant.
When we were finally seated our waitress came by twice-1 for our order and 2-for our check.
Great bagels, spreads and a good place to hang out in.
When we stumbled on Leon, we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT, we were certainly wrong.
It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips.
Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon, which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave.
I absolutely love this place!!!
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible.
These are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner:
Despite a slightly limited menu, everything prepared is done to perfection, ultra fresh and a work of food art.
They are often crowded on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their service.
The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic.
Our first time in New York and we had to try a New York Bagel.
Not cheap but very yummy.
The only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting, the additional menu items are only written in Chinese.
NO PIZZA 33 for me!
The Dim Sum was so-so, but not spectacular.
it is a cozy place to go with a couple of friends.
Subtle food and service
I can't believe people complain about no cheese sticks?
What is even better, is that the prices are very affordable as well, and the food is really good.
They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies.
I also ordered for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the order.
This place has many different styles of pizza and they are all amazing.
Try it side by side and there's no comparison.
however, it's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
Should you happen to be impressed by the cuisine definitely try it.
Not sure where the previous reviewer, lonk, dined, but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food!
We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods.
No plans to return anytime soon.
It can be a little confusing as to where one goes to order, but once the food is ordered, you are in for a treat.
They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends.
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently.
I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic, alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods, the tastes, the experiance.
SUM IT: local investment bankers like it, try for yourself at least once.
A Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner?
They might be all business at the counter when you give your order, but their food says I love you.
After hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant, and passing by it on a daily basis, we decided to try.
Always busy but fast moving.
Too cold to enjoy.
It had been awhile and I forgot just how delicious crepes can be.
The waitresses are nice--also you can just get counter service sit.
Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away.
Worth a visit.
those rolls were big, but not good and sashimi wasn't fresh.
We ordered our appetizers, I ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon.
I was pretty much full after our fondue appetizer.
Generously garnished, organic grilled burgers are the most popular dish, but the Jerusalem market-style falafel wraps and Mediterranean salads--layered with beets, goat cheese and walnuts--are equally scrumptious.
Fast service.
Try sushimi cucumber roll.
The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food.
you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review.
This place was not ALL THAT!
The food was great and the service was even better.
However, there is just something so great about being outdoors, in great landscaping, enjoying a casual drink that makes going to this place worthwhile.
By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers!
The menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent.
When I called this morning, I didn't think I would be able to get in at 12, but I was able to get in, along with four other guests.
The pizza was pretty good and huge.
I am happy i did the food was awsome.
If your visiting, you'll enjoy the ambiance and the fact that it's in Time Sq...
It's popular w/the late crowd.
The sandwiches are dry, tasteless and way overpriced.
Look, the appetizers were really good.
The level of rudeness was preposterous.
You'll see a lot of people eating there after church.
The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary.
Suan has challenged this loyalty.
just got back from lunch at Tamarind and it was excellent.
They don't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai.
The food now is inconsistent.
Anyways, if you're in the neighborhood to eat good food, I wouldn't waste my time trying to find something, rather go across the street to Tamari.
While it was large and a bit noisy, the drinks were fantastic, and the food was superb.
The service was excellent and the food was delicious.
Good luck getting a table.
Food is excellent.
Their eggplant is so delicate, sweet tender!
Food was very good, but not what I would consider out of this world.
At this point, the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress WALKED away.
Overall, excellent restaurant!
Great bagels, spreads and a good place to hang out in.
Our friends have not arrived yet.
I was starving and the small portions were driving me crazy!
Service is average.
Even upon delivery, their juicy pork buns are quite good . .
--Eat Club is a roving group of NYC gluttons
I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere that whisks you away to the left bank of the river Seine.
I know real Indian food and this wasn't it.
The atmosphere is much better than Sripraphai (more modern and sleek).
They offer the same menu but have creative drinks that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names -- but they do cost you.
DO not try unless you're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste.
Always a nice crowd, but never loud.
I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fine Indian dining experience that is definitely a value for your dollar.
Great find!!!
I've been to this restaurant more than a dozen times and when I'm craving for Pho, Lemon grass chicken or Beef Cube on rice, this is the place to go.
Be prepared to wait, because the place is pretty tiny.
You can get a table without a reservation if you get there early I they don't make you by bottles.
The red curry is weak and tasteless, the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy, the rice is often overcooked, and the seafood is pretty sketchy.
esp. during happy hour!
The lamb was tender so full of flavor, the dessert was divine!!
I have never eaten in the restaurant, however, upon reading the reviews I got take out last week.
The service was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served.
The place is a little tight and on a cold day, the seating by the entranceway can be pretty drafty.
That said, I thought Scalini Fedeli was one of the best dining experiences I've EVER had.
Be careful of portions - they're HUGE.
They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another.
The service was the only thing good about this restaurant.
It's the conversations that make this a fun place to be.
I love it.
If we were to move from the upper east side, we would genuinely miss this restaurant.
I live nearby and when they first opened, I ate there a lot.
One of my favorite places in Manhattan.
Veal Parmigana - Better than Patsy's!
The Management was less than accomodating.
Stay away from the latter since you won't go for seconds (hint hint).
Definitely not a restaurant to skip!
This is some really good, inexpensive sushi.
The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale.
For sure i will keep coming back because i feel really this restaurant deserves.
The crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly.
I really recommend the very simple Unda (Egg) rolls.
Great wine selection, Gigondas is worth the price, and the house champagne is a great value.
I definitely enjoyed the food as well.
There is a downside if you're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude.
I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
Don't waste your time or your money.
Kind, attentive wait staff.
Great food, good wine and an excellent host.
Based on the reviews on here, it appears that the restaurant is overwhelmed after the 7 PM.
Glad you have the luxury to throw out paying customers.
And the food, well the food will keep you coming back.
I would not recommend MEET at all, it is a rip off all the way from the time to step in!
A restaurant that doesn't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere.
Having moved I truly miss this place.
This big draw is the all you can sushi here for $19.95!
My husband and I have been there at least 6 times and we've always been given the highest service and often free desserts.
This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money.
My wife and I visited Dokebi tonight.
The pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC.
They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great.
When I called this morning, I didn't think I would be able to get in at 12, but I was able to get in, along with four other guests.
If you are someone who appreciates simplicity, elegance, and wonderfully presented and tasting seafood and vegetables regardless of portion size, Kai is your place.
Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh, a delicious and sweet tasting bread.
The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it.
It was good, but was not what I thought it would be.
I highly recommend the Sophia pizza.
(Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer!!!
Service was very good and warm.
Obviously run by folks who know a pie.
They showed up 15 minutes after the tuna melt.
As for the bar, this is another bad idea.
Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey.
Cool atmosphere but such a let down.
What a pleasant surprise!
Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet.
Since my first dinner I have had the chance to have brunch at Orsay 3x.
There was a small group of us looking somewhere to eat kinda late on a weeknight and we ended up at Pastis.
I have been going there since it opened and I can't get enough.
The music does get a little loud at times, but it just made me want to lean closer to my beautiful wife, and as I did, I got a whiff of corriander.
Everything was going good until we got our meals.
Best Taiwanese food in NY!
Overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites, but everything was delicious.
While I quite liked the food and the ambience, I'm not quite sure if it they really deserve it the Michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window.
I will definetly be going back.
The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance.
Yes, the prices are high, but I felt it was worth it.
This restaurant is not worth the time, effort, or money to say the least.
You will pay a lot for the decore, but the food is no better or worse than a lot of other Chinese and Asian fusion places in NY.
I was very impressed by this low-key upper eastsider and their authentically thai cuisine!!!
To the owners; good job guys, this place is a keeper!
Maybe it has improved since then?
I have been to Roth's twice and both times were very disappointing.
What came to our table was burned beyond recognition and stringy.
Aside from the Sea Urchin, the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail, Boton Shrimp, Blue Fin Torro (Fatty Tuna), Sea Eel, etc.
Ruth, mother of the Bride
Priced at upper intermediate range.
Our favorite meal is a pesto pizza, the house salad, and a good bottle of wine.
Drinks: 2 glasses of Dom Perignon at $35 each.
This is a fun restaurant to go to.
Would NEVER go back
Food is great.
The staff is incredibly helpful and attentive.
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category.
The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches.
Don't waste money on decor.
I live in the neightborhood and am a regular.
I was pleasantly suprised.
The chicken pot pie is excpetiona, the cheeseburger huge and delictable, and the service professional wan warm.
not the food ,not the ambiance , not the service, I agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait , the wait staff are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out .
There are no negatives to speak of.
Cute and decorative.
SO SO SO SO SO good!
I have been going to this restaurant for years, in the past the service was average and the food inconsistant.
I've been here 3 times for lunch and it is one of my favorites in the city.
He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine.
Right off the major deegan you get ladies from all over the city.
Cantinetta is a real treasure in a see of mediocre Italian restaurants.
Even though its good seafood, the prices are too high.
Its a nice quiet location to go eat a good meal, relax, be able to talk and have a very good time.
I brought some buddies from CA and they loved it.
We had half/half pizza, mine was eggplant and my friend had the buffalo and it was sooo huge for a small size pizza!
You order from a menu, so you leave feeling like you missed the full experience.
Everything is for sale in here including the sculptured iron statue on the table.
Very cozy and warm inside.....
Good food at the right price, what more can you ask for.
Had 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the bill was ~$55.00, not including tip.
This time, I prefer not to go into detail.
Awsome Pizza especially the Margheritta slice.
A mix of students and area residents crowd into this narrow, barely there space for its quick, tasty treats at dirt-cheap prices.
I've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times, but more often I order delivery.
The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates.
Nick Stef's is one of the only places worthy of going in the area, so if you happen to be by Madison Square Garden or Herald's Square check it out!
It costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice.
Service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great.
I really liked this place.
THE SERVICE IS AMAZING, i've had different waiters and they were all nice, which is a rare thing in NYC.
(that is A MUST, but not every restaurant can do...) 
We weren't!
Everything we had was good or ok....but definitely nothing great.
The waitress, seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing.
bottles of wine are cheap and good.
good food good wine that's it.
My girlfriend and I just spent our 10 month anniversary at Lou Lou.
Some baby pizzas get their wish.
The service was typical short-order, dinner type.
A beautifully designed dreamy Egyptian restaurant that gets sceney at night.
Rude service, medicore food...there are tons of restaurants in NY...stay away from this one
I thought this place was totally overrated.
However, it is jus too good to not praise it.
I choose to go with one of the special, the braised lamb shank in red wine, which was excellent.
We have been to this place many times, and always have great food, wine, and service.
strike up a conversation with the attorney next to you, or with the local union worker on the other side.
Indoor was very cozy and cute.
Not to be overlooked, the service is excellent.
The wine list was superb, our tapas delightful, and the quiet atmosphere perfect for good conversation.
The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.
I lived in Maine for ten years and grew up on fish.
Not what I wanted to hear.
My first encounter happened one friday evening with a friend.
It's cuz it's so good you need to taste it!!! 
This place doesn't get the publicity that Sylvias Soul Food restaurant does, but it should.
So we sat at the bar, the bartender didn't seem like he wanted to be there.
It gets crowded at lunchtime but there are lots of seats in back and everyone who works there is so nice.
The food was just OK, I would never go back.
i especially like their soft shell crab sandwich with fries.
Our last time there a few weeks ago was early at 5pm and it was very crowded and noisy.
Get the soup and a nosh (pastrami sandwich) for $8 and you're golden.
Interesting other dishes for a change include chicken in curry sauce and salmon caserole.
I have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.
Great food and the prices are very reasonable.
You could get a much better dining experience for the same amount of money in a lot of other French Bistros.
The photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real look.
For many people, this may not seem like Aunthentic Thai food because most places in NYC arent quite authentic.
The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive.
Not pretentious and very economical.
This is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood.
How pretentious and inappropriate for MJ Grill to claim that it provides power lunch and dinners!
She was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about Indian food.
Moving on.
The ambience is very calm and quiet.
Our server was very helpful and friendly.
I would definitely come back to this restaurant.
I went for restaurant week.
I was there on sat. for my birthday and we had an excellent time.
Forget the rush and the wait and the noise (which isn't actually that bad), I mean please, who goes to a steakhouse to be coddled and romantic?
Food is great.
I never write on these sites but this restaurant is def worth commending!
The prices are wonderfully low.
But I just would like to say I read the reviews people left and thats why I checked it out.
It is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no traffic noise.
The food was excellent as well as service, however, I left The Four Seasons very dissappointed.
A narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters, a great deal of mess (stacks of bottles, cans) and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees.
The wine list is extensive, well priced and covers alot of regions.
Which lets face it....at times it's a good thing.
The stuff tilapia was horrid...tasted like cardboard.
And where does Patis go wrong; no where. 
Going to Ballato's is like coming home and eating in my own kitchen, an absolute delight!
After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner.
The portion sizes here are huge, and the sushi is good.
I had been a regular due to the consistently good food and ease of getting a table.
The atmosphere was mostly of an older crowd, but there were a few groups of mid 20's/30 year olds also.
The food was absolutely horrible!
Well worth the trip, close to City Hall and downtown subway stops.
I had a great experience.
Too bad Latin Quarters closed.
The menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked.
The Italian food has flavor (that can be sort of surprising on the UES), and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive,they sort of remind me of the NY Yankees of the late 90's, no matter how bad it look, you knew that there was a rally just around the corner...
Young neighborhood trendies graze at the counter during the day, while chic, art-house drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night.
While I'm not sure that this happens all the time-this is the kind of treatment that buys repeat business!
In fact, it appears he is going to go postal at any moment.
The quality of the meat was on par with your local grocery store.
I'm saving up for my next visit.
It was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes.
The decoration was feeling like we was on the Cairo, actually the street is part of that adventure.
If you want Americanized Chinese food with your usual watery, generic white sauce, this is your place.
Big and gawky on the outside.
To begin, we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave, when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready.
Sweet Irish bartender is always happy and able to bring a smile to my friends a my face.
Just go in and sample the greatest french food west of Daniel.
The waiter was attentive.
None was made so i hung up.
I have never been so disgusted by both food an service.
The service is fine and they allow you to enjoy the view.
The owner is very friendly and a great guy, go try his pizza, you'll like it!
Have recommended the place to friends, always gets good response.
Food was OK.
Delicious crab cakes too.
The first time the sushi was outstanding, the second time it was a little bland.
We didn't get drink refills and she didn't even offer us the option of dessert.
The food was excellent - authentic Italian cuisine made absolutely fresh.
It may be a bit packed on weekends, but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area.
I think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation.
Metrazur has a beautiful spot overlooking the main terminal.
Try the ribs, sizzling beef and couple it with coconut rice.
However, our main course was wonderful.
There was no ambiance.
The sushi is average and the prices are anything but.
Has the warmth of a family local yet it is a great place to watch sporting events.
Try it!
I love the place.
Service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded.
Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service, which was boarderline rude.
The omlette for brunch is great...
We were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks.
Not enough wines by the glass either.
In China the phrase for a good restaurant is hot and loud.
Give it a try and enjoy.
I believe there were 2 shrimp in the "salt encrusted shrimp" appetizer. 
Okay-i don't mind the oily part (cause most are cooked that way) but it was way too bland.
I ate clams oreganta and spectacular salad with perfectly marinated cucumbers and tomatoes with lots of shrimp and basil.
This is some really good, inexpensive sushi.
Good French restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you're into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at Katz' Deli, or Mexican food which is supplied by capable restaurants.
You are paying for the atmosphere, which is nice, but can be had in numerous places in Bay Ridge.
It's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early.
Nice for one time special occasion.
Something about them being busy with holiday party's.
The location and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it.
Could be pricey without a prix fixe meal.
Be sure to accompany your food with one of their fresh juice concoctions.
THE BEST PLACE TO BRING KIDS OR ANY FRIENDS WHO WANT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes.
I have eaten at Saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good.
Much more reasonably priced too!
Have frequented 'ino for several years and the food remains excellent.
Their sake list was extensive, but we were looking for Purple Haze, which wasn't listed but made for us upon request!
I have tried literally every restaurant on curry row.
Having hunted around for a quiet, romantic, yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot.
It is a small restuarant so go early and it will be nice and quiet- go late and it will be packed!
P.S. Please don't tell anyone in my family i eat there.
The dosas are skimpy, unattractive and drip with grease, and personally I'd drink popcorn topping before I'd eat another one of these.
The large selection of bruschettas, paninis, tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating.
The price is reasonable although the service is poor.
Service here was great, food was fantastic.
Top spot in town for Vietnamese classics, better than places that cost a lot more.
THe back garden sitting area is very pleasant, where you can see their personal herb garden.
The place is beautiful!
The only fallback on this restaurant is the prices.
For dinner I had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan.
We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful.
On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch.
The place is a lot of fun.
The eggplant parmesan is also great, and my friend who grew up in Manhattan claims that no one serves a better baked ziti with meatsauce.
I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED!
Next time, we wouldn't dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks.
I think the stuff was better than Disney.
To finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have dessert, especially the White Chocolate Bread Pudding with Gelato and hot chocolate.
We had a wonderful meal at Naples 45 a month ago on a visit to NYC.
it's the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food.
The food is great (big selection, reasonable prices) and the drinks are really good.
Go with the specials, and stay away from the salmon. 
great hot dogs..
Conveniently located too, being right on Bedford ave.
Oh and it's too tiny for families with strollers.
Their whitefish salad is excellent--all whitefish with a little mayo.
Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit.
Best of all is the warm vibe, the owner is super friendly and service is fast.
A must try!
Anyhow, we were able to sit as long as we wanted and chat, which was nice.
Everything is excellent, the menu is quite extensive, and you eat with a view on both sides of the city.
Please be aware that it's CASH or AMEX only!
The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach.
The entree was bland and small, dessert was not inspired.
Odd for Ave B, not just odd, The place attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least.
Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store.
You will not be missing anything.
It's charmingly small and that leads to an atmoshere that is extremely cozy and romantic, even.
Good drink.
too large for just two people but nothing was left.
and the owner is simply lovely and friendly.
I look forward to eating here again
Drinks got screwed up, she acted put upon.
On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch.
Loved it!
I've lived in NY for 5 years and this place has it all.
it's good but, like the movie is never as good as the book, this is same analogy.
The Steak Tartare is a great bet, they fix it for you at the table.
I read about this place in Time Out magazine.
Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at ALL COST!
This is one of our all-time favorite.
It's all about the food !!
It's true, this place is not cheap.
The worst though was the taste.
It's a nice place to relax and have conversation.
I was so sad to read the bad reviews this place got!
Everyone treats you like you were part of the family.
Food was average and creme brulee was awful - the sugar was charred, not caramelized and smelled of kerosene.
Perhaps.
I am going to the mid town location next.
Gigino's in Wagner Park is so enjoyable.
i've been back to nha trang literally a hundred times for the beef cubes - they're that good.
Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon, Sea Bass and Crispy Duck.
Food is average, and I would say even the chain restaurant Baluchi's tastes better.
I grew up on these bagels.
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money.
I went to Ruby Foo's after work with a group of 6.
We have tried every Thai restaurant between Atlantic Avenue and 4th Streets, and Joya is the best.
It's usually packed for good reason, esp.
I had the black cod with yuzu sauce, which was wonderful.
Food is always fresh and hot- ready to eat!
If you are here as a pre-show meal, hop in a cab and take the extra 10 minutes to go to the uptown location.
The food is definitely good, but I left a bit disappointed.
Ok, for all of us growing up in the Village of NYC, we have spoiled by a plethora of restaurants, most of which stay open very late.
The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing!
The bill is approximately $25 for 2 at lunch without drinks.
I've had to wait only a few times during lunch but this place is definitely worth the wait.
I went at 6:00 PM specifically for the pre-theater menu ($19.95 for roasted tomato soup with chevre, steak frites, creme brulee) and it was marvelous.
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices.
The food is amazing, rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza.
The fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef (usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt).
The steak was very fatty and the sauce was overpowering and not very tasty.
The decor is very simple but comfortable.
They specialize in smoothies and fresh juices.
If we were to move from the upper east side, we would genuinely miss this restaurant.
Just stick with the small dishes!
All in all, this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city.
Open late (well as late as I ever got there and I'm a night person)
Myagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the City; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else.
The food options rule.
Overall, this is a nice place to take a few friends to hang out at and the service is excellent.
The staff is incredibly helpful and attentive.
If you are going for the food, it will not be worth it.
I have to say that I am pleasantly suprised and I will most likely stop in again if I am in the neighborhood.
In Short The Black Sheep distinguishes itself from the Midtown pub herd with a look that's a mix of sports-bar butch and ornate kitsch.
They have an excellent selection (the rolls with crab are really great).
Great food, great prices, great service.
It seems like this is a place the locals like and the people working here liked it too.
Everything is very cheap.
but still my date was bad
Although small, it has beautiful ambience, excellent food (the catfish is delicious - if ya don't mind it a lil salty) and attentive service.
i actually feel like i should keep it a secret.
The service was a bit slow, but they were very friendly.
Just moved to the neighborhood and we've been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants.
It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects.
Unbelievable.
Try the Peanut Butter Sorbet and the pizza with soy cheese!
The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention.
The food is amazing, rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza.
The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese (gets a little messy).
Heartland Brewery is a great way to start or finish your day.
I loved it and would go again.
The chicken and falafel platters were nondescript combinations with fresh leaf salad.
The prices are wonderfully low.
I have eaten at some of the 'best' sushi joints in NYC (Nobu, Bond Street, JewelBako, etc) and Yamato is my favorite.
We didn't want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of Korbett it was just enough. 
Great food, great prices, great service.
Staff is very accomodating.
Awsome Pizza especially the Margheritta slice.
This particular location certainly uses substandard meats.
Less = More in their case.
I have gone back to Siam Square many times since and everytime I am very satisfied overall.
personally i say save your money.
We ordered the chicken casserole, but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken, all dark meat and on the bone.
enough said!
THE LASAGNA WAS PROBABLY THE BEST I HAVE TASTED.
My husbands was perfect, my was well done and dry.
It's all about the food !!
I've lived in NY for 5 years and this place has it all.
I just read Mocaramel's review and felt compelled to respond.
The food is great and the milkshakes are even better!
Straight-forward, no surprises, very decent Japanese food.
but ive heard a lot about this for the past 2 yrs and finally decided to eat here.
Buon appetito!
The fajita we tried was tasteless and burned and the mole sauce was way too sweet.
But don't ever order bacon late at nite (either platter or in sandwiches, for that matter don't from any take out place) as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacos, hurt my molars.

However, for what we spent, overall, it just was not up to par.
Sometimes tables don't understand his sense of humor but it's refreshing to have a server who has personality, professionalism, and respects the privacy of your dinner.
From the entrees to the sides to the drinks, everything was creatively prepared yet still simple.
Yum, the chicken is great here.
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience.
And I say snacking because it really is not set up to be a proper dinner.
Do yourself a favor and walk the extra avenue from joe's to eat here.
When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.
Next time, we wouldn't dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks.
From beginning appetizers, the scallops were incredible, to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sorbet, we were delighted by the taste sensations.
The food was boring and expensive.
Wonderful!
The dim sum is delectable while the prices are quite easy on the wallet.
On a recent Sunday afternoon, a friend and I accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT.
cirspy crust margherita pizza
I really didn't know what to expect for a restaurant that literally overlooks the main hall of Grand Central.
We got most of it back at home with us.
As I made the title, it's an affordable restaurant for great taste.
go here for the drinks!
And its absolutely DELICIOUS.
Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience.
Run don't walk.
Awesome
This place started off a little iffy, but is now one of my favorite indian restaurants in NYC (and I'm indian, so I should know).
The service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing.
The cuisine from what I've gathered is authentic Taiwanese, though its very different from what I've been accustomed to in Taipei.
Definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date.
It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects.
Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet, where greasy, dry and tasteless are complimentary.
However, go for the ambience, and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world!
A quintessential slice of NYC pizza.
They forgot a sandwich, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter.
Even when the chef is not in the house, the food and service are right on target.
This is a real gem of a place.
We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the wait for a table.
The plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom(third generation-Fornini) pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle( again making it soggy) and nothingon the rest.
If you are in search of the most authentic NYC deli experience look no further than the famous and historic Katz's Deli down on the Lower East Side.
The food was very good, a great deal, and the place its self was great.
The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn't even fully melted!
Go inside and you won't want to leave.
Once for dinner and once for brunch.
The room is a little plain, but it's difficult to make such a small place exciting and I would not suggest that as a reason not to go.
Not only did they have amazing, sandwiches, soup, pizza etc, but their homemade sorbets are out of this world!
We always go there on the weekends and leave extremely full and satisfied.
now if they could only get a toaster.
To me it exemplifies Soho, cute, artsy, interesting.
I recommend it!
Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you.
A cool bar with great food, and tons of excellent beer.
The portion sizes here are huge, and the sushi is good.
A little noise but I think that was because of our party!
When I arrived at Orsay I was thrown back, in a veyr good sense.
Ballato's is consistently delicious authentic italian food.
They even have a section in the menu called American Chinese food!
Fantastic place.
However, our $14 drinks were were horrible!
A weakness is the chicken in the salads.
Saul is pretty good, but definitely not great.
The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that.
The staff offers impeccable service.
But the pizza is way to expensive.
And $11 for a plate of bland guacamole?
Really.
THE FRANKENSTEIN SHOW WAS THE BEST.
