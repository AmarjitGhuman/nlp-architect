When	O
we	O
stumbled	O
on	O
Leon	B-ASP
,	O
we	O
thought	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
found	O
quite	O
the	O
gem	O
BUT	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
certainly	O
wrong	O
.	O

It	O
looked	O
like	O
shredded	B-ASP
cheese	I-ASP
partly	B-OP
done	I-OP
-	O
still	O
in	O
strips	O
.	O

Same	O
owner	B-ASP
as	O
the	O
guy	O
who	O
owns	O
Typhoon	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
just	O
down	O
the	O
street	O
on	O
St.	O
Marks	O
and	O
1st	O
Ave.	O

I	O
absolutely	O
love	B-OP
this	O
place	B-ASP
!!!	O

So	O
I	O
decide	O
to	O
report	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
waitress	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
completely	O
inedible	O
.	O

These	O
are	O
overpriced	O
and	O
you	O
can	O
get	O
better	O
just	O
around	O
the	O
corner	O
:	O

Despite	O
a	O
slightly	O
limited	B-OP
menu	B-ASP
,	O
everything	O
prepared	O
is	O
done	O

perfection	B-OP
,	O
ultra	O
fresh	B-OP

They	O
are	O
often	O
crowded	B-OP
on	O
the	O
weekends	O
but	O
they	O
are	O
efficient	B-OP
and	O
accurate	B-OP
with	O
their	O
service	B-ASP
.	O

The	O
place	B-ASP
is	O
small	B-OP
and	O
cramped	B-OP
but	O
the	O
food	B-ASP
is	O
fantastic	B-OP

Our	O
first	O
time	O
in	O
New	O

we	O
had	O

a	O
New	O

Not	O
cheap	O
but	O
very	O

The	O
only	O
possible	O
drawback	B-OP

is	O
that	O

the	O

What	O
is	O
even	O
better	B-OP

is	O
that	O
the	O

the	O
food	B-ASP
