My friends and I came across this place while walking in the village.
As soon as I wake up on a saturday or sunday it is the first thing on my mind is when and how I will be getting to fried dumpling.
It's like they took leftover chicken, poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it (the sauce was translucent and red).
If you are looking for a good quality, cheap eats - this is the place.
I was wrong.
Better than the bagel shop on the corner, but not worth going out of your way for, in my opinion.
The waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal!
Food was okay, nothing great.
We had our Christmas party at Dos Caminos and it was wonderful.
Our food was great too!
The food was just OK, I would never go back.
The quail was fantastic and unique and the pastas were full of flavor.
Definitely try the taglierini with truffles - it was incredible.
I'd call it an 'italian dinner'.
The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive.
Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes.
The specials are usually quite good too.
The location and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it.
I didn't complain, I liked the atmosphere so much.
Will go back but only sate those homesick stomach cravings!
Oh, and I never write reviews--I just was so moved by how bad this place was, I felt it was my duty to spread the word.
When you enter, you feel like you have entered your mom's kitchen.
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently.
This place is classy, chic, the service is warm and hospitable, and the food is outstanding.
I know because I live nearby.
I've never felt more unwelcome than last month at Jimmy's Bronx Cafe.
Old school meets New world.
I'm amazed we haven't been kicked out of this place yet.
I can say that the wraps, burgers and salads were all fresh, tasty and the mango margareta at $9 was WELL WORTH the money.
This place...god where do i begin.
The selection of food is excellent (I'm not used to having much choice at restaurants), and the atmosphere is great.
But make sure you have enough room on your credit card as the bill will leave a big dent in your wallet.
The only thing I could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my table.
They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends.
If you have a dumpling fetish i suggest you try some here!
Food was average and creme brulee was awful - the sugar was charred, not caramelized and smelled of kerosene.
Definitely Highly NOT recommended.
To be fair, the food still is good and the service is quick and attentative even though its usually very busy.
The service was great, and they have a whole great deal for birthdays.
Go hungry and enjoy.
They showed up 15 minutes after the tuna melt.
The food was absolutely horrible!
They are by far the BEST past in New York.
Nice view of river and NYC.
The chocolate raspberry cake is heavenly- not too sweet, but full of flavor.
It's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street.
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect, which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me, i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water, or the check.
The place is a little tight and on a cold day, the seating by the entranceway can be pretty drafty.
Simply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible prices...
Searching to get out from the cold, freezing weather, we went into what we thought was a deli.
I've come here for casual lunches as well as for a friend's birthday and I always enjoy myself.
Interesting other dishes for a change include chicken in curry sauce and salmon caserole.
Kosher dills are the perfect compliment for your unforgetable sandwich and they give you plenty of them.
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny.
Ciao Bella
They even scoop it out nice (for those on a diet) not too much not to little.
Quite frankly, this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried.
The best!
Toons has recently been redone, so it's now a very attractive space.
The food is very good too but for the most part, it's just regular food, nothing special.
Red Dragon Roll - my favorite thing to eat, of any food group - hands down
And amazingly cheap.
My family and I ate here last night for our annual Christmas dinner with the family members who would rather spend the holidays with friends out-of-town.
it's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food.
We ordered the special, grilled branzino, that was so infused with bone, it was difficult to eat.
A must try!
Pastrami or corned beef are juicy and piled high (ask for extra rye bread).
Gross food – Wow-
The atmosphere isn't the greatest , but I suppose that's how they keep the prices down .
MY date and I both ordered the Branzini and both felt the fish was very average.
This was the perfect quiet, relaxing, and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater.
I have been coming to this neighborhood spot for years.
I recommend this place to everyone.
The food did take a few extra minutes to come, but the cute waiters' jokes and friendliness made up for it.
Had a lovely dinner in this dedicated seafood joint, food was well-prepared and -presented and the service was pleasant and prompt.
Great wine selection, Gigondas is worth the price, and the house champagne is a great value.
They don't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai.
Haru on Park S is simply disgusting.
You won't find that anywhere in Manhattan.
(that is A MUST, but not every restaurant can do...) 
The wine list isn't great, and the desserts are shipped in from Bruno's down the street, which is not as good as it used to be.
Recommendations, of course, are required!
Trust me, it will be great, and all of it will be devoured in no time.
Not only have I worked in restaurants for many years, I am now in culinary school, I am a huge lover of oysters and fish, and my girlfriend is half Korean!
For the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated.
The sandwhiches are out-of-this world!
Food took some time to prepare, all worth waiting for.
This is probably one of my new favorite places.
While we thoroughly enjoyed the food, it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation.
Everything is always cooked to perfection, the service is excellent, the decor cool and understated.
I've been to Sotto Voce several time, and I have to say this one place that hits the nail right on the head ever time!
Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else.
They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great.
Best of all is the warm vibe, the owner is super friendly and service is fast.
This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money.
I am amazed by the poor reviews- I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian- great prices, great atmosphere, good service and a wonderful wine list.
The staff is incredibly helpful and attentive.
Succulent steaks cooked precisely to your desired 'doneness' accompanied by salads and sides that don't look like leafy road kill.
I found the variety of the sashimi plate to be satisfying - fresh and yummy.
The food is amazing, rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza.
We were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry.
Their sake martini is wonderful.
Their coffee is quite good too!
Also, specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you don't.
Their calzones are horrific, bad, vomit-inducing, YUCK.
I recieved prompt service with a smile.
Was her Monday for lunch - was working on a film in the area - and found this rare jewel.
$500 included:
Then, get ripped on free box wine.
Been there, done that, and New York, it's not that big a deal.
I will be going back very soon.
If you can handle that, it's a great place for a business dinner, fun with friends or simply a table for 2.
I have been going there since it opened and I can't get enough.
How do you rate home?
An excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but, the food was slightly disappointing.
I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side.
Got a little loud after 8pm when the joint got full.
Nice atmosphere, the service was very pleasant and the desert was good.
The food has been consistant for years and it never lets you down.
it's good but, like the movie is never as good as the book, this is same analogy.
Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon, which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave.
Have been several times and it never dissapoints.
We will be back.
The food however, is what one might expect.
I will recommend Scopa to all of my friends for a place to go for wonderful Italian food.
The table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long overdue bottle of wine finally arrived.
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category.
I am not a vegetarian but, almost all the dishes were great.
A great choice at any cost and a great deal.
Went there for an office lunch.
What a pleasant surprise!
The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that.
I LOOOVE their eggplant pizza, as well as their pastas!
The place was quiet and delightful.
My friend is 100% right in the experience we had.
We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu.
(I've ordered from the 2nd ave.
It hits the spot every time
You fellas above says its the best Taiwanese restaurant in town.
I agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience!
The atmosphere is much better than Sripraphai (more modern and sleek).
The service is descent even when this small place is packed.
Not cheap but very yummy.
I don’t usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but I’ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable dinner.
We didn't know if we should order a drink or leave?
Just ignore the trendy wannabes.
The bartenders and the managers are really nice and the decor is very comfy and laid-back, all the while being trendy.
The place is a lot of fun.
I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others.
The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out.
This food is asian-air fusion.
Conveniently located too, being right on Bedford ave.
last Tuesday for a late lunch with a friend.
This place was reccomended to me by a friend.
Over priced, overrated....stay away!
now if they could only get a toaster.
I guess the way my friends and I described it was The French Colonies.
Loved it
This place is a great bargain.
Eat at your own risk.
Yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously, but it shouldn't.
Aside from the Sea Urchin, the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail, Boton Shrimp, Blue Fin Torro (Fatty Tuna), Sea Eel, etc.
Also, waiters try to push more food on you, like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $.
This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird.
My wife and I always enjoy the young, not always well trained but nevertheless friendly, staff, all of whom have a story.
The quality of food at this restaurant accompanied  by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10!
The wine list is also really nice.
I have had so many dinners here and it's always been perfect - on a date with my husband, with my mom, with girlfriends and larger groups.
When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.
It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine.
Over time, the food quality has decreased substantially, it is a lot less crowded than it used to, and the service must definitely be part of the reason.
sometimes i get good food and ok service.
I love this place more and more everytime i go.
I was with a party of 7 (close but not next the the front doors) and we were eating with our coats on.
I go at least 3 times a month and have never been disappointed.
It is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no traffic noise.
We had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar food was just what we were looking for.
Looking from the outside in, one would hesitate to enter this hole in the wall (really, that's what it is).
i love the pics of andy warhol when he used to frequent the place (he painted the ballato's sign in the window).
I couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach.
Definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date.
The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music, and moreover, takes requests.
The food was very expensive (we spent $160 for lunch for two) but extremely tasty.
It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips.
never swaying, never a bad meal, never bad service...
Overall, I'm still impressed that the place even exists and the prices are quite decent but then again, its Chinatown.
Finally, I got sick of the bad service, obnoxious smirks, and snotty back talk.
Overall, this is a nice place to take a few friends to hang out at and the service is excellent.
We won't go to this place again for a good meal.
This place is a literal hole-in-the-wall that is buried within Doyers, right off of Pell St (barber's alley) in Chinatown.
I've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious.
Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening.
Sit outside in the warm weather; inside for cozy winter.
but the food was delicious.
The bread was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty.
Everyone was more then happy with his choices.
Good for dates or with friends.
I live in the neightborhood and am a regular.
Going to Ballato's is like coming home and eating in my own kitchen, an absolute delight!
I was really disappointed ant wanted to tell everyone not to go eat or even take out food from there.
We had half/half pizza, mine was eggplant and my friend had the buffalo and it was sooo huge for a small size pizza!
A big disappointment, all around.
The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual lunch here would probably be best.
I'm sure I'll return for a final judgement tho.
The ambience was so fun, and the prices were great, on top of the fact that the food was really tasty.
Also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side.
The food is wonderful, tasty and filling, and the service is professional and friendly.
The restaurant was packed at first, so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated.
Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey.
Certainly not the best sushi in New York, however, it is always fresh, and the place is very clean, sterile.
Great place to grab a hot bagel on the way to work.
The decor is really blah, and not at all hip or happening.
I work near-by, and they have the BEST oatmeal in the neighborhood- not a packaged or quick-cooked item.
It took half an hour to get our check, which was perfect since we could sit, have drinks and talk!
Kudos to Po!
While there's a decent menu, it shouldn't take ten minutes to get your drinks and 45 for a dessert pizza.
the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside.
their dinner specials are fantastic.
This restaurant is VEGETARIAN; there are NO MEAT dishes whatsoever.
A fairly late entry into the haute barnyard sweepstakes, Flatbush Farm isn't in the same league as the Blue Hills or even the Farm on Adderlys of the world, but it's pretty good, albeit with a somewhat dismal setting.
Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!
Oh yes, and if you are a fan of Indian oldies film stars, there are plenty of portraits of Indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls, some of which, I would love to know where they obtained.
strike up a conversation with the attorney next to you, or with the local union worker on the other side.
Definitely not a restaurant to skip!
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.
We started with the scallops and asparagus and also had the soft shell crab as well as the cheese plate.
We were then shooed inside.
Go to Volare for 1st class service and terrific food.
Great food, great decor, great service.
We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu.
The tables are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced.
An excellent service
From the terrible service, to the bland food, not to mention the unaccommodating managers, the overall experience was horrible.
I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks!
Cool atmosphere, the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night.
They brought glasses and the bottle, and just left the bottle at our table.
Once for dinner and once for brunch.
Its not the same if you have to sit inside.
What a great place.
You get the sense that the people there care about their restaurant and about your experience and that is very nice.
Brava La Pizza Fresca!
Bon appettite!!
...and that's saying a lot.
I ate here for the first time and absolutely loved it!
First of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review.
but overall i give it a 10
A little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite.
His food is excellent (and not expensive by NYC standards- no entrees over $30, most appetizers $12 to 14).
I'm a friendly person, so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal. 
Helpful service and average price per dish $10.
I will be going back and heartily recommend it!
The have a great cocktail with Citrus Vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that is to die for!
Quality ingredients preparation all around, and a very fair price for NYC.
Planet Thai is great!
Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting.
So we sat at the bar, the bartender didn't seem like he wanted to be there.
Food is average, and I would say even the chain restaurant Baluchi's tastes better.
Try the Peanut Butter Sorbet and the pizza with soy cheese!
Our friends have not arrived yet.
Much more reasonably priced too!
Based on a visit a month ago, I returned the week before Christmas and was hugely disappointed.
From the erbazzone emiliana to the mostarda on the cheese plate, the dishes at this restaurant are all handled with delicate care.
Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll.
I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window.
But WARNING: to all those that use this site be weary, be very weary of recommendations.
The service was typical short-order, dinner type.
Her review is above.
I found it on a cold night, the perfect spot to warm up.
This is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates.
I really loved the different and inovated touch that's the cheff gives to the food.
If you'd like to have a nice light meal with an asian accent, Long Tan is a good place on the slope.
I have never had anything like it!
Did I mention that the coffee is OUTSTANDING?
Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff.
Amma is nothing special.
I recommend to anyone who wants to dress up and impress the lady.
And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic.
Inside is a little cramped, but to be expected.
Great bagels made the old-fashioned way.
There are so many other great places to go to eat and drink..... this place is not worth it...
The Four Seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of New York City restaurants, but trust me, they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say "I've been to the four seasons restaurant".
first it took us a long time to find the place.
The beverages were excellent, and the dessert was good.
The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day.
The blond wood decor is very soothing, the premium sake is excellent and the service is great.
The Bagels have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture, both chewy yet not gummy.
I can't wait to go back.
The food is very average...the Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet, every thing they serve is too sweet here.
I've waited over one hour for food.
Decent wine selection too.
This is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood.
Compared to Ess-a, Tal offers a less doughy bagel!
Coffee is a better deal than overpriced Cosi sandwiches.
I LOVE their Thai noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST!
If you go here - your focus should be the Tamarind Margaritas.
With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored .
it's the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food.
I take all my NYC guests to VT's.
It took them 15 minutes to put water in our glasses.
The people in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud.
Yamato is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi, or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much.
Salads are a delicious way to begin the meal.
We ordered dosut bibimbap and nakgi-bokum.
When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.
I have walked by this place for eons and finally went thanks to a girls' night.
Hands down the best pizza on the planet.
My friend ordered some of their special sushi rolls which had excellent presentation and tasted great!
I recommend it!
Love it.
There is something about their atmosphere that makes me come back nearly every week.
Delish and made to your liking!
Stuffing yourself with Japanese food is a rare thing.
IT IS DEFINITELY SPECIAL AND AFFORDABLE.
Everything, from the soft bread, soggy salad, and 50 minute wait time, with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average food.
I would highly recommend it.
The lone argentine chorizo appetizer at $8.95 was a heavy fennel flavored Italian sausage like the ones that sell for $2.99/lb at the store.
Will absolutely visit again.
Dessert is a joke...dont bother
If only they delivered, they'd make a mint!
Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
They also do a great job for restaurant week.
fresh restaurant was amazing........ food was delicious and of course fresh.
Always popular, always full, always a wait.
You can do it here.
Bartender was unable to tear himself away from friends at bar.
Service was awful - mostly because staff were overwhelmed on a Saturday night.
This restaurant used to be pretty decent.
Other guests enjoyed pizza, santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips.
Seriously, this is the best all you can eat in town- As everyone says, the Spicy Tuna hand rolls are the best- have 4 of these, and you've broken even.
The food is o.k., but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant.
I've been here 3 times for lunch and it is one of my favorites in the city.
Believe me, they live up to the name.
They sell special sushi, everything have a topping, sauce and etc.
Total hipster-wannabe attitude in an otherwise sweet spot.
Ive been to many Thai restaurants in Manhattan before, and Toons is by far the best Thai food Ive had (except for my mom's of course).
There was only one waiter for the whole restaurant upstairs.
This is some really good, inexpensive sushi.
No gimmicks here -- the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation.
All the money went into the interior decoration, none of it went to the chefs.
Place is open till late, no dress code.
Also get the Onion Rings -- best we've ever had.
We also had shared a house salad that was fresh.
This place has good potential, but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else.
We had Lava Cake... we ordered when our food came it takes at least a 1/2 to make it. 
The menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent.
The food is alright - some stuff is good - some is not (like the steak dish which tends to be dry).
I found it on a cold night, the perfect spot to warm up.
This place was the worst.
I think this is one of the more underrated places in the city.
Dessert - can't be missed, so save room!!!
The staff isn't the friendliest or most competent, and I am stickler for service, but everything else about this place makes up for it.
When I'm feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office, I head for Cafe St. Bart's.
Maybe it was just an unintentional mistake but I've experienced the same with other restaurants so I don't appreciate such practice.
As for the bar, this is another bad idea.
The food is so cheap and the waiters are nice.
I always find myself sitting next to someone in the theatre industry- interesting to hear ideas hashed out while having a quick bite to eat.
I complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted.
The menu is nothing like the one on the website.
Good French restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you're into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at Katz' Deli, or Mexican food which is supplied by capable restaurants.
There is a downside if you're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude.
i recommend the thai popcorn :)
On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch.
Sandwiches, burgers and salads, like the lemon-dressed cobb, are classic successes.
less wait time for me!
Fast service.
Interesting selection, good wines, service fine, fun decor.
really depends on your luck!
Best restaurant in Brooklyn
Nicky the Nose at the bar is a treat.
Wouldn't recomend it for dinner!
My husband and I have been sold on this from the first visit.
I recommend any of their salmon dishes......
This is the kind of place you'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret.
The drinks are great, especially when made by Raymond.
This is the BEST Shabu-Shabu Restaurant in the Try-State Area.
Consistently good Japanese Tapas.
Bobb V's is a great place to take your Friends and Family!
Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner
After my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer.
The food is yummy, especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries.
As far as the service goes, the waitresses were not particularly friendly, but they got the job done.
A little crowded but they move that line really fast!
And that's no mean feat...
Our visit their to say the least, was an unpleasant and costly experience!
Love YUKA.
I go twice a month!
Don't go with a larger group than 4! 
Small, bright, and clean, BZ Grill stands apart from the usual run of gyro joints, both in Astoria and out.
The food is spectacular, from the appitizers to the main course, and then of course the desserts, (WOW) you'll need no more.
I've had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times, when I have been in the neighborhood.
Not worth it.
And I would have to agree with the masses in terms of service - delivery is their Achilles' heel.
I am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience.
What a great place.
There are many french bistros in the midtown area, and I wholheartedly recommend this one.
I recently visited over this past summer after being away for a year.
If you are in a big group, this place is perfect because it recomends sharing - they have lazy susans on most tables - even families can feel comfortable here.
Food and service was okay.
Fabulous service, fantastic food, and a chilled out atmosphere and environment.
On that scale, it's a world-beater.
The bagel was huge.
I have been living in NYC for bit now and I have to say I love to go out and explore the scene.
I pray it stays open forever.
Reasonably priced with very fresh sushi.
While the food was excellent, it wasn't cheap (though not extremely expensive either).
The service was on point - what else you would expect from a Ritz?
The rolls are creative and I have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious japanese food.
Most importantly, food is excellent.
Make sure you try this place as often as you can.
We try frequenting new restaurants all over the city, but any time that we  visit a restaurant other than Roth's we are always disappointed.
Watch the talented belly dancers as you enjoy delicious baba ganoush that's more lemony than smoky.
esp. during happy hour!
I'm not picky - but it was actually gross.
The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry, inedible chicken with terrible sauce.
The sake’s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world.
The food was delicious (I had a halibut special, my husband had steak), and the service was top-notch.
It is by far my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn.
Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit, but the food was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues.
This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money.
They are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine, so if you want to make a reservation you are limited.
Offerings like hot cakes and the Egg McMuffin sandwich are available for breakfast.
Last memorial day, I tried to make reservations but was told they were closed that weekend (interesting, but...).
The staff is accomodating, the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed, and the food is out of this world!
What I didn't like was how the food came right after it was ordered.
Never in my life did I think that I could be satisfied both in taste and in quantity for $3.00 in NYC.
Not only is the food authentic, but the staff here are practically off-the-boat, they are young and hip and know what they are doing when it comes to food and wine.
I absolutely love this place!!!
I'd definitely go back again.
I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently.
This place is average... at best.
Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service.
The waitress remembers me and is very friendly, she knows what my regular is and that's the fried mini buns with the condensed milk and the assorted fruits on beancurd.
I come from a family of pizzeria owners, and I'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in Fornino's blows my families receipies away.
The Thai ice tea was amazingly smooth and yummy!
In summer-eat outside on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!
The white bean brushetta to start was incredible and the pasta was phenomenal.
A cool bar with great food, and tons of excellent beer.
Likewise if you like really thin crust or really big slices then Nick and Joe's may not be your favorite.
It's somewhere you can eat and be happy.
Delivery guy sometimes get upset if you don't tip more than 10%.
The ground chickpea soup we sampled as a starter tasted somewhat thin.
In fact, while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu, and I couldn't help telling them that the food was horrible.
also it's great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable place, the service it's just perfect...they're so frendly that we never want to live the place!
If you're in town, it's worth searching for another place.
The food was terrific and the service classy, attentive, without being overbearing.
There is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me.
Overall, not worth the money.
I highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try.
The wine list is extensive, well priced and covers alot of regions.
Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet.
It took them 25 minutes to bring our appetizer.
Always a nice crowd, but never loud.
Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
Priced at upper intermediate range.
I went there with a few friends and will return.
It is nearly impossible to get a table, so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner, DO NOT pass it up.
the food was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining.
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!
My wife and I always enjoy the young, not always well trained but nevertheless friendly, staff, all of whom have a story.
The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches.
The food is just OKAY, and it's almost not worth going unless you're getting the pialla, which is the only dish that's really good.
Service was very good and warm.
Outstanding Bagels, but you get what you pay for.
Well worth the trip, close to City Hall and downtown subway stops.
And its absolutely DELICIOUS.
I found the food to be outstanding, particulary the salmon dish I had.
I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one.
So rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary!
They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another.
I was there on sat.
even the wine by the glass was good.
The closest that I got was the Cherry Marscapone, but they were out of it that day.
The atmosphere is nothing special, but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo.
Also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side.
Great food, amazing service, this place is a class act.
A defitely must visit.
A million better places to go in the city.
While I quite liked the food and the ambience, I'm not quite sure if it they really deserve it the Michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window.
The food was delicious and the waiter was incredibly helpful and attentive (considering we were the only ones there for the first hour).
I felt as though I were eating in Paris.
And I've been to many NYC delis.
The wine the service was very good too.
We asked for beverages and never received them.
I like the ambience, it's very dark and original.
There restaurant is very casual, but perfect for lunch, and their delivery service is always very fast.
So, a little inconsistency there but either way, both pizzas were really good.
but for the value, it was a great affordable spot to enjoy a fun night out with small group.
This place is great.
We love the food, drinks, and atmosphere!
Great sushi experience.
I have been in NYC for over 10 years and could not find this delicacy east of the Hudson .
I'm telling you...
I never had anything I didn't like here.
I was very disappointed with this restaurant.
The catch is that you are charged extra for ANYTHING that you leave on your plate so don't be a greedy pig!
I love Indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it.
The kitchen however, is almost always slow.
Delicious, creative and fun.
We picked it randomly, without a recommendation from someone who has been there, so we weren't sure what to expect.
The food was great.
I can't remember the last time I had such gross food in New York.
No dress codes, no attitudes, plenty of comfort companionship, a great place to relax in an always busy Midtown.
Service was decent, but not as smooth as I would expect from a place with these prices and reputation.
What really makes it shine is the food, which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro meat and sausages), and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected.
The best burger I have had in the Village.
Siam Square is fairly new to the neighborhood and I think in time will gain the recognition it deserves.
I really loved the different and inovated touch that's the cheff gives to the food.
The sandwiches are dry, tasteless and way overpriced.
Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them.
Menus feature seasonal picks, like sweet corn-foie gras brulee.
The staff was accomodating, the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely.
It is so romantic.
The flavors are great, and the menu is extensive.
All-time favorites include the Big Mac, Chicken McNuggets, Filet-O-Fish sandwich and McDonald's famous french fries; lighter options like entree-sized salads are also available.
That said, I thought Scalini Fedeli was one of the best dining experiences I've EVER had.
This tiny Williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising.
Alain Ducasse is the best of everything, I mean everything was excelent.I
The service was bad, the food took to forever to come, we sat on the upper level.
Just straight up cheap, good food.
I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere!
However, it's not worth a special trip.
A must for all the Dosa lovers.
The food was as creative as the decor and both worked.
Pick a bagel has the best bagels in the city.
Service was devine, oysters where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat!!!
Had no flavor and the staff is rude and not attentive.
It is sometimes a little cramped, and can get a little warm, but hello, it's NYC!
Small servings for main entree, i had salmon (wasnt impressed) girlfriend had chicken, it was good.
The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.
Great atmoshere and worth every bit.
So if you want a nice, enjoyable meal at Montparnasse, go early for the pre-theater prix-fixe.
The food, drinks and service are clearly among the best in the city.
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian.
Highly recommended.
We had a good time.
Dakshin is one of the few affordable and tasty Indian restaurant in the upper east side.
Ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me.
I was wrong.
Once for dinner and once for brunch.
The food was really good, I had the onion soup and it was one of the best ever.
great for a romantic evening, or a fun evening with friends...
After all that, they complained to me about the small tip.
You guys are awesome!
It's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early.
Very "normal Indian food", but done really well.
While the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made Tiffin so attractive, the menu has been overhauled.
even the wine by the glass was good.
I would highly recommend this place!
As we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were.
If you've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer.
Always great service!
The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
The food options rule.
They seemed to continue to rush us along, taking plates without asking if we were done (my sister still had her fork in hand). 
So what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food.
The steak was very fatty and the sauce was overpowering and not very tasty.
It was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York, and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to New York.
Compared to other shabu restaurants around town, this places wins hands-down.
I must say the view of NYC is so beautiful!
Food is always fresh and hot- ready to eat!
I will be going back and heartily recommend it!
I'm not picky - but it was actually gross.
Lives up to the hype
I take all my NYC guests to VT's.
A cheap eat for NYC, but not for dosa.
This was a repeat visit and we'll definitely be back again.
I was glad I did.
Very pleased
Whenever you need a Sushi fix, Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service.
The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.
It is nearly impossible to get a table, so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner, DO NOT pass it up.
Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place.
Oh, don't even let me start with how expensive the bills were!
My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge!
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices.
For myself and family we would only go here to celebrate an occassion, I do prefer smaller, quiter restaurants.
It is thick and slightly soggy.
I went here with my boyfriend for our anniversary.
The entire place and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt.
Would NEVER go back
Seriously, this place kicks ass.
Besides, we were on vacation!
Plus they made a perfect martini.
Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months.
The Cypriot restaurant has a lot going for it.
I would recommend to ask for a bigger sitting area when you make a reservation (if possible)
Orsay, is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic French food in NYC.
Not cheap, but not that expensive either.
The food however, is what one might expect.
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested.
I don't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer.
Overall I was impressed and will return, it's a great QPR (Quality to Price Ratio).
Also, because it is so thin, it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling.
I love it.
I am surprised to say the least and find such practice not worth the effort.
Probably would not go back here.
All in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side, but fresh. 
Way below average
The problem is just that-it is a sometimes kind of affair.
The quality of the meat was on par with your local grocery store.
Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else.
It's not mind-blowing, but to me, thai food never is and never will be.
This place is the most Japanese it can ever get.
Overall the food quality was pretty good, though I hear the salmon is much better when it hasn't sat cooling in front of the guest.
However, I was there for a work dinner not long ago when my colleague from London noticed a very large waterbug on the ceiling.
The ambience is also more laid-back and relaxed.
Love Pizza 33..
Service- friendly and attentive.
Well, their deliveries take for ever and the food is usually cold.
We were less than impressed.
If you are a Tequila fan you will not be disappointed.
Cuisine is billed as asian fusion - doesn't meet the bill.
However, I think this place is a good hang out spot.
The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance.
It's a great place to pick up a cheap lunch or dinner.
Best things to order are from the grill (Churrasco and Ribs).
The place's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh.
Also very inexpensive.
They also have a back garden open in the summer - cute and French with outdoor seating - what more could you ask for?
But the thai is definitely not great -- bland and indistinguished.
The atmosphere takes you to that place, the place many dream of.
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt).
Guaranteed to be a tasty experience!)
Fresh veggies, all sorts of middle eastern spreads, cheese and falafel, soup, fish, rice, root vegetables, a rice medley, some spinach thing, lamb kebabs, cheese baclava... soooo much fooood, and all of it delicious.
The portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter.
The takeout menu says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more italian dishes, I can't wait!
I found this restaurant to be one that truly values its patrons.
This place has many different styles of pizza and they are all amazing.
Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers, no matter what the reviews say.
The sauce may not be for everyone, since it is distintive.
So close, but not good enough.
Would you ever believe that when you complain about over an hour wait, when they tell you it will be 20-30 minutes, the manager tells the bartender to spill the drinks you just paid for?
The corned beef and pastrami are excellent, much less fatty than those big tourist places around Times Square.
The food is very good, but not outstanding.
The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well.
Sushi wasn't anything spectacular for the price.
My six year old loved it.
If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines,please check their wine list.
The wine list is also really nice.
The Yellowtail was particularly good as well.
The service, however, is a peg or two below the quality of food (horrible bartenders), and the clientele, for the most part, are rowdy, loud-mouthed commuters (this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff) getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game.
The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard.
Great service, great food.
Everything was wonderful; food, drinks, staff, mileau.
There was a small group of us looking somewhere to eat kinda late on a weeknight and we ended up at Pastis.
I live in the neightborhood and am a regular.
We have been to Montparnasse many times and return often for good reason.
We didn't get drink refills and she didn't even offer us the option of dessert.
Amazing!
The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri, sevpuri and samosa chaats, as well as other great indian appetizers.
We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday, and I was thoroughly impressed with the food.
My friend's food was also the complete opposite of what it's supposed to taste like (aND look like).
Try the chocolate mud cake (warmed) with 2 scoops of dulce de leche gelato.
Go girls!!!
I'm happy to have Nosh in the neighborhood and the food is very comforting.
This is a fun restaurant to go to.
The service is a bit slow, but harkens back to my years growing up in Napoli, Italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night.
the pad se ew chicken was delicious, however the pad thai was far too oily.
The absolute worst service I've ever experienced and the food was below average (when they actually gave people the meals they ordered).
Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.
They treat me like family, morning and night.
Service was good and food is wonderful.
Probably my worst dining experience in new york, and I'm a former waiter so I know what I'm talking about.
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines.
The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.
Service is highly refined: our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress.
They were dry, stale and pretty flavorless.
May, the owner always has a smile on her and will warmly greet you.
The prices cannot be beat for the quality, quantity, freshness and taste.
Leon is an East Village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic French bistro fare, good specials, a warm and lively atmosphere.
After that she simply took our plates, walked away, came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it!!!!!!!!!!!!
I've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious.
They have homemade pastas of all kinds -- I recommend the gnocchi -- yum!
Food is usually very good, though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders.
The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.
Some servers make you feel like they are doing you a favor to bring you the food.
My vegetable risotto was burnt, and infused totally in a burnt flavor.
I decided to try out this place after hearing about it in many magazines.
Casa La Femme is to middle eastern dining what Chuckie Cheeze is to italian.
Our waiter was friendly and it is a shame that he didnt have a supportive staff to work with.
Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens, this is among the best.
I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!
And really large portions.
The restaurant is rather small but we were lucky to get a table quickly.
Intimate but charming interior with extremely friendly and attentive service.
They charge $6.00 for rice.
The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate.
The food is flavorful, plentiful and reasonably priced.
Even though its good seafood, the prices are too high.
The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
For dinner I had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan.
my favorite place lol
It was such a fantastic dining experience, that I returned again the same week.
We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai.
Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service, which was boarderline rude.
I had the best ravioli ever.
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place.
And Kruno, the beverage manager is the best bartender I have yet to come across.
Despite a slightly limited menu, everything prepared is done to perfection, ultra fresh and a work of food art.
Based on the reviews on here, it appears that the restaurant is overwhelmed after the 7 PM.
However, go for the ambience, and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world!
The food is very good and the service is great.
Look I dont know if the people who wrote the reviews have ever been to a decent place (PLEASE TRY SOMEOTHER PLACES).
This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets, with that certain Parisian flair.
Great food!
What a great place!
Walk-ins are risky too.
The svc can be a bit rude at times, esp if you have big group, but overall the restaurant is a must!
Wasn't going to share but I feel obligated...while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing.
Great bar, most gorgeous bartenders you've ever seen (specifically the blond lady).
The only friendly staff member was the guy at the bar.
I love Indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it.
Staffs are not that friendly, but the taste covers all.
If just to drop in, quickly stuff yourself and jet out -- to keep their turn-over.
Sweet Irish bartender is always happy and able to bring a smile to my friends a my face.
To celebrate a birthday, three of us went to Mare anticipating great food.
Our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese.
Besides, when you have bad service, that's less money you have to tip.
The music which is sometimes a little too heavy for my taste.
There is usually a wait but it is well worth it.
We all agreed that mare is one of the best seafood restaurants in New York.
I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date.
Our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken (usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats).
When I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else.
Unbelievable.
Great wine, great food.
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose.
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt).
I love the Little Pie Company as much as anyone else who has written reviews, but must discourage anyone from visiting the Grand Central location due to their RUDE service from two sales people.
Also, I personally wasn't a fan of the portobello and asparagus mole.
Service was also very good.
Haru serves very fresh fish, has a trendy, modern ambiance, prime location on Park Avenue South and friendly service.
the restaurant was completely empty, but she gave me a dirty look and asked, no reservations?
Eating in, the atmosphere saves it, but at your desk, it's a very disappointing experience.
The Dim Sum was so-so, but not spectacular.
The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall, which are great for a date.
A pleasant surprise.
Never fails to please.
People dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans.
Even with the prix fixe pricing, this restaurant is not worth it.
enough said!
Creative dishes like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette and fettuccine with grilled seafood in a rosemary-orange sauce are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable bistro menu.
believe us, we've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs.
The palak paneer was standard, and I was not a fan of the malai kofta.
The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention.
They offer the same menu but have creative drinks that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names -- but they do cost you.
The staff has always been friendly without seeming grating, and the chef has greeted us on a couple of occasions.
I'm from England, and Haru's was the best I had in NYC.
I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot, and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food.
The appetizers are just OK and the main courses were decidedly subpar.
I in all reality felt as if I had just gotten off Air France and was in the 8th District in Paris.
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, two types of sake, and the banana tempura.
A Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner?
Best hot dogs in the tri-state area.
I would highly recommend it.
I've been a regular customer at Juice Generation for the last 3 months - my office moved to the Film Center on Ninth Avenue and they are on the next block.
However, service was as plain as sesame crusted Salmon I had.
Servers are all different, Greg is my favorite.
For all of you new to Indian food, try the Paneer Roll, it is a piece of heaven.
My roommate and I LOVE this place.
Filled with suits, though, so you never really feel terribly comfortable.
BEST DINING EXPERIENCE IN THE WEST VILLAGE!
I really liked this place.
The service is ok, some of the people didn't get what they asked for.
People dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans.
I loved it and will be back soon.
stick with the chicken, beef, and lamb dishes.
The food is outstanding and the service is quick, friendly and very professional.
Loved it!
Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem!
peppers, onions, relish, chilli, cheeses, you NAME it.
Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place, but not any longer.
Skip Nathan's...you can get that at the mall...go to Bark.
it was a very warm experience.
Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet, where greasy, dry and tasteless are complimentary.
But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the BTs.
too large for just two people but nothing was left.
This lovely French-Asian fusion restaurant stands out amongst other great restaurants on Smith Street.
While we enjoyed the food, we were highly disappointed by the poor service (waiter was not quite competent and SLOW service) and lack of remorse.
Always a nice crowd, but never loud.
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose.
They are served on Focacchia bread and are to die for.
Had a late night dinner on a Saturday night.
There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table.
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines.
Pricey, but worth a try, at least once.
but ive heard a lot about this for the past 2 yrs and finally decided to eat here.
Going to Bark is always worth the train ride, and will make your tongue and belly very happy!
I really liked the noodle dishes at Rice Avenue compared to their Green Curry dish.
I was especially impressed during the bday party when the waitstaff went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly service to a 15 person party.
Even though I made the reservation at 3pm for the same night through Dinnerbroker, we were seated at a table with one of the best view!
Amazing!
We went there, no one greeted us.
Went here on a friend's reccomendation.
The food's dazzling flavors overwhelm the palate, truly embracing the beauty of authentic Thai cuisine.
For the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan.
Have a mojito and sit in the back patio.
I just had my first visit to this place and can't wait to go back and slowly work my way through the menu.
The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn't even fully melted!
too large for just two people but nothing was left.
My goodness, everything from the fish to the rice to the seaweed was absolutely amazing.
The ambience was so fun, and the prices were great, on top of the fact that the food was really tasty.
Delicious crab cakes too.
The food is amazing... especially if you get the Chef's tasting menu and your favourite bottle (or two!) of wine from an extensive selection of wines.
whoever the jazz duo was, they were on POINT.
The pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere.
but their mac cheese was YUMMY!
Have to tell you: Not at all impressed.
My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge!
The music is the best among all the Indian restaurants I have visited.
I was speechless by the horrible food.
Deep Fried Skewers are good and still rare to find in NYC.
The food is wonderful, artfully done and simply delicious.
The food is good, especially their more basic dishes, and the drinks are delicious.
The main course had an average portion, and was decent overall.
I've never been disappointed.
My husband and I enjoy Sangria.
The price very reasonable.
Raga stands out with an interesting fusion of French and Indian cooking.
This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn.
It took 100 years for Parisi to get around to making pizza (at least I don't think they ever made it before this year)...but it was worth the wait.
Faan is sooo good.
If you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave.
I think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation.
I mentioned the squid dish wasn't very good when the waitress visited.
In fact, two people could really share one plate.
Romantic if you want it to be (brightly lit).
I have tried the various slice joints around the village but this is by far the best one.
A guaranteeed delight!
I have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.
The place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening.
Overall, excellent restaurant!
I could have drank 4 glasses of water and still been parched - so watch out.
I thought going to Jimmys would give me a real Domincan exprience.
Great deal!
I noticed alot of indian people eatting there which is a great sign for an indian place!
Make sure you try this place as often as you can.
However, it is jus too good to not praise it.
We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh.
We always get a sampling of appetizers and share.
Try the lasagnette appetizer.
Pizza is terrific, as is homemade pasta.
When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently 
Try green curry with vegetables.
I went with 5 friends and we lingered at the table for a bit and didn't feel rushed at all even though there was a wait.
They couldn't even make a salad that was appealing.
The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.
You should pass on the calamari.
The cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee!!
The food was very well prepared.
The restuarant itself is not large, but seems to have several round tables to accomodate large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic Taiwanese.
Over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals.
Quite simply it's like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tranquility.
The staff is incredibly helpful and attentive.
The appetizing is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable price (if bought by the pound).
The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals.
Service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded.
I am not the most experienced person when it comes to Thai food, but my friend who took me there is.
We were seated promptly as we had reservations, however after that the service was slow.
Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that.
We had a party in their private room and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning.
Just straight up cheap, good food.
However, it just so happens that there's an even more amazing place just down the street.
The jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes.
The food is above average for midtown and sligtly better than some of the other Heartland Breweries in the city.
I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read.
Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable.
P.S. Please don't tell anyone in my family i eat there.
It took a bigger bite from my wallet than my appetite - I would not reccomend this to anyone that I would want to talk to me again!!
It was pretty inexpensive too.
Among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants, this offers by far one of the best values for your money.
I've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years: A new Jazz Bar, the most fantastic Dining Garden, the Best Thin Crust Pizzas, and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for (these are not your average lasagnas)!
The two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place.
Not enough wines by the glass either.
The place has a nice fit-out, some attractive furnishings and, from what I could tell, a reasonable wine list (I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins)
Great people watching as others do the same to you.
This place has beautiful sushi, and it's delicious CHEAP. 
My girlfriend convinced me to go in the other night for a quick bite.
It cannot be the ambience, because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle.
The Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience.
This restaurant is not worth the time, effort, or money to say the least.
Sure enough, exactly 30 minutes later we got the call and were seated promptly.
The view is breathtaking the service is top notch... the ambiance is wonderfull.
Regardless, we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio.
I have never been disappointed but their true strength lays in their amazingly delicious and cheap lunch specials.
Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot, once you enter the unmarked wooden doors, the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you’re no longer in the city.
While most people can attest to spending over $50 on drinks in New York bars and hardly feeling a thing, the drinks here are plentiful and unique.
Been there, done that, and New York, it's not that big a deal.
During the course of the past 3 months, the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better.
Wow.
David, Daytona Beach, FL
We've lived in the area for more than 8 years.
Suan is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too.
MMMMMMMMMmmmmmm so delicious
The price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate.
Only complaint would be that at an average cost of $12-$15 per meal, I'd like not to have to worry about finding a seat!
It's a basic pizza joint, not much to look at, but the pizza is what I go for.
Although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great.
The octopus eaters were floored by the Octopus salad.
How is this palce still open?
The price is reasonable although the service is poor.
Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey.
We, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude.
It is the best hidden spot there and I rave about it to everyone.
This made it obvious that the food wasn't cooked fresh; it was obviously made before hand and then reheated.
Definitely something to come down and check out.
Oh, and there's hookah.
Service is average.
THR AT MOSHPHERE IS COMPACT, MODERN, YET COZY.
Great staff.
Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit.
All the staff is absolutely professional!! 
If you want some roast duck, pork or chicken on rice with ginger, try them out!
No you're going to go back because the food was good.
To speak of the Park Side, words can not describe.
Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you, but the food doesn't quite match up.
Great spot, whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner.
The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary.
The pesto pizza was excellent, thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I'd never heard of before.
I love the fact that the pizza tastes so good and is so cheap.
I'm not even going to bother to describe it; it speaks for itself.
As a student in NYU i need a place to eat after a hard day of work so usually i just go to any indian restraunt near by. 
The place was quiet and delightful.
I usually go there later at night when I get off work so I don't have to deal with crowds or lines.
This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart's and I must say how delicous the food and the service was.
If you are looking for a good quality, cheap eats - this is the place.
Obviously the Chinese translation of this place does not mean Big Wong, it actually means Great Prosperity.
The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don't like.
The food arrived in about 15 minutes. 
Cute place, nice wait staff but would never go there again.
Atmosphere is nice and relaxed too...
Of course, it is crowded but who cares.
I would definently recommend this restaurant.
The place just isn't ready for prime time.
As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited.
Other guests enjoyed pizza, santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips.
However, for what we spent, overall, it just was not up to par.
Had a great meal there this weekend before heading to the movies!
I have been in many restaurants all over the city and Roth's Steakhouse has quickly become one of my favorites.
Definitely a neighborhood favorite.
I recommend the jelly fish, drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings, certainly the stir fry blue crab.
I asked for seltzer with lime, no ice.
All in all, this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city.
The pesto pizza was excellent, thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I'd never heard of before.
Result (red velvet): Great texture, soft and velvety, nice hint of cocoa.
If you are in search of the most authentic NYC deli experience look no further than the famous and historic Katz's Deli down on the Lower East Side.
Frankly, the chinese food here is something I can make better at home.
For instance, plates were just dumped on the table, I was handed the wine list upside down, etc.... 
Would NEVER go back there.
In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food, this is one of the best spots.
We went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different.
I had very high expectations for this place and made a reservation a couple of months in advance for a special occasion.
and for this i had to shell out a small fortune?
La Rosa waltzes in, and I think they are doing it the best.
Oh right, I should probably say something nice.
Taj Mahal offeres gret value and great food.
None was made so i hung up.
Maybe tomorrow ;-)
The dishes are remarkably tasty and such a cozy and intimate place!
It is expensive but well worth the money.
Food was just average...if they lowered the prices just a bit, it would be a bigger draw.
The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean.
We started with lox and mussels (the best ive ever had, ever) and had the cod and trout for dinner.
Each bite of food at Kai was indeed delicious, fresh, and elegant.
Baluchi's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices.
In the summer months, the back garden area is really nice.
Go for it!
For some reason the place was empty when we got in and remained so for the entire evening, I don't understand why but we had a blast and will definately go back the next time we are in the area.
They are extremely rude, not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some drinks adn their pita bread!
The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes.
Where Gabriela personaly greets you and recommends you what to eat.
SEA has become so popular that they've let it go to their heads.
I would definitely come back to this restaurant.
Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you're with.
Stay away if you're claustrophobic
Food is great.
The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes.
No desert menu, no apology, nothing!!!!!!
Wonderful!
they were dry and disgusting, i didn't even finish my first piece.
We do not need to go to a four-star restaurant anymore.
BEST spicy tuna roll, great asian salad.
Try the rose roll (not on menu).
Usually 3 vs. 4 items per dish.
I will be returning.
Once you step into Cosette, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro.
Mussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening.
If you like Sakagura but you feel it's too much, you'd better try Yokocho.
This place is to be avoided.
This is the kind of place you'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret.
My wife and I visited Dokebi tonight.
The sauces used are also not that exciting.
However, it is jus too good to not praise it.
I completely recommend Casa La Femme for any special occasion and to REALLY impress your date.
Good luck getting a table.
Have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience.
I ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime.
We all felt it was worth it.
The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in quantity AND quality).
The vibe is very relaxed and cozy, service was great and the food was excellent!
Right off the major deegan you get ladies from all over the city.
Just an odd group.
Love their drink menu.
Maybe it's that most of Dumont's patrons are younger and have lower expectations, but I cannot recommend Dumont.
I often find myself with time to kill in Times Square, which is a shame since I don't love this area.
It's about $7 for lunch and they have take-out or dine-in.
Never again!
First went here to enjoy their garden terrace.
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHERS ON THE BLOCK WERE LIKE BUT WE WERE PLEASED WITH OUR CHOICE.
The place is a bit hidden away, but once you get there, it's all worth it.
By far, the best pizza in Manhattan.
Go hungry and enjoy.
From the street it looks very hidden, and is actually an old warehouse.
Even for two very hungry people there is plenty of food left to be taken home (it reheats really well also).
Overall, decent food at a good price, with friendly people.
The two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place.
When you want a piece of beef, head on over.
I think this would be a pretty good spot if it were not so overpriced and overrated.
I highly recommend this beautiful place.
This is where it really really gets bad: the manager said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I cannot comp it.
Decor is charming.
But that wasn't the icing on the cake: a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had.
If your favorite Chinese food is General Tao chicken, then this is NOT your place.
LLOOVVE THIS PLACE.
Keep up the good work guys!
The portions are HUGE, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and entree per person) for two people.
always fresh and delicious.
I have NEVER been disappointed in the Red Eye.
Highly recommended to all!
The cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan.
The fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef (usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt).
I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries.
Great vibe, lots of people.
The plain slice is great and if you get toppings, the whole slice is topped with them, not sparsely sprinkled on like some places.
And I could do without the cigar smoke.
If we were to move from the upper east side, we would genuinely miss this restaurant.
Dishes denoted as "Roy's Classics" (marked on the menu with asterisks) are tried-and-true recipes, such as macadamia-crusted mahi mahi, or subtly sweet honey-mustard beef short ribs.
its a little out of the way if you don't live in the neighborhood, but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are.
The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner.
The food was delicious, the atmosphere was relaxed, and we have now adopted Plate 347 as our Secret on Second!
But don't ever order bacon late at nite (either platter or in sandwiches, for that matter don't from any take out place) as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacos, hurt my molars.
All conveniently delivered right to the door.
A con was the slow bar service.
When you add it all together, it just doesn't seem worth it to me...especially considering the prices.
The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in quantity AND quality).
The service is outstanding and my crab-cake eggs benedict could not have been better.
The flavors robust and subtle.
Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant.
Good food.
It was wonderful.
Nevertheless, I finished my plate, and that's when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom.
Innovations are just as assured, from the simple Carinthia cheese ravioli with wild mushrooms to the caviar-topped sturgeon, beautifully matched with a bright green spinach-vodka sauce.
The waiters ALWAYS look angry and even ignore their high-tipping regulars.
I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service.
Interesting selection, good wines, service fine, fun decor.
Mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila.
Also good for client lunch meetings, esp.
We arrived for dinner expecting to be impressed by a place that has an impressive past - but, that's just it -- the PAST!
I can't wait for the nex time.
Ciao Bella
We couldn't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and servants asking us to order and hinting that we're taking too much time -- amazing, we just sat down.
Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.
It's constantly open, catering to the Pakistani cabbies lined up on Crosby St., so there's more turnover with the food than you'd expect (i.e., surprisingly fresh).
Anywhere else, the prices would be 3x as high!
I really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi (on saffron risotto-yum!).
Overall, the best bagel in town.
THIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED.
Murray won't do it.
The cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables, but the service could have been better.
Stuffing yourself with Japanese food is a rare thing.
I am a 100 lb girl, had a glass of wine and a glass of beer prior to the dinner, and I was still HUNGRY after my visit to this place!
The food was absolutely amazing!!
Food portion was SMALL and below average.
I ordered the vitello alla marsala and I was pretty impressed.
And affordable.
the service is prompt friendly.
All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends!
I will go back to Suan soon!
Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return. 
And $11 for a plate of bland guacamole?
When we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing.
This is the first time Citysearch did't call it right.
It's also attached to Angel's Share, which is a cool, more romantic bar...
Everything I had was good, and I'm a eater.
The lamb was tender so full of flavor, the dessert was divine!!
We were greeted promptly by the waiter who was very nice and cordial.
i went in one day asking for a table for a group and was greeted by a very rude hostess.
It was totally overpriced- fish and chips was about $15.... 
A very inviting restaurant, with friendly service.
Authentic Pakistani food.
Fresh, mind blowing flavors.
We got a little tipsy from the sake but isn't that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about?
The crab cakes are delicious and the BBQ rib was perfect.
Been to the one in Brooklyn for over 25 years, now I dont have to go over the bridge for the best pizza ....Hanx
The atmosphere isn't the greatest , but I suppose that's how they keep the prices down .
I honestly don't even know where to begin.
This is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the Basil slice.
I have to say I have never had a disapointing meal here.
Okay-i don't mind the oily part (cause most are cooked that way) but it was way too bland.
The menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent.
The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome, great appetizer to share!
The menu is interesting and quite reasonably priced.
Favourites include: potato spinach gnocchi and the lamb.
I thought the restaurant was nice and clean.
Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.
I recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal!
Good service, great food, good value, and never have to wait in line!
The food is great, I love their dumplings, cold sesame noodles, chicken and shrimp dishs.
The dim sum servings here are a bit larger than I'm used to.
The pizza is the best if you like thin crusted pizza.
And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience.
Good Food
Don't judge this place prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart.
The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese (gets a little messy).
I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.
The food was delicious and clearly fresh ingredients were used.
We spent $200 in this place and left hungry and very disappointed.
The decor is night tho...but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling...its quite un-appetizing, and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern.
in an effort to increase turnover, the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary espresso cup filled with chocolate mousse.
by dinner time, they turn it around and mount a huge comeback!!
My husband and I both ordered the Steak, medium.
because the waiters need SEVERE ATTITUE ADJUSTMENTS.
Great value for the quality ingredients.
I got hair in my food 2 times of then !
Go for the Seafood Paella for two.
Growing up in NY, I have eaten my share of bagels.
kalbi and nebbiolo do work together.
If you want to save some money, don't go here.
Anyways, if you're in the neighborhood to eat good food, I wouldn't waste my time trying to find something, rather go across the street to Tamari.
Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza.
Meal was very expensive for what you get.
Quite frankly, this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried.
Half a chicken with a mountain of rice and beans for $6.25.
I'm in love with the lobster ravioli!
Two words: Free wine.
I HAVE NEVER HAD A BAD MEAL(OR BAD SERVICE )@ PIGALLE.
It was good, but was not what I thought it would be.
I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED!
This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it.
The boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they're perfect for 2 people.
I couldn't reccommend their Godmother pizza any higher.
But too far east!
great neighbhorhood spot.
Fresh, authentic, french cuisine in substantial portions.
Speedy delivers, great food, decent prices, and friendly service combine to ensure an enjoyable repast.
this restaurant is absolutely beautiful.
There are many Thai places in the city but so far Toons is #1.
Priced at upper intermediate range.
I went there after hearing how great it was.
I am surprised at the lower reviews because it is definitely better than other places I have tried with higher ratings.
I have been to spice three times- twice during lunch and once at dinner.
The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches.
Regardless of whether there are two people or two hundred people ahead of you the hostess will take your name and tell you Five minutes.
The quantity is also very good, you will come out satisfied.
I don't get it either.
If you go to Roth's try to be served by Mike, he is GREAT!!
I stumbled upon this great pizzeria as I explored my new neighborhood.
Don Pedro's is one of my favorite restaurants.
First walking in the place seemed to have great ambience.
We all felt it was worth it.
Service is top notch.
Sushi experience was unbelievable with my fiance.
The nakgi-bokum was horrible.
They specialize in smoothies and fresh juices.
When I called this morning, I didn't think I would be able to get in at 12, but I was able to get in, along with four other guests.
The menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them.
Joe's Pizza used to have the best slice until this pizzeria opened up.
You would think they would make up for it with service, sadly, no.
We were seated promptly in close proximity to the dance floor.
The waiter was attentive, the food was delicious and the views of the city were great.
A few tips: skip the turnip cake, roast pork buns and egg custards.
However, I do not understand the extraordinary hype about this restaurant.
You don't go to Mizu for excellent service, you go for the large amounts of food, the amiable atmosphere, and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place.
Service is not exactly five star, but thats not really a big deal.
The food was not fresh, the sauces were bland and very oily.
I loved it.
The service was extremely fast and attentive(thanks to the service button on your table) but I barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order.
The dinner was ok, nothing I would have again.
The place is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere.
Coming from Boston this place is like Emma's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge (although they have more funky toppings!)
As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited.
The bartender on my most recent visit was so incredibly rude that I will never go back.
Yeah Shanghai is also great but not quite as good -- they use the same amount of salt but without sweetness to balance out.
Best Indian Chinese in the city, by far!
It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects.
The ambiance was pretty cool, but not worth the hassle.
sandwiches tho pricey are over stuffed - can serve 2 persons easily thus cost effective!
Don't be fooled by crowds of people.
Since it literally is a complete hole in the wall, it's a bit intimidating at first, but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you - don't hesitate to ask for help with what to get.
I am Indian, and I have tried many Indian places in NY.
Unfortunately, the food was NOT something to get worked up about.
And the staff is also young, energeic and hot!!!!
We refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore.
Moderate prices.
excellent tapas at great prices, romantic, small but not overly crowed, excellent
We will be back.
It's popular w/the late crowd.
The space is a bit too small for live music, so on  jazz nights, it can be loud and cramped.
I've never been treated so rudely.
I would go back.
Get the feeling they settled into a groove a while ago.
A nice space, as long as it doesn't get too crowded and a singleminded devotion to its chosen cuisine make Mare a great choice for seafood lovers.
I'd definitely recommend this little place.
This place was not ALL THAT!
The food was just awful, ATROCIOUS actually.
We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai.
they were able to squeeze me in at 6 after i called the night before my anniversary for a friday night reservation and told me they'd treat us well for the occasion.
We generally like good restaurants and eat out often but Kai was way to expensive for what we got.
My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time!
Ambience is so cute and quaint, good for business although we were there on vacation.
For those that go once and don't enjoy it, all I can say is that they just don't get it.
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible.
BUt their best dish is thh Thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a dish that would cost $23.95 is most places, but it is $16 here.
Definately check it out!!!
Service was wonderful;
Pizza here is consistently good.
How have I never been to Agave before?
the bestt!
What generous portions!
She lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy.
Service was prompt, friendly and great.
Have recommended the place to friends, always gets good response.
Yes, I ate the food, but I certainly would not have if I had seen the maggot before eating, and I was at this point fairly sick to my stomach.
The meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too.
He can't help, they're bought up so fast.
And the food was fantastic.
While this isn't classical restaurant fare, the chef has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely Indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burn-outs.
Although, one night we went it was super cheesy, and another night it was less cheesy.
The food is all-around good, with the rolls usually excellent and the sushi/sashimi not quite on the same level.
But after last night, Spice Grill is the only place I'm eating indian cuisine.
Everything looks great, the drinks, the decor, the food, even the people.
I would highly recommend Nina's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming surrounding filled with candles and family pictures.
Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there.
Of course the reason its so packed is because the food is so delicious!
The wine list is extensive and impressive.
How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me.
The restaraurant is very small so reservations are a must.
I have known about this secret for the last 13 years, Emilio(the Godfather) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices.
Went to Village last night for my birthday.
Wonderful at holiday time.
I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try.
The food was absolutely amazing!!
Overall a disappointing experience for that price category.
I went to Kitchenette this weekend for brunch.
The fried dumplings are GREAT!
Great idea and base for restaurant, but work on the details, people who think this was good need to go back to the shore towns and rethink what it should have tasted like.
I thought this place was totally overrated.
One of the more authentic Shanghainese restaurants in the US definitely the best in Manhattan Chinatown.
I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan.
I have to say that if this what makes it easier to get a saet a lunch- I dont mind.
As a Japanese native, I've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years, but I was just so amazed at this place.
The main downside to the place is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level.
Great friendly service, Fast seating, Fast Delivery, Excellent sushi.
Whether one pizza place is better than another is often very subjective.
I almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded.
The restaurant could use a little paint, but all in all a great sushi place!
I really didn't know what to expect for a restaurant that literally overlooks the main hall of Grand Central.
With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care.
Next time, we wouldn't dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks.
I'll being with a couple of positives: cool decor, good pita and hummus, and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty.
Given the incredible architecture surrounding it, this place has no character.
The service was great as well.
However, the service is absolutely horrible.
The dim sum however was very good.
Ok, for all of us growing up in the Village of NYC, we have spoiled by a plethora of restaurants, most of which stay open very late.
All of the apetizers are good and the Sangria is very good.
OK, I've been to Dumont a few times now.
I am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded.
The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water.
The menu consisted of standard brassiere food, better then places like Balthazar etc.
My friends and I have been going here regularly for two years.
Creative, consistent, fresh.
Were meeting up with some friends for a drink at Lafayette 161 and happened to walk by Thai Angel famished.
The ingredients taste fresher, the crust is thinner and crispier, the slice is less oily, and it's never burnt like it occasionally is at Joe's.
This is a true gem of the village.
Moderate prices.
(Besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city).
like saying her bread comes from a special bakery when we have seen her buying it dowtown manhathan.
What a great place!
Really, I find it rather scandalous that such a crappy restaurant attracts such crowds--this, in the city of a million restaurants, at least 9/10 of which are way better than this one.
The staff offers impeccable service.
We ended up having to just leave because we were essentially being ignored by the wait staff--even though the rest of the restaurant was largely empty.
This place has the best pizza.
Deliveries often take up to an hour and the prices are higher than most other pizzerias in the area.
The steak is good, the fish is good and the sushi was surprisingly great.
The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini.
Subtle food and service
They're terrific!!
We left, never to return.
The crispy chicken wasn't for us, though.
$20 for all you can eat sushi cannot be beaten.
Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store.
the real kicker of the menu, however, is the beef cubes or the chicken with chili and lemon grass.
We visited Orsay during NY Restaurant Week and tried their $35 menu.
I loved it and would go again.
No thanks!!!
Finally, after all the raving I went to check it out with one of my enthusiastic friends this last Saturday night and let me tell you its all its cracked up to be.
We didn't even see a menu, as our waiter described both the specials and the main dishes.
Great food, great drinks, nice dining atmosphere.
I REALLY ENJOYED THE SHOWS PUT ON BY THE ACTORS.
The ambience was nice, but service wasn't so great.
Dip the ingredients in with your chopsticks, swirl them around, and eat.
The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale.
The food is amazing!!!!
We were very pleasantly surprised.
We were offered water for the table but were not told the Voss bottles of water were $8 a piece.
We weren't!
We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods.
We weren't even at our table for more than an hour total.
Everytime my husband and I go there, we are never disappointed.
My chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin.
Anyway, this is the last time I cross the williamsburg.
I've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times, but more often I order delivery.
For $600 ( the most we have ever paid) not even waving a magic wand will ever get us back for a repeat performance.
Sometimes you pay a lot and don't get much in return - it's manhattan, things are expensive.
The staff was extremely friendly and pleasant.
While it's not Nobu, it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full.
I had Filet Mignon with garlic mash.
A beef Consomme.
.the best I've found outside of the Chinatown masters.
Satay is one of those favorite haunts on Washington where the service and food is always on the money.
LLOOVVE THIS PLACE.
Chef Vincenzo, always there if you need him, is a real talent and a real Roman.
Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant.
We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful.
And even with it's Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too!
This is, by far, my favorite restaurant in NYC and I only wish it were more affordable so I could go more often!
The service was excellent - friendly and attentive.
If this restaurant was in Manhattan, I would definitely go more often.
We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche.
All my co-workers were amazed at how small the dish was.
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice.
No apologies during restaurant week.
great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer.
Definitely worth the trip to Battery Park City!
The Steak Tartare is a great bet, they fix it for you at the table.
I didn't go there for food so I can't comment.
The staff makes you feel at home, the food is great and the atmosphere is WONDERFUL!
I've been frequenting The Tasting Room since it first arrived in the East Village and I've never been disappointed.
This big draw is the all you can sushi here for $19.95!
The flavors robust and subtle.
Immediately after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys are outta here.
From the incredible food, to the warm atmosphere, to the friendly service, this downtown neighborhood spot doesn't miss a beat.
Montparnasse's desserts--especially the silken creme brulee and paper-thin apple tart--are good enough on their own to make the restaurant worth the trip.
Service is fast and friendly.
but still my date was bad
I do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy.
I LOVE their Thai
Our friends have not arrived yet.
But nonetheless--great spot, great food.
The owner and staff go to great lengths to make you feel comfortable.
The staff are attentive, and have smiles on their faces.
Enjoy!
Every time I have a special occasion with my boyfriend I have a hard time going anywhere else.
Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.
Its worth the wait though.
I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst.
I absolutely Loved this place.
My personal favorite is Nick and Joe's.
I have enjoyed everything I have ever gotten and the fish is so fresh and always prepared in a great way.
Wow over 100 beers to choose from.
I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of.
The food's as good as ever.
It will be on my to do list the next visit to NYC.
The frizzy retro girl (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink. 
But too far east!
The food there is so good that even to order out the wait is incredible.
Visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews.
My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary, and to our surprise it was fantastic.
Restaurant snobs need not bother, this is a small, neighborhood kind of place.
came here for restaurant week, didn't save much, but it was still great.
I'm told that it is open 24hrs which is good.
It's the conversations that make this a fun place to be.
Even upon delivery, their juicy pork buns are quite good . .
Nevertheless the food itself is pretty good.
They are tasty, but I suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average American digestive system.
But the meals were terrible.
Try sushimi cucumber roll.
Yes, the prices are high, but I felt it was worth it.
Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids.
The New York Times has reviewed this place three times already, you know it's going to be good.
When we stumbled on Leon, we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT, we were certainly wrong.
Like others have said, don't expect the restaurant to make a nite out romantic for you and yes, a busy restaurant may require you to wait.
Slightly on the pricey side but worth it!
When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.
but when we looked at the menu, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section.
I haven't eat a lamb chop as delicious as that,the salads are really nice dressed with lemon and extra virgnin olive oil.
The Thali was small, thoroughly unremarkable, and $14.95.
moral stay away.
and you can't beat the prices.
Also, the hostess called me today to thank us for coming and mentioned how she hoped that my girlfriend enjoyed her birthday - unexpected, but a truly above and beyond thing to do...
All in all the food was above average and I would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners.
However, if you want great food at a great price and don't mind the decor, you can't beat this place.
After a seafood craving, i checked citysearch and chose to go to Fish based on a previous review and the citysearch info.
If you want Americanized Chinese food with your usual watery, generic white sauce, this is your place.
We all ordered different entrees so we could share.
Orsay, is a very pleasnt throw back to traditional French food, and French service as well.
The prices are about $9 for an entree for dinner and even less for lunch.
The food is yummy, especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries.
If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you'll love it here.
Don't waste money on decor.
Our experience did not ever get any better.
Get your food to go, find a bench, and kick back with a plate of dumplings.
15% gratuity automatically added to the bill.
Go spend your money somewhere that really wows you.
I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine!
The music does get a little loud at times, but it just made me want to lean closer to my beautiful wife, and as I did, I got a whiff of corriander.
Excellent dumplings served amid clean, chic decor.
For a savory take on the soup and sandwich meal, try the hot and sour soup.
The ambience was nice, but service wasn't so great.
Over 100 different choices to create your own.
The wait staff is pleasant, fun, and for the most part gorgeous (in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way, not in that she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b@#$* way).
The sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the rasamalai was forgettable.
Best In ALL of NYC
Shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here: simple contract, deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20.
Another welcome addition to the neighborhood.
We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday, and I was thoroughly impressed with the food.
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly.
There was a long wait for a table outside, but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice.
Most of the booths allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like 'that' couple.
Service is usually pretty good.
If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go.
I would never wait for a table to eat, it just is not THAT great.
But for the Shabu Shabu, you won't find much better in NY.
I'll be back for sure.
Service is known for bending over backwards to make everyone happy.
Please save yourself the frustration.
We, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude.
The all you can eat deal is truly amazing here.
Enjoy!!!
the food is delicious and highly recommended.
The wine list is interesting and has many good values.
Guess the 555Soul ads didn't launch her big modeling career.
I come from a family of pizzeria owners, and I'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in Fornino's blows my families receipies away.
It's one of our favorite places to eat in NY.
The service is awful.
This isn't a value joint.
You'll see a lot of people eating there after church.
The lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it.
All of my co-workers stated that the food was amazing and wondered why they hadn't heard about this place.
Our server was very helpful and friendly.
This is one of the best comfort food places in the city.
Drinks way over priced.
The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water.
To me it exemplifies Soho, cute, artsy, interesting.
Entrees: Vanison steak and Bison Steak.
Fabulous food - if the front of house staff don't put you off – 
Great Indian food and the service is incredible.
The decor is very simple but comfortable.
I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork.
I recommend their Pad See Ew, Pork Chops or Tofu plates.
Another great thing about Glechik-everything is very cheap!
The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive.
The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded, but the service is excellent and it's great for friends out, a romantic date, or a special occassion.
Has the warmth of a family local yet it is a great place to watch sporting events.
The unattractive lighting made me want to gag, the food was overpriced, there was the most awful disco pop duo performing-and my escargot looked like it might crawl off the plate.
The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu, present your meal, and attend to your needs.
The freshest, best variety, and the fastest delivery.
Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience.
I've been there a few times, and I usually end up sitting next to some pretty odd people.
The food is expensive, but worth every bite.
