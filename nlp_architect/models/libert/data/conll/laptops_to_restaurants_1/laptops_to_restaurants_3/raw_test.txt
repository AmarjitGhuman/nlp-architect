great taste
Service- friendly and attentive.
Going to Ballato's is like coming home and eating in my own kitchen, an absolute delight!
The service is good and the resturant is clean.
After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner.
I had Filet Mignon with garlic mash.
The Cypriot restaurant has a lot going for it.
Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable, makes students go back to Suan again and again.
This is the best Italian restaurant in the city.
It's a small cute restaurant.
After hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant, and passing by it on a daily basis, we decided to try.
The place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening.
This is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together.
Try the ribs, sizzling beef and couple it with coconut rice.
Always busy but fast moving.
The food arrived 20 minutes after I called, cold and soggy.
BTW, the service is very good .
I seriously doubt I will ever dine at Jimmy's Bronx, or for that matter, Jimmy's Uptown, again.
The wait staff is pleasant, fun, and for the most part gorgeous (in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way, not in that she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b@#$* way).
I absolutely Loved this place.
Look foward to trying the Ruben upon returning.
The food is all-around good, with the rolls usually excellent and the sushi/sashimi not quite on the same level.
I recommend that you try this hidden spot which will surely blowup very soon
More Williamsburg Garbage
I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst.
Since we were already waiting so long, we felt we had no other choice but to accept it.
If you are going for the food, it will not be worth it.
It was totally overpriced- fish and chips was about $15.... 
This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls.
The lone argentine chorizo appetizer at $8.95 was a heavy fennel flavored Italian sausage like the ones that sell for $2.99/lb at the store.
I have been to Rao's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better.
Service has always been friendly and efficient.
In such a crappy part of town to find a good value for lunch, this place is great.
Especially liked chicken tikka and the naan, and the dals.
You can also special order any kind of dumpling,etc.
There was a heat problem to boot, so it was about 40 degrees in the restaurant -- we had to request to uncheck our coats!
The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate.
I must give it Yon out of Yon stars!
We will be back.
As soon as my father lifted his pen from the check a chef appeared to usher us out.
Much more reasonably priced too!
I also ordered the Change Mojito, which was out of this world.
Try green curry with vegetables.
P.S. Please don't tell anyone in my family i eat there.
Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet, where greasy, dry and tasteless are complimentary.
The food options rule.
So, if yo really don't care who is sittingnext to you, which is about 2 inches away, I would say try it.
Only complaint is the pricing--I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu.
My wife and I went to Orsay for Valentine's dinner.
But that wasn't the icing on the cake: a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had.
I will be out with friends and all of a sudden I am hungry and I only crave one thing... their Pizza.
Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment.
Myagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the City; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else.
Alias is warm and cozy and you don't get that squished-in feeling you get at 71 Clinton.
Zero ambiance to boot.
Looking around, I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant, not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen.
uni from maine vs california, sea vs freshwater eel) to get a good taste comparison.
However, it was worth the visit.
great wine list (italian), good food, service was INITIALLY fine.
In terms of the food itself -- nothing special, we limited ourselves to several appetizers.
Please save yourself the frustration.
The wine list is interesting and has many good values.
My wife I lived on the west side and found this while visiting firends on the UES.
Went to this place this place on a real cold night and needed a quick meal.
Service is known for bending over backwards to make everyone happy.
Have the iced tea.
The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that  I could barely eat it, and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish.
Yeah, sometimes the service can be slow.
The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal.
The filet mignon dish was superb!
I am going to the mid town location next.
The waiter was attentive.
Try the sea bass.
Ravioli was good...but I have to say that I found everything a bit overpriced.
We were exploring Grand Central and didn't want to eat in the food court.
great food, lt's of it, more then one person can eat!
They all know you.
While the food was excellent, it wasn't cheap (though not extremely expensive either).
Great neighborhood joint.
The pizza is overpriced and soggy.
The two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place.
Result (red velvet): Great texture, soft and velvety, nice hint of cocoa.
Turned out there was full service upstairs and sat down.
My friend from Milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian.
What more can you ask for?
The bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the "free" appetizer of olives was disappointing.
The entree was also very good.
Even the pasta is delicious here (a rarity in New York pizza restaurants).
It's easy to get a table for a large group and you don't get hustled out.
Food was okay, nothing great.
Of course this atmosphere is lacking, but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel place anyways?
The service is great, my soup always arrives nice and hot.
Rao is a good restaurant, but it's nothing special.
Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.
However it is the ONLY Taiwanese restaurant in town.
Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff.
It also has lots of other Korean dishes that are affordable and just as yummy.
Sauce was watery and the food didn't have much flavor.
They are located off the beaten path but are certainly worth the trip.
Here's the thing, you're in the best city in the world for restaurants.
This restaurant was recommended by a local...as a matter of fact, he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed!
great for a romantic evening, or a fun evening with friends...
While there's a decent menu, it shouldn't take ten minutes to get your drinks and 45 for a dessert pizza.
It's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early.
The baked clams octopus we shared as appetizers were the best we've ever had!! 
Even upon delivery, their juicy pork buns are quite good . .
Everything a NY pizza joint should be.
Food took some time to prepare, all worth waiting for.
Not what I would expect for the price and prestige of this location.
fresh restaurant was amazing........ food was delicious and of course fresh.
The photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real look.
Oh yes, and they lie on the phone, claiming they have seating in the garden, then of course the seats are not available.
Make sure you have the Spicy Scallop roll.. .
I found the food, service and value exceptional everytime I have been there.
However, our main course was wonderful.
Very good wine choices.
After reading the posts, I was always skeptical to go to The Minnow, despite living in Park Slope.
The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions.
This place is incredibly tiny.
The food is great, I love their dumplings, cold sesame noodles, chicken and shrimp dishs.
Their exotic salad is basic ly a delcious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu.
Planet Thai is great!
It doesn't look like much on the outside, but the minute you walk inside, it's a whole other atmosphere.
The waitstaff is solicitous and friendly and always seems glad to see us, and the food is wonderful, if not stunningly creative.
Skip this location and go to the one in Soho.
The food is flavorful, plentiful and reasonably priced.
I will be back!
I've overheard comments from him to his employees that should not have been delivered in the dining area and I've been sitting there while he lectured another customer.
The ambience was so fun, and the prices were great, on top of the fact that the food was really tasty.
I like the somosas, chai, and the chole, but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing.
The atmosphere is great!!!
I am going to the mid town location next.
If you're into being lost when you're just five feet from your table then hey, that's a good thing.
As I made the title, it's an affordable restaurant for great taste.
Try the tandoori salmon!
I didn't complain, I liked the atmosphere so much.
Just because P Diddy had a party at Butter doesn't mean we should be automatically impressed.
The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food.
Good for dates or with friends.
I choose to go with one of the special, the braised lamb shank in red wine, which was excellent.
Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood.
It's just everything...the food, the atmosphere...the incrediby kind and gracious hostess.
Suan is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too.
It was delicious and large!
This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets, with that certain Parisian flair.
This is my fourth try over a two year period, and I'm done.
I've been many time and have never been disappointed.
I recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal!
No free drink.
The place is absolutely adorable and the food is delicious.
The food here does a great service to the name (Cantonese that is...).
Also get the Onion Rings -- best we've ever had.
Can't wait wait for my next visit.
Best of all is the warm vibe, the owner is super friendly and service is fast.
We started with lox and mussels (the best ive ever had, ever) and had the cod and trout for dinner.
The seafood is amazing, there's a good wine list, and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises.
This is the pinnacle of Indian Fast Food (all fast foods in my opinion).
As much as I like the food there, I can't bring myself to go back.
The boutique selection of wines covers a wide variety without being imposeing.
The cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee!!
Not to sound too negative but be wary of the delivary.
My boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque.
the food was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining.
I have to say I have never had a disapointing meal here.
I've eaten thai many times, and am very familiar with the cuisine.
The bagels are also reasonably priced for NYC.
The jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes.
Best Indian Chinese in the city, by far!
sometimes i get bad food and bad service, sometimes i get good good and bad service.
On the recommendation of a friend, I checked out Arezzo with my wife.
The only drawback is that it's a little pricey.
The staff isn't the friendliest or most competent, and I am stickler for service, but everything else about this place makes up for it.
Needless to say, I'm never going back and you should be wary too.
The staff is very good.
amazing fresh dogs but best of all endless toppings!!!
It saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy, crowded bar at dinnertime.
An excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but, the food was slightly disappointing.
But, nothing stands out about the cooking.
Being serious sushi lovers, we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action.
Please be aware that it's CASH or AMEX only!
Avoid at all costs.
The food is consistant and good but how it got name Best Diner In Manhattan is beyond me.
I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A. Being serious sushi lovers, we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action.
Authentic Pakistani food.
Of course the reason its so packed is because the food is so delicious!
The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini.
Be careful of portions - they're HUGE.
Nothing against a good sales call, but the tactics at Amma are just too obvious.
Stumbled upon this gem of a pizza place and I will be going back frequently.
Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
i've been back to nha trang literally a hundred times for the beef cubes - they're that good.
The food is great, service is ok.
This place, however, has a lot less pretension than Joya and the Thai food is still above-average.
Rao is a good restaurant, but it's nothing special.
First, the waiter who served us neglected to fill us in on the specials, which I would have chosen had I known about them.
The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water.
Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you're with.
Their Margarita is best I've had since I've returned from Naples!
We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it.
The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals.
THe back garden sitting area is very pleasant, where you can see their personal herb garden.
I have been to Casimir over 5 times and I have always had a great time there.
This was the perfect quiet, relaxing, and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater.
There was a great deal for 6 Blue Point oysters and a beer or glass of wine for $8!
Try everything for that matter, it is all good.
bottles of wine are cheap and good.
I have tried literally every restaurant on curry row.
Food is usually very good, though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders.
Love Pizza 33..
The owner and staff go to great lengths to make you feel comfortable.
This is a consistently great place to dine for lunch or dinner.
And its absolutely DELICIOUS.
I didn't expect to like Nosh as much as I did, but the pastrami on challah sandwich I had was otherworldly, the soups are like Mom's, and the knishes give Yonah Schimmel's a run for its money.
personally i say save your money.
The lunch special is an asbolute steal.
I went to Ruby Foo's after work with a group of 6.
Inside is a little cramped, but to be expected.
Volare virgins or weekly regulars, everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly.
I have dined at Mammino several times now and each time it gets bettter.
Stepping into Casa La Femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in New York!
Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best, freshly baked bread!
I've been to at Cafe Spice probably 5-8 times, it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square.
Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all.
The sauces used are also not that exciting.
This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent.
She was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about Indian food.
Make sure you have the Spicy Scallop roll.. .
Although, one night we went it was super cheesy, and another night it was less cheesy.
This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money.
Sushi wasn't anything spectacular for the price.
This is a fun restaurant to go to.
The wine selection (by the glass and bottle) is wonderful and I always recommend that friends make a reservation if they're going to be in town.
David, Daytona Beach, FL
My Chelsea's impressive and creative menu includes modern, Westernized Japanese dishes such as Foie Gras Unagi Napolean, Jap style hamburger steak, spicy cod roe spaghetti, black cod with miso base, and rack of lamb in black truffle sauce, to name a few.
Food is great.
Faan's got a great concept but a little rough on the delivery.
This is such a lovely, peaceful place to eat outside.
The waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet, we were told no...
Small servings for main entree, i had salmon (wasnt impressed) girlfriend had chicken, it was good.
I completely recommend Casa La Femme for any special occasion and to REALLY impress your date.
I got the opportunity to dine at your establishment again a few weeks ago, I was in your upstrairs dining area.
A great addition to Smith Street: finally, a place that's not pretentious and filled with women wearing Ugg boots.
We've lived in the area for more than 8 years.
If you’re planning to come here, make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you’ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching (choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky!).
This place is a must visit!
Three of us arrived for dinner about 5:30 on a week night without reservations.
Excellent atmosphere, delicious dishes good and friendly service.
But $1 for each small piece???
I went here with a friend on a whim, we went someplace else first and couldn't get a table.
When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently 
I cannot imagine you not rushing out to eat there.
So rude!!!
The one vegetarian entree (Abby's treasure) was actually quite a surprise - it was delicious and had wintermelon covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables.
The bibimbap was average, but the stone bowl wasn't even close to sizzling.
Inexpensive, unassuming, great time!
Also, don't plan on asking for your favorite roll, if it's not on the menu, you can't have it.
JUST AWSOME.
They honored reservation on Sunday afternoon very well. 
Again, if you are in this neighborhood - by all means, come here.
If you're craving some serious indian food and desire a cozy ambiance, this is quite and exquisite choice.
Bagels are ok, but be sure not to make any special requests!
I have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo; you can tell it was a fresh lobster.
i've noticed megadeth, mr. scruff, st. germain, traditional vietnamese songs, black sabbath, jay-z, and daft punk all being played.
They outshine HH.
A little crowded but they move that line really fast!
I didn't go there for food so I can't comment.
And the bill was outragous.
I'm just reading some of these reviews and its nonsense that people are reviewing some places because it was too loud.
Highly recommended!
Creative, consistent, fresh.
This place is worth an one-hour drive.
Definitely will be back!
I live in the West Village and I've been to a lot of restaurants.
Fast service.
Lahore is a great place to duck into late-night when you need some really tasty food on the cheap -- you'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for FOUR DOLLARS.
So I've never actually been to M proper, but I've had it delivered a few times.
Although the tables may be closely situated, the candle-light, food-quality and service overcompensate.
The counter service is bad.
If you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave.
The lox is always fresh too.
my picks are:  - Scallion Pancake (fried with vegetable juice, very special and tasty)  - Guizhou Chicken  - Shredded Squid Family Style (one of my personal favorites)  - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab  - Shuizhu Fish (this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans, I wouldn't recommend to my American friends as it's very spicy.
Would definitely go back again.
Have been several times and it never dissapoints.
Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room (no matter what the size of your party), the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters- you'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you're in.
Filled with suits, though, so you never really feel terribly comfortable.
I would highly recommend this place!
Their sushi, Kamikaze and other Rolls are fresh and well presented.
I ordered the chu chu curry and my friend ordered the pad thai chicken.
It was delish and I didn't feel bad eating it.
Although I moved uptown I try to stop in as often as possible for the GREAT cheap food and to pay the friendly staff a visit.
Great pizza and fantastic service.
The food was as creative as the decor and both worked.
It's better than being on the roof of Sutton Place with 19 year old interns jabbing you in the ribs all night.
It is not a place for tourists or someone who has never dined in Bay Ridge.
Best Taiwanese food in NY!
and the owner is simply lovely and friendly.
The owner is very friendly and a great guy, go try his pizza, you'll like it!
Looking around, I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant, not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen.
Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.
Nice for one time special occasion.
i don't usually order wine with indian so i can't comment on their wine list or their wines.
If you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great food and excellent service, this is the place.
I wasn't there for the Half-Price Saturday Night Special, but Tuesday Night.
Walk-ins are risky too.
While most people can attest to spending over $50 on drinks in New York bars and hardly feeling a thing, the drinks here are plentiful and unique.
Not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring.
I would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard.
It was divine melts in your mouth.
We paid and left because we didn't feel like arguing any more.
Had a lovely dinner in this dedicated seafood joint, food was well-prepared and -presented and the service was pleasant and prompt.
The all-Italian staff is warm and engaging from the start.
Try the crunchy tuna, it is to die for.
I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night.
Waitstaff are very friendly.
Nicky the Nose at the bar is a treat.
We got in line and were served while in line a bannan fritter.
I complained to the waiter and then to the manager, but the intensity of rudeness from them just went up.
The portions are HUGE, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and entree per person) for two people.
After we ate our appetizers (which took all of 8 minutes) we ordered another round of Brahma's - and tried to stall a little as we waited for our sixth dinner member. 
We love it, and took buses and cabs to get there.
We concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake, both were delicious.
The catch is that you are charged extra for ANYTHING that you leave on your plate so don't be a greedy pig!
Moderate prices.
The bagel was huge.
Don't miss Bloom's on your next trip to Manhatten.
It had been awhile and I forgot just how delicious crepes can be.
but when we looked at the menu, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section.
Boy was I wrong!
I have never eaten in the restaurant, however, upon reading the reviews I got take out last week.
You can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience, but for superb food at reasonable prices, La Villa can't be beat.
The lox is always fresh too.
Was her Monday for lunch - was working on a film in the area - and found this rare jewel.
The service varys from day to day- sometimes they're very nice, and sometimes not.
Very affordable and excellent ambient!
Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation.
awesome
ALWAYS full with tourists (especially because of it's close proximity to Rockefeller Center).
I think the restaurant was too loud (when full) to be romantic.
In the evening, this place attracted a well dressed, with it, NY crowd.
The space is a bit too small for live music, so on  jazz nights, it can be loud and cramped.
We, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude.
I wasn't impressed and it wasn't SPICEY????
Most importantly, food is excellent.
Most of the booths allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like 'that' couple.
When we were finally seated our waitress came by twice-1 for our order and 2-for our check.
The service is awful.
I can't wait for summer, when they serve outside on their gigantic patio.
Plus, on Wednesday nights the house wine is unlimited!
Their twist on pizza is heatlhy, but full of flavor.
Everything that happened was not even up to mediocre.
i would recommend reservations on weekends though.
We concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake, both were delicious.
They all know you.
The ambiance was pretty cool, but not worth the hassle.
When I got there the place was packed but they made sure to seat me quickly.
Oh, don't even let me start with how expensive the bills were!
I would go back.
The crab cakes are delicious and the BBQ rib was perfect.
Highly recommended is the Spicy Fried Clam Rolls and Spider Rolls.
At first i was rolling my ideas of yet another French place on the UES.
I went here for a family birthday dinner. 
A narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters, a great deal of mess (stacks of bottles, cans) and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees.
I've been a regular customer at Juice Generation for the last 3 months - my office moved to the Film Center on Ninth Avenue and they are on the next block.
I book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot.
And it was quick which is very important.
Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
Went there for a special celebration.
lobster was good, nothing spectacular.
And where does Patis go wrong; no where. 
They even scoop it out nice (for those on a diet) not too much not to little.
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category.
I don't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer.
A few tips: skip the turnip cake, roast pork buns and egg custards.
Service was good and food is wonderful.
Whether your choose the iced blended mocha or the hot white mocha you are sure to be extremely happy.
They do cater to American palates, but if you like it hot let them know and they are more than willing to oblige!
The food is nothing like its menu description.
Not someplace I would seek to try out but if I am in the area again, I will certainly stop by.
The service was great, and they have a whole great deal for birthdays.
We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and will be going back for the desserts ....
We had fun eating in there, we were there like around 3 a.m. in the morning!
I went there with a few friends and will return.
The most annoying thing, though, is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue.
They don't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai.
We had a very nice time.
i would just ask for no oil next time.
Stay away from this place.
For dinner I had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan.
We order a bit of everything on the menu.
They used shredded cheese on top!
Delivery is fast too.
Went here on a friend's reccomendation.
Though it's been crowded most times I've gone here, Bark always delivers on their food.
She just nodded and walked off.
Well...they can run but they can't hide.
My husband had the mesclun, salmon, and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses.
I came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband.
We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order.
I know real Indian food and this wasn't it.
I thought this place was totally overrated.
I found the food to be outstanding, particulary the salmon dish I had.
Lucky Strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat.
No food snobs allowed, this place is for people who appreciate good food.
If you've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer.
There is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me.
I had a terrific meal, and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range, instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that wasn't as good.
Pizza was a little soggy.
The appetizers are ok, but the service is slow.
Ive passed by the spot tons of times always wanting to go in.
We did have to wait at the bar for approx.
This place is always very crowded and popular.
strike up a conversation with the attorney next to you, or with the local union worker on the other side.
we have been there 3 times since last week we alked it by chance first day the manager offerd us the margherita pizza adn we said yes.
In summer-eat outside on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!
I highly recommend the Sophia pizza.
I wish they would change back to what it was before.
We've lived in the area for more than 8 years.
Terrific menu full of unique rolls and special dishes.
I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read.
i especially like their soft shell crab sandwich with fries.
The food was average to above-average; the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive, and the desserts not brilliant in any way.
I would never wait for a table to eat, it just is not THAT great.
Despite the fact that the space is large, they've overcrowded the floor with tables.
($200 for 2 glasses of champagne, not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks).
Found service above average, but that could be because we were 13 of us.
I don't remember what we had; nothing was memorable.
The closest that I got was the Cherry Marscapone, but they were out of it that day.
This place is to be avoided.
We waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right.
NO more reservations, expensive tips and annoying stuff.
Pizza is terrific, as is homemade pasta.
Even the pasta is delicious here (a rarity in New York pizza restaurants).
The pesto pizza was excellent, thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I'd never heard of before.
One thing I liked about this place is that I never felt rushed or pressured to give up my table ot incoming guests.
Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll.
Have eaten at Ginger House several times, and it's always good.
Fish was overdone.
I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine.
I have NEVER been disappointed in the Red Eye.
However, if you want great food at a great price and don't mind the decor, you can't beat this place.
I'm from sichuan, this is the restaurant I recommend going.
First of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review.
Don't go with a larger group than 4! 
Went here last night and had a pleasant experience.
Open late (well as late as I ever got there and I'm a night person)
Though the Spider Roll may look like a challenge to eat, with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll, it is well worth the price you pay for them.
Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting.
When the bill came, nothing was comped, so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine, but I didn't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it.
This wasn't the expected menu comprised only of pad thai and tom yum soup, but I thought that was what made the place so special.
Kudos to Po!
I came to this restaurant expecting to be surprised but left bored and overcharged.
The food was delicious and clearly fresh ingredients were used.
This place is so much fun.
The place is larger than most and features adequate seating unlike most joints, and has a bar which deserves a mention.
Would definitely visit again.
By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant.
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt).
I've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences.
This bar has it all - great drinks, cool atmosphere, excellent service and delicious food.
You should pass on the calamari.
Now it's so crowded and loud you can't even talk to the person next to you.
It took a bigger bite from my wallet than my appetite - I would not reccomend this to anyone that I would want to talk to me again!!
Take a good sense of humor,an American express card with no limit, walk out with a lollipop,gift bag in hand and enough marketing materials for alain to to take the show on the road
Best Italian food I ever had (and being Italian, that means alot).
All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better!
This place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area.
Hands down the best pizza on the planet.
Just moved to the neighborhood and we've been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants.
Food was just average...if they lowered the prices just a bit, it would be a bigger draw.
My roommate and I LOVE this place.
Conveniently located too, being right on Bedford ave.
MY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly!
There is no excuse for such lousy service!
Ambience is so cute and quaint, good for business although we were there on vacation.
I will go back to Suan soon!
Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience.
And I've been to many NYC delis.
Service is average.
The entire place and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt.
It's a small cute restaurant.
The exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations.
After a seafood craving, i checked citysearch and chose to go to Fish based on a previous review and the citysearch info.
Celebrated my fathers birthday here.
Thius is a must for anyone who loves Shabu-Shabu.
My only problem is that you are literally sitting on top of the people next to you!
it is not consistent.
The service was excellent and the food was delicious.
A very inviting restaurant, with friendly service.
Great place to grab a hot bagel on the way to work.
We did tip, I guess the model/waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager.
The DJ is awesome, I have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and I keep going back.
Try the green curry!!!
Usually 3 vs. 4 items per dish.
Finally!
The barebecued salmon is elegantly spiced and not at all dry.
The sushi is always fresh and yummy and the menu is pretty varied.
Bon appettite!!
We were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd.
You can't go wrong here.
I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
The hot dogs were cold in the middle and the buns were stale.
And comparing it to the Chinatown restaurants is simply not fair.
Really Lovely dining experience in the midst of buzzing midtown area.
Over time, the food quality has decreased substantially, it is a lot less crowded than it used to, and the service must definitely be part of the reason.
A nice space, as long as it doesn't get too crowded and a singleminded devotion to its chosen cuisine make Mare a great choice for seafood lovers.
While the room is not particularly comfortable, once you're seated you'll forget about everything except what's on your plate.
Too bad Latin Quarters closed.
Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.
I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere!
However, I do not understand the extraordinary hype about this restaurant.
So much more than the usual bar food, go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their hand-crafted beers.
Its located in greenewich village.
Excellent food for great prices
I went to Swiftys with some friends of the family and we had a very nice dinner, but nothing amazing.
Plus, when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy Saturday night, the owner sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over!
Decent Thai food in cute - though a bit dank - little Nolita hangout, BUT service terrible.
Several of the dim sum orders had about 6-8 pieces.
The restaurant was quiet and intimate.
The omlette for brunch is great...
The one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side.
The $300 bill was a bit steep, but the experience was great.
great toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost!
However, looking at the table next to ours, we both sort of wished we had ordered pizza, which looked PERRRRRRRRRFECT.
All the staff is absolutely professional!! 
Good for a quick sushi lunch.
Best Pastrami I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous.
WE ENDED UP IN LITTLE ITALY IN LATE AFTERNOON.
Restaurant was dirty and unkempt.
Don't get me started on the margaritas, either.
As a Japanese native, I've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years, but I was just so amazed at this place.
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.
They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!
I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled.
i have eaten here on a different occasion - the food is mediocre for the prices.
Has the chef and owner changed???
The atmosphere is nothing special, but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo.
Restaurant snobs need not bother, this is a small, neighborhood kind of place.
I took one bite from the $24 salmon, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.
Owner must have coem on this website to give himself credit.
When he finally did, he was unable to make a gin and tonic -- couldn't find tonic.
I do not recommend lunch specials just because it tasts the same with other regular chinese restaurant.
Fish is so very fresh.
Our first course was Tuna Sashimi with Green Yuzu Sauce.
They never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table.
It's a nice place to relax and have conversation.
I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork.
The wine list isn't great, and the desserts are shipped in from Bruno's down the street, which is not as good as it used to be.
Old school meets New world.
This will be only the third online review I have ever made about a restaurant in my life.
THe back garden sitting area is very pleasant, where you can see their personal herb garden.
This should have been done in a back room - away from customers.
There is a downside if you're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude.
They have authentic Indian at amazin prices.
Definitely something to come down and check out.
Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens, this is among the best.
If only they delivered, they'd make a mint!
This was one of the BEST restaurants I've ever been to.
Not only did they have amazing, sandwiches, soup, pizza etc, but their homemade sorbets are out of this world!
They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great.
I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst.
It is definitely a good spot for snacks and chat.
Delivery can be spot on or lacking depending on the weather and the day of the week.
It is terrific, as is the value.
Every time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street.
No doubt the next time we want to go out for a special occasion or are entertaining guests from out of town, Spirit and Bateaux will be our destination.
This is a twenty-something guy that doesn't mind laying down $300 for a fine and delicious meal for 2 on special occassions.
Have frequented 'ino for several years and the food remains excellent.
Food was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly, but I can say this is one of the best I've had.
And even with it's Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too!
for 7 years they have put out the most tasty, most delicious food and kept it that way...
If you're in the neighborhood, definitely stop by for a great meal.
I just read Mocaramel's review and felt compelled to respond.
Excellent sashimi, and the millennium roll is beyond delicious.
I would definitely go back for a very special occasion, but not for regular fine dining.
I've had the chicken with garlic sauce, chicken with black bean sauce, and hunan chicken.
I've had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times, when I have been in the neighborhood.
Just remember, the later you go, the longer you may have to wait.
Based on the reviews on here, it appears that the restaurant is overwhelmed after the 7 PM.
They might be all business at the counter when you give your order, but their food says I love you.
For great chinese food nearby, you have Wu Liang Ye and Grand Sichuan just a block away.
The dinner was ok, nothing I would have again.
its a little out of the way if you don't live in the neighborhood, but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are.
I had the best ravioli ever.
Not only was the sushi fresh, they also served other entrees allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy (try the duck!
it is a hidden delight complete with a quaint bar and good food.
Staffs are not that friendly, but the taste covers all.
Somewhat disappointing wine list (only new vintages.
In fact, this was not a Nicoise salad and was barely eatable.
This is, by far, my favorite restaurant in NYC and I only wish it were more affordable so I could go more often!
My mom originally introduced me to this place, but even she (being Indian) feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily.
Also, top the meal with a delicious and perfect slice of tiramisu.
The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal.
Unique apppetizers.
its just a fun place to go, not a five star restaraunt.
Not a small feat for good french food in the area.
I went here with my boyfriend and another couple.
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place.
Every time I have a special occasion with my boyfriend I have a hard time going anywhere else.
As there were so many to choose from we wandered up and down the street looking in the windows and such noticicing many empty seats ,except at Taj Mahal.
The prices and ambience are especially great considering it's in the West Village.
Also they were $15 each!
I've been eating at Taj Mahal for over twenty years and have found them to be the most excellent of the Indian eateries on this block of Indian restaurants.
It's also attached to Angel's Share, which is a cool, more romantic bar...
When going out for a nice dinner, I like a nice ambiance as well as very good food.
I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki and my husband got Garlic Shrimp.
My only complaint might be the fortune cookies - I've never had a cookie predict bad luck for me before I visited Kar.
Subtle food and service
If you've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer.
Great burgers, grilled cheeses and french fries.
Yes, they're a bit more expensive then typical, but then again, so is their food.
I recommend it!
The dinner menu is diverse and top-notch as well.
To speak of the Park Side, words can not describe.
Maggot in the food!
I think the pizza is so overrated and was under cooked.
Somewhat pricey but what the heck.
Probably my worst dining experience in new york, and I'm a former waiter so I know what I'm talking about.
Whether one pizza place is better than another is often very subjective.
Stay with the roasted chickens and you'll be fine.
I love the atmorphere @ peep!
The wine is always good, the tapas are always yummy, especially with the warm pita bread.
We thought the dessert would be better, Wrong!
It is not worth for that bucks.
For those that go once and don't enjoy it, all I can say is that they just don't get it.
The wine list is also really nice.
don't get me wrong - sushi was good, just not fantastic.
but overall i give it a 10
From the terrible service, to the bland food, not to mention the unaccommodating managers, the overall experience was horrible.
The service was ok.
Fish was overdone.
The food was amazing, and the service was prompt and helpful, but not over-bearing or rushed.
However, I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once.
This was the perfect quiet, relaxing, and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater.
I read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself, but may be it is worth it.
They tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter, so i'm looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it.
Prices are fair across the board for both food and bev.
Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you.
The decor is night tho...but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling...its quite un-appetizing, and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern.
This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it.
The Italian food has flavor (that can be sort of surprising on the UES), and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive,they sort of remind me of the NY Yankees of the late 90's, no matter how bad it look, you knew that there was a rally just around the corner...
VT is what baby pizzas hope to be when they grow up.
None was made so i hung up.
You must try the shrimp appetizers.
A pleasant surprise.
Dessert - can't be missed, so save room!!!
Good food.
Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant!
Food is always fresh and hot- ready to eat!
I showed it to the manager, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for).
Great wine list, reasonably priced.--Sara
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience.
It was rather pathetic that it took them over an hour to seat us.
Taj Mahal offeres gret value and great food.
We had crawfish boiled and despite making a mess, it was a ton of fun and quite tasty as well.
LOVE the atmosphere - felt like I was in Paris.
For the people who want great food plus great service, Roxy is a place to AVOID!
They charge different prices all the time.
Jimmy is Dominican!
one of the best Chicken Tikka Masala.
Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey.
It is bland and nothing extrodinary.
I also ordered for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the order.
Quick and friendly service.
The corned beef was tender and melted in my mouth.
For those of you who don't know, Uni is Sea Urchin in Japanese, which happens to be my favorite.) 
It is very overpriced and not very tasty.
There is nothing more pleasant than that.
i went in one day asking for a table for a group and was greeted by a very rude hostess.
Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll.
great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer.
Wouldn't recomend it for dinner!
Both the fresh mozzerella slices and the Plain Cheese slice are phenomenal.
They have great rolls, the triple color and norwegetan rolls, are awesome and filling.
Spice is sleek, modern and cool with a menu that will not hurt your wallet.
The food was absolutely amazing!!
Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant!
and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs.
First of all Dal Bukhara Rocks.
On a recent Saturday night, I was with a group of 5 at the Bread Bar.
Whether it's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar, you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite.
and we were thouroughly disapointed.
The parathas and kebabs are made when ordered ensuring a level of freshness that is unsurpassed.
This is definitely one of the places that I have continued to come back to over the years.
this place... we stumbled upon it on labor day weekend.
Appetizer are excellent here; you can make a great (and inexpensive) meal out of them.
Immediately after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys are outta here.
The place does get crowded, so I recommend going between 4-5 PM.
The octopus eaters were floored by the Octopus salad.
We picked it randomly, without a recommendation from someone who has been there, so we weren't sure what to expect.
I highly reccomend the grand marnier shrimp, it's insanely good.
We will be back.
they were dry and disgusting, i didn't even finish my first piece.
The cuisine from what I've gathered is authentic Taiwanese, though its very different from what I've been accustomed to in Taipei.
All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent, but the gyro is the reason to come--if you don't eat one your trip was wasted.
This restaurant is VEGETARIAN; there are NO MEAT dishes whatsoever.
Huge portions, great and attentive service, and pretty good prices.
It first came well done, and I politely sent it back.
Maybe the secret was that we went on a Sunday night and everything was great.
The flavors robust and subtle.
When we walked in it seemed like it was there for 200 years.
The service was attentive, yet unimposing, the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced.
Go with the specials, and stay away from the salmon. 
This was a repeat visit and we'll definitely be back again.
Slightly on the pricey side but worth it!
They forgot a sandwich, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter.
When I called this morning, I didn't think I would be able to get in at 12, but I was able to get in, along with four other guests.
My wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food.
go to any corned indian restaurant, and the little india strip along east 6 st rules supreme!
The atmosphere was mostly of an older crowd, but there were a few groups of mid 20's/30 year olds also.
No green beans, no egg, no anchovy dressing, no nicoise olives, no red onion.
If you are looking for a good quality, cheap eats - this is the place.
Ambience is so cute and quaint, good for business although we were there on vacation.
Not only is this the best Thai restaurant I have been to, but it also ranks as one of my favorite places to dine.
The Sashimi portion are big enough to appease most people, but I didn't like the fact they used artifical lobster meat.
Poor service and management
Then, IF they answer the phone, you're lucky if they don't hang up on you!
We have been to this place many times, and always have great food, wine, and service.
The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner.
too large for just two people but nothing was left.
The hot dogs are top notch, and they're Slamwich is amazing!
In the evening, this place attracted a well dressed, with it, NY crowd.
The vibe is very relaxed and cozy, service was great and the food was excellent!
Although be warned their dinner menu to sit and take out prices are different.
The food is great.
This is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the Basil slice.
Great vibe, lots of people.
Ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me.
Nice value.
I think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation.
Decor leaves something to be desired.
Thank You Emilio.
believe us, we've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs.
The food was outstanding and the service was tops.
Food was OK.
The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach.
Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant.
last Tuesday for a late lunch with a friend.
It was pleasantly uncrowded, the service was delightful, the garden adorable, the food (from appetizers to entrees) was delectable.
The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu, present your meal, and attend to your needs.
Love the scene first off- the place has a character and nice light to it..very fortunate, location wise.
Red Dragon Roll - my favorite thing to eat, of any food group - hands down
People dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans.
Our tiny table for two (dinner plates hung over edge) was right in the middle of one of the lanes of waiter traffic.
I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible.
The food is definitely good, but I left a bit disappointed.
Ask for the round corner table next to the large window.
Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening.
I can't wait to go back.
And the prices were way to high for what you get.
You will not be dissapointed by any of the choices in the menu.
Their sake list was extensive, but we were looking for Purple Haze, which wasn't listed but made for us upon request!
Aside from the bearded, courdoroy blazer professor type with the NYU student he's sleeping with that week, you see a strange mix of hipsters, frat boys, Will Smith types who need to be told they are black, bitter cougars who cant understand why they arent married yet....
This restaurant used to be our regular Thursday night dinner location.
The food's dazzling flavors overwhelm the palate, truly embracing the beauty of authentic Thai cuisine.
It will be on my to do list the next visit to NYC.
It costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice.
Compared to Ess-a, Tal offers a less doughy bagel!
I highly recommend it for not just its superb cuisine, but also for its friendly owners and staff.
All in all the food was above average and I would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners.
Leon is an East Village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic French bistro fare, good specials, a warm and lively atmosphere.
There is actually space to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner.
I wouldn't mind going back some time, but not before trying others nearby.
The room is a little plain, but it's difficult to make such a small place exciting and I would not suggest that as a reason not to go.
Just straight up cheap, good food.
Excellent dumplings served amid clean, chic decor.
Only wine and beer are served, but the house varities are actually quite good.
I WAS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED BY THE FOOD.
When we stumbled on Leon, we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT, we were certainly wrong.
Anywhere else, the prices would be 3x as high!
We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu.
The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual.
They couldn't even make a salad that was appealing.
They specialize in smoothies and fresh juices.
My husband and I have been there at least 6 times and we've always been given the highest service and often free desserts.
I had a grat time at Jekyll and Hyde!
Glechik might be way too tiny for a restaurant by Russian standards, but it is cozy and the food is simply GREAT.
Save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one!
It was good, but was not what I thought it would be.
It's really a takeaway place, I wouldn't sit if I could take it home.
There was only one waiter for the whole restaurant upstairs.
The dim sum servings here are a bit larger than I'm used to.
Stuffing yourself with Japanese food is a rare thing.
If you're looking to taste some great Indian food and want good service, definitely visit Curry Leaf.
Then, to top things off, she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend's jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes. 
The place is clean, and if you like soul food, then this is the place to be!
The food is top notch, the service is attentive, and the atmosphere is great.
We, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude.
If only they delivered, they'd make a mint!
rice dishes and noodle dishes rarely exceed $5 and add on a refreshing ice drink for $2 and you're set for the night!
For the location, the prices are very reasonable.
This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent.
Everything is delicious, though, my gf and I come here once a week sometimes- you will get addicted!
I have taken practically every guest that has come to visit me in NY and hooked a few New Yorkers onto Peep as well.
THE SERVICE IS PERFECT TOO  NOTHING WRONG IN THIS ITALIAN/FRENCH RESTAURANT
Food and service was okay.
I have been to spice three times- twice during lunch and once at dinner.
Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City
service was efficient courteous.
Guacamole+shrimp appetizer was really great, we both had the filet, very good, didn't much like the frites that came with, but the filet was so good, neither of us cared.
And forget what you read under me, the atmosphere isn't that bad either.
It's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend.
The food is great.
Great friendly service, Fast seating, Fast Delivery, Excellent sushi.
Everything is always cooked to perfection, the service is excellent, the decor cool and understated.
Really.
I've waited over one hour for food.
i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family.
You will not be disapointed at all.
This is the best unknown restaurant in and around New York.
It's simply the best meal in NYC.
Authentic Pakistani food.
We have been to Montparnasse many times and return often for good reason.
I LOVE their spicy scallop roll, and my boyfriend consistently gets the sesame chicken.
Deliveries often take up to an hour and the prices are higher than most other pizzerias in the area.
But they do.
Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos.
So rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary!
Its a great place for a casual date or to entertain clients for lunch.
The menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent.
This is the perfect spot for meeting friends, having lunch, dinner, pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks!
Way too much money for such a terrible meal.
food was luke warm.
We went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different.
I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time.
For years, I thought Tuscan cuisine was the best, but Salvatore converted me to the hearty Neapolitan fare on my first visit.
I was very disappointed with this restaurant.
The 'kamasutra' and 'bombay cosmopolitan' are excellent and will have you tipsy in no time.
The food is very good too but for the most part, it's just regular food, nothing special.
However, it's not worth a special trip.
For sure i will keep coming back because i feel really this restaurant deserves.
My entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid, and was unnecessarily heated with a burner.
A guaranteeed delight!
Chinese Desserts are known for healthful benefits in addition to the sweetness.
Great Indian food and the service is incredible.
The pizza was great.
Menus feature seasonal picks, like sweet corn-foie gras brulee.
Priced at upper intermediate range.
The avocado salad is a personal fave.
Service is average.
The food was good overall. 
Unlike other places in NYC where the sandwiches you want only come as a triple-decker, here you can get what you want in a reasonably-sized portion (and price).
then she made a fuss about not being able to add 1 or 2 chairs on either end of the table for additional people.
LLOOVVE THIS PLACE.
big and soft as well as good lunch food.
The website and rating makes this place look wonderful but in reality it was very disappointing.
There were no communications issues either, as she spoke perfect English.
service is friendly, and never had a problem walking in and getting a table.
The staff is very friendly.
Excellent lunch buffet for only $6.95.
An excellent choice in midtown.
While the place is not a hotspot hangout, the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck.
The restaurant is rather small but we were lucky to get a table quickly.
But the staff was so horrible to us.
it's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food.
Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids.
Lunch came with pickels and slaw, no extra charge.
The ceiling is amazing!
The staff greeted me warmly at the door and I was seated promptly and the food was excellent.
The service was mediocre, and the lack of air conditioning made for a less than comfortable meal.
Anytime and everytime I find myself in the neighborhood I will go to Sushi Rose for fresh sushi and great portions all at a reasonable price.
Try the Pad Thai, or sample anything on the appetizer menu...they're all delicious.
The food was delicious, the atmosphere was relaxed, and we have now adopted Plate 347 as our Secret on Second!
You will find yourself returning quite often.
Not only is the food authentic, but the staff here are practically off-the-boat, they are young and hip and know what they are doing when it comes to food and wine.
Great bagels made the old-fashioned way.
The decor is nice, but more casual than fine dining.
We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu.
You cannot go wrong at the Red Eye Grill.
The food is delicious and beautifully prepared along with the friendly and personable service.
I had roast chicken and a salad.
Good luck getting a table.
They are the best bagels I've had.
The entire dining experience was wonderful!
We would return to this place again!
Orsay, is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic French food in NYC.
This is such a lovely, peaceful place to eat outside.
The place has a nice fit-out, some attractive furnishings and, from what I could tell, a reasonable wine list (I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins)
Guess the 555Soul ads didn't launch her big modeling career.
My six year old loved it.
He takes real pride in his food and his business.
These innovators of french indian fusion do a great job of making dishes as interesting as possible while still being accessible.
The food was just OK, I would never go back.
Recommended.
This place has the best Indian food in New York, hands down.
A weakness is the chicken in the salads.
The buffet had a nice selection.
Highly recommended.
Whenever you need a Sushi fix, Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service.
First the wrong bread came out with the appetizer, then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course...
We actually left hungry and went across the street to Wo Hop at 15 Mott street for some good chinese food.
Prices even outside of restaurant week were great.
From the moment you walk in, you feel like you're in the perfect place.
But for the Shabu Shabu, you won't find much better in NY.
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian.
What's the difference between the two?
The entrees were served with miso soup and rice.
The food and staff always surprise me with the new heights they are taken to.
To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora.
The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes.
I will recommend Scopa to all of my friends for a place to go for wonderful Italian food.
But who says Murray's is anything about service.
I recommend their Pad See Ew, Pork Chops or Tofu plates.
It's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street.
I don't live in NY but my best friend does.
Best restaurant in Brooklyn
At night the atmoshere changes turning into this hidden jewel that is waiting to be discovered.
Don't waste your time or your money.
I have known about this secret for the last 13 years, Emilio(the Godfather) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices.
The food is good, the teriyaki I recommend.
Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth.
We asked for beverages and never received them.
My girlfriend convinced me to go in the other night for a quick bite.
The waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order. 
I had the cod with paella (spicy and very filling, I'm a big eater and could only eat half) while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips (again, a big serving - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries).
And evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful.
Unfortunately, unless you live in the neighborhood, it's not in a convenient location but is more like a hidden treasure.
However, the food and service and dramatically lacking.
For starters they delivered us someone else's order.
Where Gabriela personaly greets you and recommends you what to eat.
The best pad thai i've ever had.
I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere that whisks you away to the left bank of the river Seine.
The dim sum is ok but doesn't taste that fresh, and the little dishes don't look steamy hot as they should (also note lack of Chinese here).
Look elsewhere.
The place is beautiful!
Dessert is a joke...dont bother
The price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate.
At first we were a little taken aback, as this seemed to present a problem, although the restaurant looked fairly empty, but they hastily put the table together for us.
Disappointingly, their wonderful Saketini has been taken off the bar menu.
The service was superb, they treat you like family.
Growing up in NY, I have eaten my share of bagels.
The mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert...definitely going to be back very soon.
excellent tapas at great prices, romantic, small but not overly crowed, excellent
When he's not making authentic Neapolitan pizza in the open brick oven or lightly frying zucchini blossoms, he's visiting the regulars (a growing legion) and checking on newcomers.
If you want Americanized Chinese food with your usual watery, generic white sauce, this is your place.
This restaurant is such a great place.
Service was also very good.
If you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo.
Service was among the best I have ever had in NYC.
I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.
I've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious.
Amazing!
The only thing that strikes you is the decor?(not very pleasant).
Like I said, Nick and Joe's may not be everyone's favorite, but it's mine.
The food was well prepared and the service impecable.
The staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York.
Her review is above.
Even if the food wasn't this good, the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax.
The combination of fresh tomato sauce, fresh mozz cheese, basil and the dough they make with imported flour, makes this is one of the better pizza's in NY.
My mouth starts to water merely thinking about the delight that is this restaurant.
The best burger I have had in the Village.
We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday, and I was thoroughly impressed with the food.
They were dry, stale and pretty flavorless.
I wasn't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes, but I guess that's the price you pay for a popular place.
The food was very expensive (we spent $160 for lunch for two) but extremely tasty.
Definite go if you're used to good Indian restaurant food from abroad.
It's cuz it's so good you need to taste it!!! 
Having discovered Ping's on the internet, we entered with qualms but were instantly put to ease by the fish tanks that greet you as u walk in.
The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty.
Best Pastrami I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous.
Had dinner here on a Friday and the food was great.
The atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking, which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors.
Entrees include classics like lasagna, fettuccine Alfredo and chicken parmigiana.
The Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience.
brick oven gallery is My pick for best pizza restaurant anywhere.
It was raining, and we figured why not?
It is so easy to get a reservation at a top place in NYC with a week's notice.
The prices are wonderfully low.
The chocolate raspberry cake is heavenly- not too sweet, but full of flavor.
A friend from Seattle and I went on a Thursday night around 8:30.
Never have I had such dramatic delivery guys (a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c I live in a walkup) who always seem disappointed with their tips.
Most importantly, it is reasonably priced.
We were very disappointed.
The setting is casual and romantic.
Which lets face it....at times it's a good thing.
No plans to return anytime soon.
the food - not worth the price.
The menu looked great, and the waiter was very nice, but when the food came, it was average.
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice.
Nevertheless the food itself is pretty good.
The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless, so was the seafood tagliatelle.
We weren't!
I'll being with a couple of positives: cool decor, good pita and hummus, and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty.
Good food.
Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem!
If you are someone who appreciates the same things but hope to have food to spare or share, Kai may not be the best option.
Over price, and small portions .
Would NEVER go back
My vegetable risotto was burnt, and infused totally in a burnt flavor.
they were dry and disgusting, i didn't even finish my first piece.
A beef Consomme.
I cannot imagine you not rushing out to eat there.
Having hunted around for a quiet, romantic, yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot.
My boyfriend and I have been to The Minnow four times now and we have consistently been impressed.
I come here enjoy very much with husband.
Service was very prompt but slightly rushed.
I'm in love with the lobster ravioli!
several times and put up with the waiters' bad manners, knowing that their job isn't easy.
The wine list is also really nice.
Monday nights are a bargain at the $28 prix fix - this includes a three course meal plus *three* glasses of wine paired with each course.
Pizza and garlic knots are great as well, I order from them quite often and the delivery is always super quick!
The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.
The decoration was feeling like we was on the Cairo, actually the street is part of that adventure.
The food was very good and I was pleasantly surprised to see so many vegan options.
I will NEVER return.
THE MOST FUN RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TOO!
Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them.
My first experience at Siam Square was very pleasant.
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category.
I loved it.
We had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar food was just what we were looking for.
The Yellowtail was particularly good as well.
The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion (maybe 3 of each). 
He offers subpar service and has no personality.
THe perfect spot.
I was pleasantly suprised.
I go twice a month!
Indo Chinese food, pretty good...
Always a nice crowd, but never loud.
Great staff.
Overall, not worth the money.
Great bar, most gorgeous bartenders you've ever seen (specifically the blond lady).
We parked on the block of Nina's the place looked nice, with people obviously enjoying their pizzas.
The worst though was the taste.
The food was not fresh, the sauces were bland and very oily.
First of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review.
Always busy but fast moving.
The farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty.
We always have a delicious meal and always leave feeling satisfied.
SUM IT: don't read the '10's' reviews, try it to judge for yourself so you won't have as hi expectations, then you'll be sure to enjoy it.
Sometimes you pay a lot and don't get much in return - it's manhattan, things are expensive.
I LOOOVE their eggplant pizza, as well as their pastas!
I particularly love their yellowfun tuna and their mussel selection.
The decor is very simple but comfortable.
Dakshin is one of the few affordable and tasty Indian restaurant in the upper east side.
And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic.
Check it out
We visited Orsay during NY Restaurant Week and tried their $35 menu.
My friend had a burger and I had these wonderful blueberry pancakes.
The place was quiet and delightful.
Salads are a delicious way to begin the meal.
Did I mention that the coffee is OUTSTANDING?
Love Al Di La
Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers, no matter what the reviews say.
I think this a a wonderful place.
The Bagels have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture, both chewy yet not gummy.
People are always friendly.
A real dissapointment.
I mentioned the squid dish wasn't very good when the waitress visited.
Favourites include: potato spinach gnocchi and the lamb.
They did not have mayonnaise, forgot our toast, left out ingredients (ie cheese in an omelet), below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it.
Just straight up cheap, good food.
Although the restaurant itself is nice, I prefer not to go for the food.
Food was decent, but not great.
Won't or Can't is not in the service directory.
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place.
Two words: Free wine.
The fish was adequate, but inexpertly sliced.
The pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere.
The food is great and the prices are reasonable.
I've eaten at many different Indian restaurants.
My fav was the sassy lassi...
Great Indian food and the service is incredible.
Good service, great food, good value, and never have to wait in line!
Got club soda, filled with ice, no lime.
during busy hrs, i recommend that you make a reservation.
Save your money and don't waste your calories, go to Margharita's on Washington Street instead, they have amazing food and the BEST service.
But $500 for a dinner for two that didn't include Wine?
The service was excellent - friendly and attentive.
Great food at reasonable prices.
I'm amazed we haven't been kicked out of this place yet.
It's somewhere you can eat and be happy.
Fluke sashimi drizzled with jalapeno-lime olive oil, the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish's sweetness.
So close, but not good enough.
less wait time for me!
The waiters and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but weren't as dismayed or apologetic as I would have expected.
I have eaten at some of the 'best' sushi joints in NYC (Nobu, Bond Street, JewelBako, etc) and Yamato is my favorite.
Two complaints- their appetizer selection stinks, it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu.
My friends and I have been going here regularly for two years.
I've lived in NY for 5 years and this place has it all.
It's really also the service, is good and the waiters are friendly.
The pastas are incredible, the risottos (particularly the sepia) are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing.
Also, the hostess called me today to thank us for coming and mentioned how she hoped that my girlfriend enjoyed her birthday - unexpected, but a truly above and beyond thing to do...
Also, because it is so thin, it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling.
Have a mojito and sit in the back patio.
How do you rate home?
The waiters are very friendly and helpful and if you frequent they will remember you.
The one up front will smile and say What can I get for you, brother?
Faan is sooo good.
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us.
Loved it!
We ate out in the back patio, which is worth it as it's cool and the music is hear well there.
They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!
If you go to Roth's try to be served by Mike, he is GREAT!!
I had to wait for my friend at the bar for a few minutes
This is one of our all-time favorite.
Just remember, the later you go, the longer you may have to wait.
Eating in, the atmosphere saves it, but at your desk, it's a very disappointing experience.
I do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy.
Raymond the bartender rocks!
The portions of the food that came out were mediocre.
Tables are close, so you better be comfortable bumping elbows with other patrons.
I discovered Applebees when I went away to college in VA.
Speedy delivers, great food, decent prices, and friendly service combine to ensure an enjoyable repast.
This restaurant is a wonderful place to go many times and it is reasonably priced.
Seriously, this is the best all you can eat in town- As everyone says, the Spicy Tuna hand rolls are the best- have 4 of these, and you've broken even.
Volare virgins or weekly regulars, everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly.
The ingredients taste fresher, the crust is thinner and crispier, the slice is less oily, and it's never burnt like it occasionally is at Joe's.
We will go back every time we are in the City.
The food was pretty good, but a little flavorless and the portions very small, including dessert.
Have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience.
The service was great as well.
The dim sum however was very good.
Service is fast and friendly.
Had a late night dinner on a Saturday night.
hmmm.
Taking Hot Dogs to the next level
They have very quick service which is great when you don't have much time.
Great survice
The first time the sushi was outstanding, the second time it was a little bland.
I found the variety of the sashimi plate to be satisfying - fresh and yummy.
Bagels are ok, but be sure not to make any special requests!
Personally I like the margherita pizza better, but they are all good.
I love Ess-a-bagel, but I live on the west side, so I often go to Murray's for convenience.
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, two types of sake, and the banana tempura.
Some of the finest latin women you'll see in your life hang out at Jimmy's.
The service does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but I have never been treated rudely.
I was in love with Pongsri on 48th, but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced.
We've lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had dinner there.
Skip this location and go to the one in Soho.
Great bagels, spreads and a good place to hang out in.
I had the mango chicken and i can't go on to tell you how delicious that was and the presentation was beatiful.
and you can't beat the prices.
Overall I would recommend it and go back again.
Service was good and so was the atmosphere.
You won't find that anywhere in Manhattan.
Very affordable and excellent ambient!
And they have these home made potato chips at the bar that are the most delicious things in the world!
Only suggestion is that you skip the dessert, it was overpriced and fell short on taste.
Rosario's is without a doubt one of the greatest pizzerias in existence.
Right off the major deegan you get ladies from all over the city.
Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that.
We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town.
I noted it was crossed off on the bill.
I went to Del Frisco's Friday night with my boyfriend for an 8:00 reservation.
Will prob. not return but it is a great dinning experience to try atleast once.
Dessert: pure disaster.
Innovations are just as assured, from the simple Carinthia cheese ravioli with wild mushrooms to the caviar-topped sturgeon, beautifully matched with a bright green spinach-vodka sauce.
Now we moved out of the state and every visit to NYC includes a stop here.
There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table.
Yeah, it's that good.
We didn't know if we should order a drink or leave?
We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai.
This tiny Williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising.
I visit New Green Bo when I have money or when I am broke.
Service was slow, but the people were friendly.
No thanks!!!
Our friends have not arrived yet.
Have frequented 'ino for several years and the food remains excellent.
It was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York, and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to New York.
I was one of the people that went for this horrible experience.
Not only was the waiter efficient and courteous, but also extremely helpful. 
And that's no mean feat...
Gross food – Wow-
Overall, decent food at a good price, with friendly people.
I heartily recommend.
All of my co-workers stated that the food was amazing and wondered why they hadn't heard about this place.
Other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced, the atmosphere is filled with energy (and the beautiful people of course) and the food was surprising good!
service is friendly, and never had a problem walking in and getting a table.
My friend's food was also the complete opposite of what it's supposed to taste like (aND look like).
I would highly recommend it.
THE BIG COMPLAINT: NO TOASTING AVAILABLE.
So eat fast and order a lot.
I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date.
We were seated and ignored by waitstaff.
This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie (that don’t serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!
All toppings are so fresh you'd think they had their own vegetable garden and the crust is so perfect, that one actually thinks of how it was made.
I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try.
The service was the only thing good about this restaurant.
Best hot dogs in the tri-state area.
Love YUKA.
So, again, give it a try.
less wait time for me!
delicious bagels, especially when right out of the oven.
Highly impressed from the decor to the food to the hospitality to the great night I had!
The restaraurant is very small so reservations are a must.
I took my boyfriend for a dinner on saturday night.
The hostess was very pleasant.
It's worthwhile to take a cab to Chelsea just for an awesome dinner at My Chelsea.
The Management was less than accomodating.
The view is spectacular, and the food is great.
This quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my Manhattan restaurant list.
Brava La Pizza Fresca!
Food is excellent and they also have empenadas and plaintains which are good for an afternoon snack.
Maybe it has improved since then?
They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends.
We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche.
The food is authentic Italian - delicious!
Food is excellent quality for a good restaurant price.
The service was attentive, yet discreet.
The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out.
This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money.
And the food, well the food will keep you coming back.
We liked it so much, that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York.
it's the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food.
If the weather is nice, try to snag an outside table.
Appetizers are somewhere around $7 each and the main dishes are between $11 and $16.
My entire family was horrified.
My husband and I ate here after reading reviews here as well as hobokeni.com,
I would like to return and try some of the other menu items when I don't have to rush off to a show.
i love the pics of andy warhol when he used to frequent the place (he painted the ballato's sign in the window).
The service was attentive, yet discreet.
Decor is nice and minimalist, food simple yet very well presented and cooked, and the wine list matches the food very well.
Who said go when the place is quiet during the day?
and for this i had to shell out a small fortune?
The Thali was small, thoroughly unremarkable, and $14.95.
This big draw is the all you can sushi here for $19.95!
Yeah Shanghai is also great but not quite as good -- they use the same amount of salt but without sweetness to balance out.
It seems like this is a place the locals like and the people working here liked it too.
It's cute and simple and I loved it.
SO SO SO SO SO good!
Beautiful experience.
If you go, try the marinara/arrabiatta sauce, the mozzarella en Carozza is mmmmmmmm..... everything is just delicious.
Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months.
THIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED.
Been going here since it opened have seen the quality value decrease considerably.
I recently visited over this past summer after being away for a year.
After really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner.
My husband and I have been sold on this from the first visit.
I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna.
One of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood.
Skip this restaurant, it's a big disappointment.
We all agreed that mare is one of the best seafood restaurants in New York.
It's one of our favorite places to eat in NY.
For $760 for 2 people, it's a once in a lifetime experience.
The takeout menu says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more italian dishes, I can't wait!
Sushi so fresh that it crunches in your mouth.
I'm from England, and Haru's was the best I had in NYC.
$160 for 2 filets, 2 sides, an appetizer and drinks.
I really loved the different and inovated touch that's the cheff gives to the food.
Will never be back.
I have been to Casimir over 5 times and I have always had a great time there.
in an effort to increase turnover, the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary espresso cup filled with chocolate mousse.
The ambience is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt service.
Over 100 different choices to create your own.
the bestt!
The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service.
They kindly brought us more to see if it was better, but it was not!
Granted the space is smaller than most, it is the best service you will find in even the largest of restaurants.
I stumbled upon this great pizzeria as I explored my new neighborhood.
We'll definitly be back again!
Although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great.
The staff has always been attentive and kind, and I've always been amazed at how they've handled all the various different group sizes that come in.
The wine list is extensive and impressive.
Amma has the worst value for money I have experienced in NYC over the past 2 years.
If this restaurant was in Manhattan, I would definitely go more often.
If you'd like to have a nice light meal with an asian accent, Long Tan is a good place on the slope.
I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine!
It's always quiet because it's awful.
You must try the shrimp appetizers.
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, two types of sake, and the banana tempura.
Be sure to accompany your food with one of their fresh juice concoctions.
The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.
Will never be back.
I heard the lobster roll was excellent. 
With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering, the food here was decent, not great.
My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge!
On a monthly basis my friends and I get together and have a girls night out.
The staff offers impeccable service.
Can’t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients.
They are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine, so if you want to make a reservation you are limited.
The service is fantastic.
It's very spicy but not offensive.
I think the stuff was better than Disney.
I had been searching really hard for a restaurant in New York where I could really feel unwanted and ignored and I finally found it!
I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends, and spent three enjoyable hours there.
Thank you everyone at Water's Edge.
The all you can eat deal is truly amazing here.
The only weird thing was if we got a bottle, the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price X4, which makes no sense whatsoever.
He can't help, they're bought up so fast.
expectations were real hi reading the '10's'.
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently.
The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard.
I have to agree with the previous reviewer.
The only concern i have is with the slighly all-business waitstaff who order and throw the food down, rushing you out.
It's constantly open, catering to the Pakistani cabbies lined up on Crosby St., so there's more turnover with the food than you'd expect (i.e., surprisingly fresh).
The food is average: breakfast food, soups, salads, sandwiches, etc.
Even after a few bad evenings at Bardolino, I keep coming back.
While it was large and a bit noisy, the drinks were fantastic, and the food was superb.
We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.
I can say that the wraps, burgers and salads were all fresh, tasty and the mango margareta at $9 was WELL WORTH the money.
the restaurant was completely empty, but she gave me a dirty look and asked, no reservations?
I recommend this place to everyone who asks me where to go for a good meal.
believe us, we've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs.
Didn't seem like any effort was made to the display and quality of the food.
the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded:):):)
The food is all shared so we get to order together and eat together.
We always enjoy the pizza.
They need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the place is consistent.
I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently.
Siam Square is fairly new to the neighborhood and I think in time will gain the recognition it deserves.
Cantinetta is a real treasure in a see of mediocre Italian restaurants.
Meat-phobes are in luck with the extraordinary veggie burger, made from a distinctive blend of chickpeas, carrots and other vegetables and spices.
For all you lazy folks that don't want to come to Alphabet City, I say, good - stay out.
The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach.
Also, the staff is very attentive and really personable.
This food is asian-air fusion.
One caveat: Some of the curried casseroles can be a trifle harsh.
The food was good.
Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went.
I take all my NYC guests to VT's.
We went to Ino for Valentines.
The frizzy retro girl (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink. 
While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.
The only thing I could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my table.
We had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses!
Straight-forward, no surprises, very decent Japanese food.
While the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made Tiffin so attractive, the menu has been overhauled.
Everyone was smiling so that made me feel welcome.
This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time.
Everything was wonderful; food, drinks, staff, mileau.
Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you.
Wretched and retching
Overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites, but everything was delicious.
For Park avenue I expected so much more.
For the quality of food, a little too expensive.
Try it side by side and there's no comparison.
We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods.
No gimmicks here -- the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation.
$170 down the toilet...
Everyone raved about the atmosphere (elegant rooms and absolutely incomparable views) and the fabulous food!
The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).
It is nearly impossible to get a table, so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner, DO NOT pass it up.
My friend is 100% right in the experience we had.
I had a great experience.
Yes, I ate the food, but I certainly would not have if I had seen the maggot before eating, and I was at this point fairly sick to my stomach.
The food was definitely good, but when all was said and done, I just couldn't justify it for the price (including 2 drinks, $100/person)...
We could not catch our waiter's eye, and he ignored us.
We've found it to be better and fresher than Kiku which is comparable in price.
We always go there on the weekends and leave extremely full and satisfied.
People dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans.
The fried dumplings are GREAT!
The place is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere.
Better than the bagel shop on the corner, but not worth going out of your way for, in my opinion.
If you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde.
I would definitely recommend Mary's and am making it one of my regular neighborhood haunts.
the food is decent.
Terrible would be a compliment!
Anyway, this is the last time I cross the williamsburg.
My wife and I always enjoy the young, not always well trained but nevertheless friendly, staff, all of whom have a story.
Why do people rave about the ambience.
First went here to enjoy their garden terrace.
Went to Village last night for my birthday.
Excellent spot for holiday get togethers with co-workers or friends that you haven't seen in a while.
I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee (rice porridge).
There's nice and quiet, small but enough for 6 (or more).
A touch more jalapeno heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed.
The service was dreadfully slow (the place was only half full) and a smile would have been nice...
The side dishes were passable, and I did get a refill upon request.
Amazing!
The exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations.
Decor is minimalist and clean - nothing to distract or commend.
Our waiter was horrible; so rude and disinterested.
It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant, with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender, but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere.
Rather than eating the meat entree being offered, I requested a vegetarian dish.
They bring a sauce cart up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your steak (I tried them ALL).
Make sure you try this place as often as you can.
They're rude at times, and not very friendly.
I never write on these sites but this restaurant is def worth commending!
The owner truly caters to all your needs.
And the food was fantastic.
They forgot a sandwich, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter.
The blond wood decor is very soothing, the premium sake is excellent and the service is great.
The food and service were fine, however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant.
Prices are higher to dine in and their chicken tikka marsala is quite good.
I'm no food critic, but I'd like to think I have a tiny bit of experience under my belt having lived in NY for the last 11 years.
good music, great food, speedy service affordable prices.
The wine list was extensive - though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings.
Go hungry and enjoy.
If your favorite Chinese food is General Tao chicken, then this is NOT your place.
That is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish, and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste.
But, they were too big for the bun.
Plenty of choices to make your own creation.
It is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no traffic noise.
Service ok but unfriendly,filthy bathroom.
I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
Wonderful!
Ess-A-Bagel (either by Sty-town or midtown) is by far the best bagel in NY.
But they do.
The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned.
Maybe it was just an unintentional mistake but I've experienced the same with other restaurants so I don't appreciate such practice.
Very good value
Great place to relax and enjoy your dinner
My friend from Milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian.
I haven't been to the other locations.
Each bite of food at Kai was indeed delicious, fresh, and elegant.
You will be satisfied.
We were in search of food and stumbled on this block of Indian restaurants on East Sixth Street.
The service is awful--the last time I was there (and I do mean the last time) we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave.
Went there for an office lunch.
Be careful, when they say spicy, they mean it!
Not a great place for family or general dining.
Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu, though- too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick.
Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at ALL COST!
We only ordered desserts and drinks, but no refills were offered.
The food is so cheap and the waiters are nice.
My husband and I had a blast.
Even though it is a little loud, you don't have to yell at each other to talk.
Single Worst Restaurant in Manhattan
By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers!
not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly.
Consequently, their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them.
I ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor.
You get the sense that the people there care about their restaurant and about your experience and that is very nice.
The chicken pot pie is excpetiona, the cheeseburger huge and delictable, and the service professional wan warm.
I found this restaurant to be one that truly values its patrons.
Priced at upper intermediate range.
Two wasted steaks -- what a crime!
But I'd go back
The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I've had at this price range.
He not only makes his own homemade mozzarella, but every pie is ultra fresh.
Something about them being busy with holiday party's.
As for the bar, this is another bad idea.
The man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7, then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving (mean while there were boths open all around).
Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that.
I have been in NYC for over 10 years and could not find this delicacy east of the Hudson .
The food is good, especially their more basic dishes, and the drinks are delicious.
But the coconut rice was good.
Go to son cubano in edgewater nj instead.
Drinks way over priced.
I just don't understand all the hype...
The service, however, is a peg or two below the quality of food (horrible bartenders), and the clientele, for the most part, are rowdy, loud-mouthed commuters (this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff) getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game.
Drawbacks: service is slow and they don't toast!
Its a nice quiet location to go eat a good meal, relax, be able to talk and have a very good time.
It's traditional, simple italian food.
You can get a table without a reservation if you get there early I they don't make you by bottles.
Tuk Tuk is my second favorite neighborhood Thai place (the first being Joya).
In the end you end up with a fair tab and NOTHING BUT A GREAT TIME!!!
The boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they're perfect for 2 people.
I've been to several places for Dim Sum and this has got to be the WORST.
The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals.
The music does get a little loud at times, but it just made me want to lean closer to my beautiful wife, and as I did, I got a whiff of corriander.
I have been here a few times for dinner, once for brunch and twice for lunch.
stick with the chicken, beef, and lamb dishes.
I had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz. of Maine Lobster in it.
Frites were delicious if a bit on the thick side.
The pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap, frozen, shredded cheese common to most pizzaria's.
it's delicious!
Salads were fantastic.
Based on a visit a month ago, I returned the week before Christmas and was hugely disappointed.
Went for a late weekday lunch.
I had a grat time at Jekyll and Hyde!
Came looking for this place because I heard good things.
The portion sizes here are huge, and the sushi is good.
If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible!
Again, the waitress was awesome.
I used to be a regular costumer at pongal until dosa hut opened right next door to it.
Highly recommended to all!
Coming from Boston this place is like Emma's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge (although they have more funky toppings!)
The food there are sastifying.
(The sashimi is cut a little thinly.
Secondly, on this night the place was overwhelmed by upper east side ladies perfume.
