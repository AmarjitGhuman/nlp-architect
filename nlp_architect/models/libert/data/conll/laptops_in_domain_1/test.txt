It	O

more	O

This	O

Now	O
the	O

they	O
only	O

now	O
I	O

***	O
The	O
review	O
below	O
is	O
no	O
longer	O
relevant	O
,	O
Apple	O
has	O
fixed	O
the	O
issue	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
three	O
words	O
:	O
Piece	O
of	O
Junk	O
!	O

It	O
is	O
fast	B-OP
and	O
easy	B-OP
to	O
use	B-ASP
.	O

I	O
loaded	O
windows	B-ASP
7	I-ASP
via	O
Bootcamp	B-ASP
and	O
it	O
works	O
flawlessly	B-OP
!	O

but	O
after	O
i	O
got	O
used	O
to	O
it	O
i	O
love	B-OP
it	O
.	O

The	O
price	B-ASP
and	O
features	B-ASP
more	B-OP
than	O
met	O
my	O
needs	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
pretty	O
snappy	B-OP
and	O
starts	B-ASP
up	I-ASP
in	O
about	O
30	O
seconds	O
which	O
is	O
good	B-OP
enough	O
for	O
me	O
.	O

It	O
works	B-ASP
fine	B-OP
with	O
our	O
wireless	O
and	O
they	O
've	O
had	O
not	O
problems	B-OP
.	O

Obviously	O
we	O
both	O
got	O
new	O
Macs	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
much	O
more	O
streamlined	B-OP
system	O
for	O
adding	O
programs	B-ASP
,	O
using	O
the	O
internet	O
,	O
and	O
doing	O
other	O
things	O
everyone	O
does	O
on	O
a	O
computer	O
.	O

So	O
this	O
is	O
very	O
good	B-OP
commputer	O
and	O
i	O
highly	O
suggest	O
it	O
.	O

It	O
may	O
take	O
a	O
little	O
getting	O
used	O
to	O
but	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O

worry	O

although	O
some	O
people	O
might	O
complain	O
about	O
low	O

which	O
I	O
think	O
is	O
ridiculous	O
.	O

The	O
only	O
bad	B-OP
thing	O
about	O
it	O
is	O
they	O
give	O
you	O
the	O
worst	B-OP

Built-in	B-ASP

are	O

It	O

I	O
love	B-OP
it	O

They	O
are	O
simpler	B-OP
to	O
use	B-ASP

I	O
also	O
like	B-OP
the	O

these	O
were	O

only	O
two	O
things	O
I	O
liked	B-OP
about	O
this	O

i	O
dont	O
understand	O
why	O
i	O
spent	O
twice	O
as	O
much	O
to	O
get	O
a	O

rather	O
than	O
a	O
desktop	O
when	O
my	O

is	O
completely	O
immoble	O

At	O
first	O

the	O

seemed	O
a	O
great	B-OP

seemingly	O
high-end	B-OP

for	O
a	O
low	B-OP

it	O

the	O
