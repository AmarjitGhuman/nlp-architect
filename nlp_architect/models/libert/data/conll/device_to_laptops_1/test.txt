This	O

0	O

I	O
had	O
to	O
choose	O
at	O

one	O
,	O

IMO	O
NO	O
STARS	O

After	O
looking	O
at	O
all	O
the	O
pros	O
and	O
cons	O
,	O
I	O
decided	O
on	O
the	O
Macbook	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
even	O
put	O
my	O
entire	O

The	O

If	O

you	O
dont	O

Anyways	O
I	O
bought	O
this	O
two	O
months	O

when	O
I	O
first	O
brought	O
it	O
home	O
it	O
kept	O
giving	O
me	O
a	O

Long	O

after	O
many	O

I	O
was	O

I	O
had	O

I	O
have	O
a	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
first	O

that	O
I	O
tried	O

owning	O
a	O
netbook	O
although	O
I	O
have	O
used	O
3	O
different	O
laptops	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
10	O
years	O
,	O
I	O
find	O
not	O

except	O
of	O

for	O
the	O

I	O
have	O
n't	O
used	O
it	O
for	O
anything	O
high	O

yet	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
love	B-OP
it	O
already	O
.	O

I	O
constantly	O
had	O
to	O
send	O
my	O
laptop	O
in	O
for	O
services	B-ASP
every	O
3	O
months	O
and	O
it	O
always	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
same	O
problem	B-OP
that	O
they	O
said	O
they	O
had	O
already	O
fixed	O

Finally	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
reach	O
a	O
young	O
lady	O
in	O
California	O
and	O
ordered	O
the	O
machine	O
and	O
was	O
subsequently	O
given	O
a	O
delivery	O
date	O

I	O
've	O
already	O
recommended	B-OP
this	O
laptop	O
to	O
a	O
friend	O
who	O
eye	O
'd	O
the	O
computer	O
when	O
I	O
took	O
it	O
out	O

my	O

More	O
times	O
that	O
not	O
the	O

I	O
have	O
a	O
bad	B-OP
internet	B-ASP
connection	I-ASP

or	O
the	O
page	O
ca	O
n't	O

I	O
just	O
fell	B-OP
in	I-OP
love	I-OP
with	O
this	O
thing	O

the	O
key	B-ASP
bindings	I-ASP
take	O
a	O
little	O
getting	O
used	O
to	O
,	O
but	O
have	O
loved	B-OP
the	O
Macbook	O
Pro	O
.	O

The	O
only	O
solution	O
is	O
to	O
turn	O
the	O
brightness	B-ASP
down	O
,	O
etc	O
.	O

It	O
has	O
been	O
to	O
early	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
this	O
actually	O
fixes	O
the	O
problem	O
or	O
not	O
though	O
.	O

The	O
speed	B-ASP
is	O
incredible	B-OP
and	O
I	O
am	O
more	O
than	O
satisfied	B-OP
.	O

I	O
bought	O
the	O
netbook	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
smaller	B-OP
and	O
lighter	B-OP
for	O
me	O
to	O
carry	O
around	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
to	O
return	O
it	O
because	O
it	O
would	O
n't	O
even	O
start	O
.	O

Somehow	O
the	O
system	B-ASP
clock	I-ASP
got	O
messed	B-OP
up	I-OP
after	O
reboot	O
.	O

The	O
speakers	B-ASP
are	O
terrible	B-OP
and	O
are	O
probably	O
the	O
cheapest	B-OP
ones	O
I	O
have	O
ever	O
seen	O
in	O
a	O
laptop	O
so	O
if	O
your	O
planning	O
to	O
listen	O
to	O
music	O
I	O
suggest	O
you	O
get	O
something	O
better	O
.	O

I	O
first	O
purchased	O
this	O
Dell	O

"	O
1764	O

on	O
April	O

I	O
bought	O
this	O

on	O
Saturday	O
and	O
am	O
completely	O
in	O
love	B-OP
with	O
it	O

I	O
chose	O
the	O
iBookG4	O
,	O
a	O

that	O
is	O
an	O
attractive	B-OP
computer	O
with	O
a	O
large	B-OP

big	B-OP
enough	O
to	O
please	O
anyone	O

When	O
I	O
called	O
Sony	O
the	O
Customer	B-ASP

was	O
Great	B-OP

They	O
say	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
the	O
motherboard	B-ASP
again	O
,	O
but	O
Dell	O

I	O
love	B-OP
everything	O
about	O
this	O

Was	O
n't	O
sure	O
if	O
I	O
was	O
going	O

less	O
love	O
it	O
so	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
a	O
local	O
best	O
buy	O
and	O
played	O
around	O
with	O
the	O
IOS	B-ASP
system	I-ASP
on	O
a	O
Mac	O
Pro	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
totally	O
unique	B-OP
and	O
different	B-OP
.	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
anyone	O
looking	O
for	O
a	O
good	B-OP
durrable	B-OP
laptop	O
then	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
way	O

Im	O
very	O
happy	B-OP
with	O
this	O

I	O
left	O
the	O

This	O
is	O
still	O
a	O
fairly	O
good	B-OP
upgrade	O
to	O
a	O
laptop	O
that	O
was	O
about	O
4	O
years	O

This	O
was	O
around	O
three	O
years	O

maybe	O
four	O

but	O
it	O
has	O
a	O
major	O
design	B-ASP
flaw	B-OP

Also	O
the	O
speakers	B-ASP
are	O
not	O
very	O
loud	B-OP

But	O
it	O
is	O

I	O
had	O
the	O

for	O
a	O

it	O
was	O
a	O
new	O
computer	O

Finally	O
after	O
months	O
of	O
research	O
the	O
discovered	O
that	O
they	O
mailed	O
it	O
to	O
a	O
Walmart	O

there	O
probably	O
would	O
be	O
no	O

Never	O
been	O

I	O
finally	O

my	O

out	O

My	O
battery	B-ASP
went	O
bad	B-OP

a	O

it	O
and	O
it	O
cost	O
around	O
eighty	O

a	O

I	O
like	B-OP
the	O
design	B-ASP
and	O
its	O

but	O
there	O
are	O
somethings	O
I	O
think	O
needs	O
to	O
be	O
improved	O

It	O
's	O
priced	B-ASP
very	O
reasonable	B-OP

works	B-ASP
very	O
well	B-OP
right	O
out	O

the	O

I	O
only	O
used	O
it	O

and	O
I	O
dont	O
know	O
how	O
many	O

it	O

will	O
never	O
