they	O

I	O
was	O
tired	O
of	O
going	O
without	O
my	O

every	O
few	O

The	O
ATI	B-ASP
graphics	I-ASP
card	I-ASP
is	O
a	O
huge	B-OP
plus	I-OP
,	O
definitely	O
a	O
good	B-OP
value	O
if	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
run	O
some	O
slightly	O
older	O
games	O
that	O
a	O
Intel	B-ASP
built-in	I-ASP
card	I-ASP
would	O
have	O
trouble	O
with	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
Half-Life	O
2	O
or	O
even	O
World	O

I	O
bought	O
this	O
last	O
week	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
very	O
next	O
day	O
had	O
to	O
return	O
it	O
because	O
it	O
over	O
heated	O
and	O
the	O
touch-mouse	B-ASP
stopped	B-OP
responding	O
.	O

Only	O
problem	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
was	O
that	O
the	O
track	B-ASP
pad	I-ASP
was	O
not	O
very	O
good	B-OP
for	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
only	O
had	O
a	O
problem	O
once	O
or	O
twice	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
But	O
probably	O
my	O
computer	O
was	O
a	O
bit	O
defective	B-OP
.	O

I	O
absolutely	O
love	B-OP
my	O
mac	O
!	O

I	O
had	O
my	O
computer	O
custom	O
built	O
from	O
Sonystyle.com	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
stamped	O
and	O
not	O
in	O
pieces	O
therefore	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
stronger	B-OP
more	O
resilient	O
frame	B-ASP
.	O

He	O
gave	O
me	O
this	O
PC	O
about	O
3	O
years	O
ago	O
and	O
up	O
to	O
this	O
point	O
im	O
still	O
sitting	O
here	O
using	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
so	O
excited	O
to	O
get	O
this	O
in	O
the	O
mail	O
i	O
nearly	O
gave	O
myself	O
a	O
heart	O
attack	O
.	O

i	O
had	O
to	O
return	O
it	O
for	O
a	O
replacement	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
another	O
reason	O
to	O
like	B-OP
the	O
Mac	O

Easy	B-OP
to	O
carry	B-ASP

can	O
be	O
hooked	O
up	O

I	O
especially	O
like	B-OP

Great	B-OP

an	O

recommended	B-OP
this	O

everyone	O
I	O

Finally	O

THAT	O
THIS	O

WAS	O
A	O

At	O
first	O
,	O
the	O

seemed	O
a	O

seemingly	O
high-end	B-OP
specs	B-ASP
for	O
a	O
low	B-OP
,	O
low	B-OP
price	B-ASP

The	O
internet	B-ASP

are	O
also	O
very	O
strong	B-OP
and	O
picks	O
up	O

very	O

Purchased	O

worked	O
good	B-OP
until	O
just	O
after	O
the	O

I	O
love	B-OP
this	O

use	O
it	O
everyday	O

Sure	O
it	O
has	O
the	O

Sure	O
,	O
the	O
initial	O
out	O
of	O

expense	B-ASP
is	O
greater	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
should	O
not	O
dissuade	O
anyone	O
from	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
these	O
machines	O
run	B-ASP
like	O
none	O

but	O
keep	O
in	O

that	O
Apple	O
started	O

I	O
had	O
in	O

Finally	O

the	O

been	O
tech	B-ASP
support	I-ASP

It	O
is	O
so	O
much	O
easier	B-OP
to	O
use	B-ASP

So	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
years	O
later	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
dumb	O
college	O
girl	O
and	O
had	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
wireless	O
internet	O
.	O

Was	O
skeptical	O
about	O
buying	O
an	O
electronic	O
item	O
online	O
but	O
it	O
turned	O
out	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
positive	O
experience	O
.	O

After	O
having	O
two	O
PC	O
laptops	O
die	O
with	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
3	O
years	O
,	O
I	O

to	O
the	O

Best	O
Buy	O
by	O
the	O
sleek	B-OP

less	B-OP

issues	I-ASP

All	O
in	O
all	O
,	O
I	O
'm	O
incredibly	O
dissatisfied	B-OP
with	O
this	O
laptop	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
HP	O
as	O
a	O
whole	O
.	O

Then	O
it	O
ceased	B-OP
charging	B-ASP
at	O
all	O

Does	O
everything	O
I	O
wanted	O
this	O

After	O
numerous	O
calls	O
to	O
Applecare	B-ASP

,	O
I	O
was	O
directed	O
to	O
send	O

my	O

Biggest	O
complaint	B-OP
is	O
Windows	B-ASP
8	I-ASP
.	O

It	O
doesnt	O
overheat	O
or	O
make	O
any	O
loud	B-OP
noises	O
.	O

I	O
just	O
got	O
this	O
laptop	O
for	O
college	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
far	O
I	O
am	O
very	O
happy	B-OP
with	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
speakers	B-ASP
on	O
it	O
are	O
useless	B-OP
too	O
.	O

I	O
like	O
the	O
Mini	O
Mac	O
it	O
was	O
easy	B-OP
to	O
setup	B-ASP
and	O
install	B-ASP
,	O
but	O
I	O
am	O
learning	O
as	O
I	O
go	O
and	O
could	O
use	O
a	O
tutorial	B-ASP
to	O
learn	O
how	O
to	O
use	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
features	B-ASP
I	O
was	O
use	O
to	O
on	O
the	O
PC	O
especially	O
the	O
right	B-ASP
mouse	I-ASP
click	I-ASP

I	O
love	B-OP
the	O
15	O
"	O
MacBook	O

I	O
am	O
still	O
in	O
the	O
process	O
of	O
learning	O
about	O
its	O
features	B-ASP
.	O

They	O
would	O
repair	O
one	O
thing	O
,	O
send	O
it	O
back	O
and	O
it	O
would	O
still	O
have	O
the	O
same	O
problem	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
never	O
had	O
any	O
issues	O
or	O
problems	O
with	O
my	O
MacBook	O

so	O
far	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
still	O
as	O
fast	B-OP
as	O
it	O
was	O
when	O
I	O
first	O
bought	O
it	O

That	O
includes	O
transferring	O
my	O

And	O
now	O
I	O

I	O

currently	O
out	O

about	O

I	O
know	O
Apples	O
are	O
more	O
expensive	B-OP
than	O
PCs	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
thinks	O
it	O
is	O
worth	B-OP
every	O

it	O
is	O
hard	B-OP
to	O
fix	O
and	O
makes	O
it	O
a	O
hassle	B-OP

own	O
one	O

I	O
got	O
the	O
black	O
MacBook	O
two	O
years	O

and	O
have	O
never	O
regretted	O
it	O

So	O
much	O
faster	B-OP

sleeker	B-OP
looking	B-ASP

I	O
am	O
an	O
Info	O
Sys	O
major	O
in	O

,	O
so	O
I	O
started	O
researching	O
this	O

I	O
upgraded	O
from	O
a	O
5	O

and	O
was	O
amazed	B-OP
to	O
find	O
out	O
that	O
this	O

is	O
much	O
slower	B-OP
then	O
my	O
old	O

2	O

after	O

the	O

Called	O

,	O
they	O
report	O
that	O
they	O

it	O

Anyway	O
,	O
in	O
early	O
July	O
of	O
this	O

,	O
the	O
DVD	B-ASP

stopped	O
working	O

the	O

stared	O
having	O
issues	B-OP
with	O

I	O
HATE	B-OP
this	O
one	O
.	O

Have	O
returned	O
that	O

unused	O
.	O

The	O
technical	B-ASP
support	I-ASP
was	O
not	O
helpful	B-OP
as	O
well	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
definitely	O
reccomend	B-OP
this	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
in	O
the	O
market	O
for	O
an	O
easy	O
to	O
use	B-ASP
,	O
stylish	B-OP
,	O
fun	B-OP
,	O
awesome	B-OP
computer	O

I	O
think	O
that	O
if	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
motherboard	B-ASP
again	O
so	O
soon	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
replace	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
personally	O
like	B-OP
the	O
gaming	B-ASP
look	I-ASP
but	O
needed	O
a	O
machine	O
that	O
delivered	O
gaming	B-ASP
performance	I-ASP
while	O
still	O
looking	O
professional	B-OP
in	O
front	O

my	O

Do	O
you	O
ever	O
think	O
HP	O
would	O
do	O
that	O
?	O
NEVER	O
!	O

AND	O
the	O
best	B-OP
part	O
is	O
that	O
it	O
even	O
comes	O
with	O
a	O
free	B-OP
printer	B-ASP
(	O
when	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
certain	O
promotion/offer	O
going	O

of	O

)	O
!	O

If	O
anything	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
only	O
suggest	O
using	O
one	O
of	O
these	O

if	O
only	O
you	O
have	O
to	O

still	O
testing	O
the	O

as	O
i	O
thought	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
better	B-OP

but	O
am	O
very	O
happy	B-OP
with	O
the	O
upgrade	O

Other	O
than	O
that	O
its	O
a	O
great	B-OP
performing	B-ASP
machine	O
and	O
well	B-OP
meets	O
all	O
my	O
needs	O
and	O
more	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
a	O
little	O
problem	B-OP
adjusting	O

works	O
fine	O
as	O

If	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
case	O
for	O
you	O

I	O
would	O

a	O
pull-behind	O

The	O

I	O

3	O

Then	O
the	O

many	O
