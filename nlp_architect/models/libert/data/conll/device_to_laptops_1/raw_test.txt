This is the third in a series of MacBooks starting with a Black MacBook.
I bought this laptop and found its TAB is not functioning.
The touch pad is among the best.
the touch pad is fine - again, it's a real touch pad.
Microsoft seems to be unable to keep up with repairs for the multitude of windows problems.
Other Thoughts: Do not purchase this product.
This Macbook Pro is fast, powerful, and runs super quiet and cool.
I tried giving it 0 stars but I had to choose at least one, but IMO NO STARS
After looking at all the pros and cons, I decided on the Macbook Pro.
I could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage.
The laptop is gorgeous.
If you buy, pray you dont have major prolems.
Anyways I bought this two months ago and when I first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone.
All-in-all, I would definitely recommend this product for nearly everyone.
But I wanted the Pro for the CD/DVD player.
Processor - When compared to my 3 week old Early 2011 edition there I barely experience any difference in performance (2.3 GHz v/s 2.4 GHz).
My MacBook is probably the best investment I have ever made.
It fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and I have never had any issues with it freezing.
It was still working, but there was nothing on the screen.
10/10 five stars would recommend.
Size: I know 13 is small (especially for a desktop replacement) but with an external monitor, who cares.
Before i bought my new i5, I did my research for about 2 weeks and determined to move for HP to Apple for reliability, dependable, and long lasting operations.
Info: Windows failed to load because the kernal is missing, or corrupt.
and plenty of storage with 250 gb(though I will upgrade this and the ram..)
Worth the investment and truly a fine piece of equipment.
It does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern.
My HP is very heavy.
  The board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues.
We paid for the three year warranty and the extended warranty after that one ended as well.
Nothing bad to say about it.
They didn't even try to assist me or even offer a replacement.
As it turns out, I just didn't know any better.
The ease of set up was terrific.
As a user of a PC, I will will admit that the macBook Pro has a better running system in which I found myself "Getting the job done quicker.
Those things are very important - vital even!
What's also interesting is this survey changed my ratings the first time I submitted it in case it doesn't keep what I put here are my aratings
Its fast and another thing I like is that it has three USB ports.
It s heavy for Mac book but is good.
little short on RAM but you get what you pay for.
Overall, this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from.
This laptop is a great price and has a sleek look.
Overall : Poor, Features: Average, Performance: Poor, Battery Life: Excellent, Price-Value: Poor
I WANT MY L505-s5988 BACK!
In my line of work, I often have to take work home, and this makes it so easy.
The rep did not even answer my question, I had to ask him, if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he didn't even try to acknowledge my question.
This is my first Dell I heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it!
Waiting for the i7 was well worth it, great value for the price.
I spoke to 4 different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a 5th person!
I would buy this lap top over and over again!
I am not sure if it was the drive itself, however;
Apple no longer includes iDVD with the computer and furthermore, Apple doesn't even offer it anymore!
(but Office can be purchased) IF I ever need a laptop again I am for sure purchasing another Toshiba!!
I wish I would have taken the plunge years ago.
Dell Latitude d620 is not a reliable machine.
I baby my electronics so I know for a fact it was defective and not anything that I did to it.
Once open, the leading edge is razor sharp.
The battery life, before the battery completely died of course, left much to be desired.
Hope this helped!
A great computer for light home use and business use.
So think about factoring those things in when you purchase.
  I am however pleased that it is still hanging in there.
But I was wrong.
Beta had better quality, but VHS became the industry standard.
i can use it for all of my needs.
It has come into good use for my finances, scheduling, my parents business expenses, and it is definitely amazing for gaming.
I just love this lap top, I just wish it were all silver or they had all black.
Now that I have upgraded to Lion I am much happier about MAC OS and have just bought an iMac for office.
It also came with a built it web cam which is great because I can see an communicate with my family members back home.
I've lived with the crashes and slow operation and restarts.
This computer was awful, I would never recomend it to another person.
It is in the best condition and has a really high quality.
-Stay away from MacHouse Amsterdam.
Nice packing.
Apple is aware of this issue and this is either old stock or a defective design involving the intel 4000 graphics chipset.
I fell in love with it.
The i5 blows my desktop out of the water when it comes to rendering videos.
  Long story short, since I experience so many problems with my laptop every since I bought it from day one, I didn't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what I pay for a crapy laptop, but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year, they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services, they finally gave in.
Maybe not the cutting edge (Satellite L455D) but it is a workhorse.
I highly recommend this laptop to anybody that wants great performance from a laptop and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your laptop out the door.
That's quite a bump up from the $599 that this little guy sells for, which leaves me to my next point.
My only disappointment with the 13" model is that they're the only ones in the MacBook Pro line up without an i5 or i7 processor and dual graphics cards, however the trade-off is that you achieve a longer battery life (of about 2 more hours).
Yes, a Mac is much more money than the average laptop out there, but there is no comparison in style, speed and just cool factor.
this one, in my opinion, might be a lemon!
This machine delivers.
I have always wanted a MacBook Pro.....always!
It is meant to be PORTABLE.
I tell everyone I see out looking to get this or another Toshiba.
The flaws are, this computer is not for computer gamers because of the OS X.
I consider myself an average user and this computer serves my need.
I did contact HP and share how unhappy I am.
I wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused, because they knew it was trouble.
I had the same reasons as most PC users: the price, the overbearing restrictions of OSX and lack of support for games.
This computer I used daily nice compact design.
The computer is currently in West Verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by Toshiba.
So far so good with this laptop.
My MacBook is faster than any comparable PC.
It's fast at loading the internet.
Other Thoughts: Received replacement 16 Days later.
The screen is nice, side view angles are pretty good.
Again- windows based machines were not giving me anything to work with!
There are differences that you need to know and take time to learn.
If you find yourself in the market for a new laptop (and have the money) don't exclude looking at the MBPs.
But with A WAY Bigger Screen, and IS able to connect to an HDMI.
So what if the laptops/mobile phones look chic and cool? The after sales support is terrible.
I thought learning the Mac OS would be hard, but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a PC.
I called Toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem.
It is very easy to integrate bluetooth devices, and USB devices are recognized almost instantly.
wow the new macbook pro hanged as i tried to type this review.
The receiver was full of superlatives for the quality and performance.
I purchased this laptop while on a business trip to keep up with my email.
My wireless provider confirmed my home internet is fine, and any connections I turn on should work.
I hate to say this, but if I could take this back to the shop and get my money back, then I would.
We did not even have it a year.
  I continued to take the computer in AGAIN and they replaced the hard drive and mother board yet again.
For the [$] price (special offer) this is a great laptop.
The most amazing part to me as a PC user is the startup and shutdown times - and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing.
I also enjoy the fact that my MacBook Pro laptop allows me to run Windows 7 on it by using the VMWare program.
lightweight, long battery life, excellent transition from PC;
Even out of warranty!
They really do have the worlds very worst repair service.
Oh yea, has no numeric pad on the side.
I looked at the computer and it said updating but the asked for a product key.
I had it four months when my disc drive refused to open.
I know what 7 hrs of battery looks like.
Note, however, that any existing MagSafe accessories you have will not work with the MagSafe 2 connection.
I have a business website and every time I have to change something I have to go to the public library to use a PC.
With a mac you don't have to worry about antivirus software or firewall, it's so wonderful.
*3 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Visited MacHouse Amsterdam.
Even if Apple replaces whatever needs replacing I wonder if, since I seem to be doubling the amount of time I get out of it each time it's "like new," I might have 8 months next time.
I now travel with this laptop and my work PC.
Looked at HP, ASUS, Acer, Sony and a bunch of other ones but could not find I really liked.
The large screen also helps when you are working in design based programs like Adobe Creative Suite.
the mbp i recieved was everything it should have been.
They sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that I return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later.
I thought the white Mac computers looked dirty too quicly where you use the mousepad and where you place your hands when typing.
Without a doubt, the *design* of this laptop is fantastic.
Even doing so, the hinge may just be slightly tightened only.
I couldn't believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge.
I need graphic power to run my Adobe Creative apps efficiently.
Not too expense and has enough storage for most users and many ports.
Then to make matters worst, there is noone that they can transfer you to.
If you're looking for a great laptop, you've found the best here.
When I got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct HP told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem.
It is amazing.
Never had a single problem, and don't have to worry about viruses.
  The company sent me a whole new cord overnight and apologized.
The touchpad is very intuitive, so much so that I never want to use buttons to click again!
i love the size of the computer since i play games on it.
Waited on getting this computer, but it has been a great change.
The worst a Mac ever did to me was freeze up.
All you get is a box and a computer.
I bought for my son in the 2nd grade.
this computer will last you at least 7 years, thats an amazing life spanned an electronic.
Now they are believers in the product.
Also I typed faster then then letters would show and it got to be realy annoying.
By the way teachers, they offer a discount which helps!
Very happy with my 7th Toshiba laptop!
Everything is so easy and intuitive to setup or configure.
The feature are good enough for what I need.
You better believe my next computer will be a MAC!
The feel of this is better than the Toshiba, too.
  I would  rather spend my money on a computer that costs more then a Toshiba that  isn't good at all.
This computer is good for 10 days then it sucks for the rest of your life.
I bought this Macbook Pro from Best Buy under a year ago to replace my old Macbook Air.
You just lose a customer.
I own a Hewlett Packard laptop and I've had man problems with it since I bought in in Feb, 201
The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely.
The performance is awesome.
I had meant to purchase the NB205 and bought this one by accident (long story).
  luckly i had a student task force able to help, or else it would have crashed within the first year.
My favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga port so I can connect it to a bigger screen.
I pondered very long over this decision.
For the same price, you get a lot more in the Asus....1920x1080 res.
You won't be disappointed.
I will never go back to a PC again!
So, if you're thinking of a laptop, I would heartily recommend theApple 13.3 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer (Z0J80001) Notebook for all your needs!
She said its very user friendly.
Learning all of the keyboard shortcuts only took a few minutes to get used to as some of the shortcuts are the same on Windows machines.
The speed difference is next to NOTHING for a mac, and the hard drive can be manually upgraded or you could just buy a $60 500gb external hard drive.
The Apple engineers have not yet discovered the delete key.
I like to use it at the race track to handiecap the horse races.
This Mac Mini makes the Macbook Pro seem slow.
I can't even install one of the 3 printers I have in my house so I am unable to print.
Sony parts reliability and quality of service is recenlty the worst.
The battery life is excellent- 6-7 hours without charging.
Pretty much made sense to get a Mini.
It is not even a year old yet, so I would definitely not recommend it to anyone.
For some odd reasons the computer doesn't reconize the operation system.
I have used both PCs and Macs and I have to say that I really really love my Mac Book Pro.
Asus facial recognition doesn't work and windows logon isn't either.
I wasn't really sure I wanted to spend that kind of money!
The dv4 boasted a faster processor, more memory, and a bigger hard drive than my old computer, plus a better quality web cam, nicer screen, and many other features.
the mouse jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i dont want it too.
Otherwise, all other features are a 1
And that was the fourth time ive sent it to them to get fixed.
I can never go back to a PC now, this machine never freezes or has any problems.
  The screen almost looked like a barcode when it froze.
Heck, if I had enough ' money, I would but it as a gift for someone.
I was loving this Netbook because it had an amazing screen and display and was small and light, but after 1 week it stopped openning web pages for me (even after installing new browsers) then eventually it just started giving me a blue screen and crashing everytime I booted it.
Not super fancy, but not super expensive either.
The other lock-up problems are from a myriad of causes, the most common being a corrupted version of Appleworks which can render the browser useless.
I would recomend this acer to parents and grandparents it can really help them in school.
the laptop was really good and it goes really fast just the way i thought it would of run.
I'm pretty sure when I bought it, my bank account went 'ouch!
Now,,,,,my monitor has been acting up for about 2 months.
  They told me it was my loss even though it was the computer, not  what I've done.
It absolutely is more expensive than most PC laptops, but the ease of use, security, and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag.
apple has a reputation and is well known for its easy usage.
go for it!
The audio volume is quite low and virtually unusable in a room with any background activity.
I was ready to take it back for a refund, but the Geek Squad camed through and pointed me in the right direction to get it fixed.
I feel that it was poorly put together, because once in a while different plastic pieces would come off of it.
I have no idea how this could have even gotten past quality control during production.
The new operating system makes this computer into a super iPad.
  That was a big mistake.
Not to mention sometimes the whole charger unit will decide not to work entirely.
Perfect trifecta!
But guess what?  (you have to buy an external dvd drive it doesn't have a built in type) The notebook can't be used because it doesn't read anything for an external drive.
The OS is also very user friendly, even for those that switch from a PC, with a little practice you can take full advantage of this OS!
I wish it had a webcam though, then it would be perfect!
My first laptop was an Acer that I got for Christmas.
It works great for general internet use, Microsoft Office apps, home bookkeeping, etc.
I sent it back AND THEY LOST IT.
Look up recipes and keep it on the kitchen counter while I cook.
My one complaint with this laptop is that I've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in.
So if anyones looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name TOSHIBA on it...
NOT WITH APPLE.
  I don't like this company nor the toshiba brand, and I'll never  buy another one because I've put more into it then it is worth.
It is easy to find documents, and keep them in one area.
I was so excited when my dad said i could get a new laptop for my birthday.
Love it.
but in resume this computer rocks!
It's face and depanable.
They don t translate from a Mac, even on Word, resulting in a ton of run-on sentences.
The only downfall is a lot of the software I have won't work with Mac and iWork is not worth the price of it.
The only time I have restarted is during system updates.
lots of preloaded software.
when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase.
I had my IWORKS, Itunes, Email, MS Office, network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour.
Again in February my computer completely failed to the point that it could not load Windows so I contacted Acer to get it fixed thru my Warrenty and it took about 3 days fighting on the phone with agents and it seemed as though NONE of them spoke English.
it is the worst computer dell ever made.
2) Blue screen first month
Meets my needs perfectly and is light enough for this senior to carry without affecting my arthritis.
Really like the textured surface which shows no fingerprints.
The only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets, and rather quickly too.
As usual at customer service center, she asked me to hold for a moment while she went to the back-office and compare it with other same model netbooks and discussed it with her colleague (I could see them).
Plus stylish.
For the not so good, I got the stock screen - which is VERY glossy.
So, I paid a visit to LG notebook service center at Alexandra Road, hoping they can make the hinge tighter.
With the needs of a professional photographer I generally need to keep up with the best specs.
People know what they are talking about and they have pride in the product that they are selling.
Overall though, for the money spent it's a great deal.
The Mountain Lion OS is not hard to figure out if you are familiar with Microsoft Windows.
Strengths:Well-shaped Weaknesses:A bad videocard!
The software is amazing.
Dells are ok, HPs aren't that good, but Macs or Fantastic.
  This process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the hard drive replaced 3 times.
  i must keep it plugged in at all times because it will not keep a charge for longer than four minutes.
Peformance is good for the price.
So then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back, but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened, and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the repair (the price of a new one).
(Beware, their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a computer is.
Runs real quick.
The one thing that Apple does right is computers.
If you want more information on macs I suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications.
No installation disk (DVD) is included.
THEN, one month after the warranty expired, the replacement charger went.
Skype is just so dang cool with this machine too.
Do not purchase this laptop.
I have recently converted back to a mac and I couldn't be happier!
The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months, stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes.
$999.00 Tax free.
The price premium is a little much, but when you start looking at the features it is worth the added cash.
I will never complain about the price since I believe you get what you pay for and my MacBook Pro was worth every dollar.
They were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place.
Good keyboard, long battery life, largest hard drive and windows 7.
  They ended up keeping my computer for almost 3 months!
I did a lot of research and ended up thinking this Toshiba was the best one for me.
I was getting extrememly frustrated when I would want to do these simple taks that I would have to wait and wait and wait for things to download or virus that would clog up my PC.
Yes, the computer was light weight, less expensive than the average laptop, and was pretty self explantory in use.
Screen size is perfect for portable use in any environment.
Battery life needs more life.
  The Hewitt Packard Pavillion dv6700 was my first laptop, before this I had a Dell desktop that I loved.
They only stay charged a little over an hour.
From the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer!
It was a huge monstrosity of a Laptop!
The sheer power and flexibility makes the MacBook Pro a must have for any techie!
you will not regret it, promise you!
The cool thing about the Mac Book was that I went on my honeymoon and shot a bunch of pictures and movies with my iPhone, then I came back and put them onto my Macbook and made a pretty good DVD movie with all the pictures and videos from my trip.
The Mac Snow Leopard O/S is extremely easy to use, although very different than Win XP, Visa or Win7.
(The SATA controller is the motherboard chip that lets the CPU talk to the hard drive.)
It's A MAC!!
It just works flawlessly!
LOVE IT I've always been an apple fan boy, but never had the money to buy a mac, only ipads and iphones, and this is my first mac, blew me away completely.
They sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still didn't work.
this is quite smooth as well as heavy and can easily slip through the hands.
Had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in.
I would never tell anyone to buy one either.
Good monitor and performed well.
Trying to balance all of my roles leaves very little time for me to do anything, so I want to manage my time I do have to be the most efficient.
My house is now 100% Macbook.
Everything was so easy.
  Remember to do your research first before consider buying a toshiba product.
My son and his family have a hard time financially because he is self-employed so the family had no computer of any kind, and kyle the oldest child is 12 and really need something to help him in school.
Our Apple 13.3 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer (Z0J80001) Notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking.
I sent it back to Toshiba twice they covered it under the  warranty.
Took several hours with customer support before I could even start the PC out of the box.
falls into the case.
" Then I proceed to tell her that I checked out other retail stores that carry the netbook and it wasn't LIKE THAT.
We researched and found the best price at MacConnection.
I am glad I did my research.
They claim that I should be happy because I am getting a new laptop to replace my two-month old laptop.
Even though it is much more expensive than many PC laptops, it is worth the price.
it might be something deep within Windows, for I was unable to create a disk image on my hard drive.
I just took the broken cords into the Apple store and they gave me new ones.
I like iTunes, the apparent security, the Mini form factor, all the nice graphics stuff.
However, the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary (unless you're gaming).
Sometimes you really have to tap the pad to get it to worki
Once I removed all the software the laptop loads in 15-20 seconds.
The track pad to me is what really stands out though, you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pad, awesome thinking Apple!
Then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running.
  Then I've fixed the DC jack (inside the unit), rewired the DC jack to the OUTside of the laptop, replaced the power brick.
But see the macbook pro is different because it may have a huge price tag but it comes with the full software that you would actually need and most of it has free future updates.
It was about six months later when the overheating problem started again, to the point it felt like fire on the bottom of the machine!
Bottom line, I doubt you'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine.
The track pad is a bit squirrely at times- sometimes too sensitive, and sometimes a bit unresponsive, but it's usable.
Kind of annoying, but I still love the laptop.
Once you go Mac, you can't go back!
Its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer.
Keyboard is plastic and spongey feeling.
I cannot be happier with the service or product.
Yes, the MBP is more expensive than competing PC laptops.
Those moments in thime where you want to throw something against the wall? Yeah, I wanted to throw that lap top out the window and light it on fire.
It didn't come with any software installed outside of windows media, but for the price, I was very pleased with the condition and the overall product.
this apple navigates you thru the unexplored world of the internet.
Now when I order I did not go full scale for the webcam or full keyboard I wanted something for basics of being easy to carry when I use crutchs or wheelchair and with a backpack laptop bag.
The speed, the simplicity, the design.. it is lightyears ahead of any PC I have ever owned.
Whenever I call Dell about an unrelated problem, they ask me if my laptop is running slowly and if I'd like to purchase more memory for $75.
  The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months, stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes.
Summary: Dont buy HP.
I have no idea how to burn cd's or to use the web cam, just for starters.
This one has had the same effect.
Fan vents to the side, so no cooling pad needed, great feature!
One of them seems to have worked.
This is a great value for the money.
Even so, I like playing online games, so it was wonderful that there is a feature where I can dualboot Windows.
It is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an Alienware gaming machine.
Incredible graphics and brilliant colors.
Everything I wanted and everything I needed and the price was great!
I just plug this into my 22" Monitor and the speedy MacOSX performs just as well on this dual-core that my Dell did with Windows 7 with a quad-core.
Took that one home, same thing.
I bought it to my son who uses it for graphic design.
I contacted Acer and they are giving me FREE recovery DVDs, so don't go and pay for them, just ask for them and they should give them to you.
And the fact that Apple is driving the 13" RMBP with the Intel4000 graphic chip seems underpowered (to me.
Bottom line, if you can afford it, get a Mac!
The battery life seems to be very good, and have had no issues with it.
Seems a much more economical way to get into Apple than their other computers.
I run Dreamweaver, Final Cut Pro 7, Photoshop, Safari, Firefox, MSN Messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time.
  The problems started with just the screen freezing.
And it is impossible to get them back in.
DO NOT BUY GATEWAY COMPUTERS THEY ARE JUNK AND THE WARRANTY COMPANY IS HORRIBLE.
It was a great laptop, ran great and was really fast.
I bought it to be able to dedicate a small, portable laptop to my writing and was surprised to learn that I needed to buy a word processing program to do so.
The battery life was shorter than expected.
can't reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary hardware drivers.
I finally pulled the trigger and I am blown away by how much more I enjoy my computer tasks using the Mac Mini!!!
This a starter notebook.
Instead of taking another chance on Toshiba, I went with an Asus G73JH-x3.
It is the easiest computer I have ever used
The problem I had with this unit was unresolvable.
Got this for a graduation gift for my daughter for her to use at college.
The graphics on this computer are also stellar - very clear and vivid.
Thus, when you carry it at a slanted angle, the screen will "topple" or "slide" down, if you understand what I mean.
You may need to special order a bag.
But the machine is awesome and iLife is great and I love Snow Leopard X.
I took it back to Best Buy where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a new one.
  Worse, for the price I could get a *netbook* that outperforms this machine.
There is NO way I will buy a LG product in the future.
Money and time well spent!
  Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another, and I am not kidding you, I called different hours of the day and you'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again, since they make it sound like they don't have your history list of your calls right in front of them.
I loved it then, but unfortunately it was before the days of wireless internet.
I was given a demonstration of Windows 8.
the screen brightness automatically adjusts.
I have had a total of 5 different laptop from many different manufactures.
I also bought one for my wife, and 3 for my office.
All my devises “talk” to each other.
I've had a Toshiba laptop in the past;
I made a perfect decision when I bought the Toshiba!
I am really heartbroken to have to post a terrible review.
About 1/2 of the sites I need to visit because of my work contain some type of Flash.
Treat yourself to a more expensive, long-lasting laptop of quality like a Sony, Apple, or Toshiba.
Excellent product for the money.
Summary: Spend your money elsewhere
It was just one problem after another for me, and that's reason we had forked out so much money was so we wouldn't have anything to worry about.
Still under warrenty so called Toshiba, no help at all.
i have had my dell latitude for almost three years.
At first when I got this product, I loved it.
It is quiet and a real joy to watch work.
the laptop preformed pretty well.
The OS is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly.
another problem.
Do your research on this issue.
Needless to say, the leap from that to this has been amazing and (aside from the financial reasons) I am astounded that I hadn't made the switch sooner.
It still works and it's extremely user friendly, so I would recommend it for new computer user and also for those who are just looking for a more efficient way to do things
But if you are in the computer field you probably wouldn't be here.
If it's not shipped on the next business day, called on a Friday they are closed on weekends, what was the next step.
HP is more interested in selling extended warranties (which cost more than the netbook new) then they are in helping or fixing.
I'm just really happy that I waited to buy, because this thing kicks a$$!
I also own an HP notebook and it doesn't even come close.
This MacBook is an outstanding product with great value.
Well designed and fast.
It has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp.
Buyers beware.
If you had PC for four years I can almost gaurentee that something would of gone wrong by now, maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer.
I respond that I do not have the old computer...
If you could stretch by a few 100 dollars I highly recommend you should replace your Windows laptop with this one.
And it didn't show up on the reciept, I don't know how we ordered it online!
I thought the transition would be difficult at best and would take some time to fully familiarize myself with the new Mac ecosystem.
I saw this one, and I have the most difficult time trying to use them, they've made great dust collectors, I hate putting this computer down
Still trying to learn how to use it.
Took me 11 hours, 3 trips to different FedEx offices, and brutal conversations with 14 of the worse IT support technicians in the world.
Do yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this laptop.
I also travel with it and it never gives me any problems.
I enjoy having apple products.
-Bluetooth (2.1), Fingerprint Reader, Full 1920x1080 screen -Integrated Mic/Webcam* -Dual touchpad mode is interesting, and easy to use -5 USB ports -Runs about 38-41C on idle, Up to 65 (for me) on load -Very quiet -I could go on and on.
Windows 7 Starter is terrific (no you can't change the background) but I don't need to, I use it just for school work.
The computer was delivered as promised.
I had to get Apple Customer Support to correct the problem.
got another 1, and same issue.
  I have used a couple of others on the job as well.
There is no number pad to the right of the keyboard which is a bummer.
Also, if you need to talk to a representive at Microsoft, there is a charge, which I believe is robbery, since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system, which most people would have went with XP if they could.
They're easy, fun, powerful and will last a long time.
(You may be reading one now!
ANd I babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke.
My computer was one of the best in the school compared to my fellow classmates.
Externally the keys on my keyboard are falling off, after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit, and the screen has a terrible glare.
  I took the laptop home and not even a month later, I began to have problems with it.
This machine is flawless, fast, and classy.
The processor is very quick and effective as I load webpages and applications.
The Unibody construction is solid, sleek and beautiful.
My only other complaint is that it gets really hot.
in May I started having problems with the USB ports not working.
For those that care about noise this thing doesn't really make any;
The durability of the laptop will make it worth the money.
It has worked fine.
:-)If you buy this - don't go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life, and you'll be perfectly satisfied.
I would easly reccomend this laptop to a friend.
The letter A stopped working after the first week.
Far superior to my MacBook.
the only problem is that i had to add 1 gb RAM, the computer was kinda slow.
It still heats up like mad and I am unable to use it with the computer directly on my lap for more than five to ten minutes at a time.
The Final Cut Pro on this laptop is so fast and easy, and I can use this to seemlessly transfer all my work to my home computer, which is also a mac.
I hope this review helps.
I would definitely recommend checking out this laptop if you are in the market for one.
Screen is a bit glossy, but that's not too bad.
There were no scratches or dents or any marks at all.
The sound is nice and loud; I don't have any problems with hearing anything.
HP Pavilion DV9000 Notebook PC      When I first got this computer, it really rocked.
i use my mac all the time, i love the software, the way it takes a short time to load things, how easy it is to use and most of all how you don't have to worry about viruses.
I have never had to shut down the computer unexpectedly and the computer has never froze on me.
System is loosing about 20% of performance because of that.
You know what? I happened to buy a defective blood pressure monitor a week ago at the Bukit Batok Polyclinic NHG Pharmacy a week ago.
I edit and burn to DVD a lot of video, so I obviously could not live with a non-functioning drive.
It's fun to take to a bookstore, sit in the coffee shop area, sign in to WiFi and look up book reviews of books I might buy.
I purchased this netbook after my original Toshiba laptop crashed right after the warranty expired.
It seems they could have updated XP and done without creating Vista.
My last computer, a Toshiba, cost only $400, and worked like a charm for many years.
I just love my Mac!
All I will say now is that it was over two grand less expensive and so much better quality than my hunk of crap Vaio.
I think this ps was manufactured in the mid 90's.
This is my first apple laptop.
Came fully loaded - good.
The built in camera is very useful when chatting with other techs in remote buildings on our campus.
No I am generous calling it slow.
After about a week I finally got it back and was told that the motherboard had failed and so they installed a new motherboard.
The driver updates don't fix the issue, very frustrating.
The display is incredibly bright, much brighter than my PowerBook and very crisp.
  Gradually the freezing screen evolved into a screen that froze in weird shapes.
I sent it to them to fix in perfect condition but for what was wrong with it.
Only other thing is that if you are using this for document creation Apple doesnt provide any kind of word processor (such as works for windows), but iwork is cheap compared to office.
But sitting on a lap or on a desk in front of you it looks more than big enough (this could be because Im used to my Lenovo 10 tablet now) plus this is a great size if I want to unplug the external keyboard, mouse, and monitor to take it with me when I take photos and video.
I will not buy another one.
BEST BUY - 5 STARS + + + (sales, service, respect for old men who aren't familiar with the technology) DELL COMPUTERS - 3 stars DELL SUPPORT - owes a me a couple
The computer did what it was NOT supposed to do, and I didn't know what to do....
Just keep in mind the graphics is not dedicated so loading the movie almost took a minute, but it ran fairly smooth for a non-dedicated graphics card.
I recently purchased the mini and absolutely love it!
Works well, and I am extremely happy to be back to an apple OS.
-When I started worrying for not hearing anything from them, I tried to call.
The 13" Macbook Pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to CA this is the best price we can get for a great product.
I can't begin to say how disappointed I am.
The on/off switch is a bit obscure in the rear corner.
Clearly, there is something wrong with the product and LG didn't take up the responsibility.
the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one.
My computer froze on several occasion, had buttons that randomely would fall off and even had moments when the computer would refuse to turn on at all.
I'm glad I made the choice to switch and buy this MAC.
My macbook is so much better looking and so thin!
So buyer beware when buying Toshiba
BUT there's this application called Boot Camp which allows you to add another OS X like Windows.
And Toshiba is totally unconcerned.
Well, I bought this laptop a month or two ago.
) I also tried the touch pad and compared it to other netbooks in the store.
and looks very sexyy:D  really the mac book pro is the best laptop specially for students in college if you are not caring about price.
A key contributor that led me to Mac is the art aspect.
We were PC users.
I paid about the same for my Toshiba as I did for the compaq a few years back.
It does not even have the software to play a dvd now.
I was really happy because it is a much better price on amazon.com than it was in the Mac store.
Not too much "junk" software to remove.
I've saved a lot of time and headaches so far, using my new MacBook Pro.
It is made of such solid construction and since I have never had a Mac using my iPhone helped me get used to the system a bit.
The Toshiba laptop was a great purchase.
It is always reliable, never bugged and responds well.
I bought this laptop so that the entire family had a computer in the living room;
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse.
I might have read it incorrectly, but better safe than sorry right?
I think that was a great decision to buy
Nothing about it that i don't love, apple always makes a great product.
This just keeps having it's hard drive replaced!
I saved about $100 plus tax ordering on Amazon and since I have prime, it arrived overnight for just $3.99 more.
  It was loaded with Windows Vista Home Premium--delivered with only 1GB of RAM, and it was a *dog*.
I was waiting for this model to be released since January, and have been holding off on buying a Macbook Pro until the new model came out.
I am just amazed.
The touchpad is extremely sensitive, which is the only drawback.
I am so addict to this laptop.
With awesome graphics and assuring security, it's perfect!
The only thing that isn't perfect about this netbook is the speakers, they are not loud at all but I expected that.
Features like the font are very block-like and old school.
Its not just slow on the internet, its slow in general.
THis computer may be small but it is one heck of a power horse.
I've always owned a PC and decided to try a MacBook to see what it's all about.
It has surpassed all expectations and fulfilled all my needs.
It is lightweight and the perfect size to carry to class.
Tried to make a recovey disk wouldnt get passed the first recovery disk.
:] It arrived so fast and customer service was great.
Just what the doctor ordered.
I BOUGHT THEM FOR MY COLLEGE AGE GRANDCHILDREN AND THESE MACS ARE TOTALLY RELIABLE AND SUPPORT THEIR CLASS WORK 100% OF THE TIME.
After doing extensive research, macconnection had the lowest price on the 15" MBP i5.
I like the lighted screen at night.
tech support would not fix the problem unless I bought your plan for $150 plus.
I will have to say that I love my MacBook Pro!
I have owned macbook pros since 2005 and this is the best yet!
The RAM memory is good but should have splurged for 8Mb instead of 4Mb.
It is made better, thicker, and all out tough!
It's fast, light, and simple to use.
Theres also iDVD, a program dedicated to putting all your favorite media together- photos, recordings, video projects into one program so that you can create the perfect memoir for your parents, family, siblings, and any other person important in your life that there may be.
My Toshiba did not have sound on everything, just certain things.
HOW DOES THE POWER SUPPLY NOT WORK!!!
Overall, still a very nice machine.
No big deal.
I will never buy another computer from Dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how I was treated by the company.
Great Laptop for the price, works well with action pack games.
I am not happy at all with the product I purchased.
No HDMI port.
Before I got my macbook, I owned a Dell laptop.
I thought it would be a simple job.
The PhotoBooth is a great program, it takes very good pictures with the built-in camera.
Ok first.
This was a significantly more affordable than getting a new MacBook Pro from Apple.
The Mac mini is about 8x smaller than my old computer which is a huge bonus and runs very quiet, actually the fans aren't audible unlike my old pc
This computer is exceptionally thin for it's screen size and processing power.
The AMD Turin processor seems to always perform so much better than Intel.
i cant believe HP put this out.
  I found this laptop on sale for under 6000 at Best Buy which was a great deal!
Such as PAGES, NUMBERS, and so on.
My wife recently purchased an Apple MacBook Pro and our granddaughter fell in love with it and asked for one for her birthday.
the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have.
HP didn't fix it.
Features such as the Dashboard (allows you to view frequently used tools like a calculator, weather forecast, movie times, calendar, computer post its etc.
Although the price is higher then Dell laptops, the Macbooks are worth the dough.
I wish iWork or MS Office came with the Mac, but MS Office doesn't even come with most pc laptops.
Don't buy this model.
I like it better than my big Dell Laptop.
So, I took it back to the apple store and they narcissist genius bar staff) fixed it by resetting the fan at boot up.
  After the warrenty expired the hard drive went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace.
That is how it is able to function better than any other PC.
I'm going to buy a logitevh c270.
Finally decided to try a MAC because there were too many choices of which PC's to buy and EVERYONE who had a MAC said "buy a MAC".
Laptop is to be used like a Netbook.
The price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop.
You know, using the computer should be fun, not aggrevation, especially when you are playing games or working with photos.
One, owning a mac is essentially a full production studio (in the case of a mac book a portable version).
It's catatonic.
I dont understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing.
so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop.
  I took the computer into Best Buy where I purchased it and they kept it over night to study it.
I had a MacBook Notebook, and it had absolutely no protection from viruses, spyware, malware, etc.
One of the wonderful things about Macs is that they are virus free.
Thinking about returning it
Even if you don't do business, thats okay, it's incredibly fast.
However, I love this particular Mac because its very fast, great size, and has fantastic features like the lighted keyboard and easy mouse pad.
I ve had several calls lasting more than an hour with promises to call back, but the return calls never came.
I can't believe how quiet the hard drive is and how quick this thing boots up.
Every driver on the drivers/applications DVD is everything you will need for a reload.
I had the staff telling me older version did not make the fan noise cause it is a "different" computer.
I have never had it crash, randomly turn off,
To list a few: They tend to get hot enough to cause 3rd degree burns, as well as ignite any flamable material if near the part that happens to heat up.
The keyboard is slick and quiet and not bulky like some other laptops I have had in the past.
Not working = bad
This is an over-sized, 18-inch laptop.
Wireless has not been a issue for me, like some others have meantioned.
The screen resolution was exactly what I was looking for.
Images are crisp and clean.
Also, the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it.
Awesome laptop and the perfect size to carry around in college.
I ordered four D620 laptops.
I will not hesitate to recommend it to family and friends
everything about a mac is wonderful, it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new system, but you will learn fast and its all worth it.
This little netboook is helping me get work done!
I can render AVCHD movies with little effort, which was a problem for most pc's unless you had a quad core I7.
, Applications respond immediately (not like the tired MS applications).
Aside from the trial software and the short battery life, lack of a webcam, its great.
I've had my MacBook Pro for three years now and still love it!
I was starting to boil.
It is super fast and has outstanding graphics.
It looks and feels solid, with a flawless finish.
User friendly, fast and high tech  It is amazing!
The only thing i can say is that the touch pad doesnt work like it should all the time.
I'm new - just switched from years of PC frustration.
this company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this "never" happen...
This is a review of windows vista system.
I would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about.
I have had nothing but problems since the day I took it out of the box!
I was disappointed when I realized that the keyboard doesn't light up on this model.
No laptop is perfect, but sometimes you just find a computer that works for you.
The battery life is excellent, the display is excellent, and downloading apps is a  breeze.
So happy with this purchase, I just wish it came with Microsoft Word.
It had some kind of pre installed software update that completely shut the computer down when you clicked it.
Screen, keyboard, and mouse: If you cant see yourself spending the extra money to jump up to a Mac the beautiful screen, responsive island backlit keyboard, and fun multi-touch mouse is worth the extra money to me alone.
The unibody design is edgy and durable.
A couple things you should know:
I bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market.
I just bought the new MacBook Pro, the 13" model, and I can't believe Apple keeps making the same mistake with regard to USB ports.
I recommend for word processing and internet users.
You can do absolutely anything and is very fast and stylish.
1.You can not change your desktop background (window's 7 starter does NOT support that function).
Its also FUN to use!
I bought this eMachines Notebook PC in January of this year and I am highly dissatisfied with it.
So needless to day, I'm not happy.
I am loyal to Apple.
SO? HOW CAN YOU SOLVE IT? C'mon, I just bought the netbook 2 weeks ago.
She tells me about it all the time but I tend to shut off all cognitive functions when she gets that yapper going.
It had the full sized touch pad with 2 buttons instead of just one.
also...- excellent operating system- size and weight for optimal mobility- excellent durability of the battery- the functions provided by the trackpad is unmatched by any other brand-
No, tey don't even support their own bios and it "could be a problem with the bios" How can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity??!!
I don't want to RUN a computer; I want to USE a computer.
Trashed it when I spilled a latte on it while writing at a cafe.
The latest is on my LG Netbook X12
It was an all around waste of money for me.
The only problem is a lack of screen resolutions!
Pretty disappointed about this product.
I had read online that some users were having sound problems.
It suddenly can not work.
Otherwise, I love it!
I have now had it for 1.5 months and love it.
The nicest  part is the low heat output and ultra quiet operation.
So in late March, early April 2009 I was without it again for a couple weeks while I had online courses I had to complete and my fiance was in Afghanistan and web conferencing was the best communication method we had.
Bought with a credit card.
  They basically told me that the machine would be problem free now.
Does a great job with video shot on a Canon 5D MKII.
they will not let you down.
The ease of use is wonderful.
I currently own a Lenovo laptop as well as my new MacBook Pro, and each have their own strengths and weaknesses.
bought the first asus laptop in san francisco, returned it in santa maria, thinking it was just a problem with that computer.
Luckily, Dell said they would replace my laptop with a new one, but instead I got a refund and bought a mac.
I will also say it is much better than I expected!
NOW AM VERY APREHENSIVE ABOUT TOSHIBA LAPTOPS.
This computer was bought because I wanted "top of the line", fast, reliable, HA.
The graphics were awful and the warranty isn't even worth the cheap payment on the computer.
I could have purchased a cheap computer to do what I'm doing now!
Good laptop for the money.
I then upgraded to Mac OS X 10.8 "Mountain Lion".
now he mows yards so he can earn the money for the wireless internet.
While we struggle with all the crashes and viruses, the kids computers stay consistent and so we caved in and bought one for buisness!
I let my friend borrow it, and she knows nothing about computers, and she used it with ease.
I had to pay $100 for a universal charger for this cheap $300 laptop.
Unfortunately, that is not the case.
I hate it!
Laptops are usually used on the go, so why not give you a better battery?
Mac tutorials do help.
They were great in handling this problem, and I'm looking forward in purchasing additonal products from them in the future.
I gave it to my daughter because I just hated the screen, hated that it had no cd drive to at least play cd's when I wanted to listen to music and do schoolwork.
Haven't regretted it one bit.
I love the size, keyboard, the functions.
Still haven't solved this.
I just hope this expensive laptop doesn't go dead like my friends...it did last him 5 good years before it bit the dust.
Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac.
Very long-life battery (up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings).
If upgrade is possible to the full Windows 7, then I will truly be a very happy geek.
It is good to know that I can mobilize without having to worry about the battery life.
I will never purchase a HP again ever.
Here are the things that made me confident with my purchase:Build Quality - Seriously, you can't beat a unibody construction.
but now i have realized its a problem with this brand.
I can have both OSX and Windows XP running at the same time!
I had purchased it from a major electronics store and took it to their service department to find out what the problem was.
This can be annoying at first but you just have to train yourself not to to start over so far.
PC never worked right even after BIOS fixed.
Much faster than my old windows laptop that died on me.
No temporary replacement, they are out of replacements because "many computers had problems with the Nvidia chipset"-Inquired status of repair.
It's all a bit magical.
I went right out and purchased another laptop.
" This isn't a big deal, I haven't noticed the issue with DVDs or other media, only through USB output.
Ive owned Apple computers and laptops for as long as i could remember.
I can't even turn it off.
Despite the claims of the Apple apologists (a vice of which I am recently myself reformed) the internals of Mac laptops are NO different from PCs' at this point.
It is as good as new.
I thought that it will be fine, if i do some settings.
Great pick for portability and affordability.
It is also fast as can be... you get what you pay for... well worth the investment
The 2 GB of RAM is plenty, able to run Windows 7 and at least 2 or 3 other programs with next to no slowdown.
on the bright side at least I wasn't without my laptop for long this time!
Obviously one of the most important features of any computer is the "human interface.
I reloaded with Windows 7 Ultimate, and the Bluetooth and Fingerprint reader (software) would not load.
I love the quick start up.
The screen takes some getting use to, because it is smaller than the laptop.
Boot-up slowed significantly after all Windows updates were installed.
This unit is not.
The buttons you have to press a little harder than most.
If you have the money I suggest going for the i7.
This laptop rocks (only wish it could run SolidWorks CAD - which Apple doesn't support)!
I liked the aluminum body.
It meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling.
very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent...
I use the computer to basically check emails, surf the web, print coupons and for my college papers.
and the multiple page viewer ( allows you to press one button to see every separate page currently opened at the same time in one screen) are great for those who are working non stop or just shopping online.
I do transcription work on the side, and the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well.
Though please note that sometimes it crashes, and the sound quality isnt superb.
The resolution on the screen is almost pure HD.
I am overall very pleased with my toshiba satellite, I like the extra features, I love the windows 7 home premium.
the mouse is way way way to sensitve.
Returning this as soon as I get out of work
The computer will constantly be getting hot and burning your leg unless you go through the hassle of taking off the entire back of it just to clean out the fan.
Having someone give you a quick tour of how to's is the best.
this Mac Mini does not have a built-in mic, and it would seem that its Mac OS 10.9 does not handle external microphones properly.
I love this program, it is superior to windows movie maker.
UPDATE: Two years after buying this laptop, I am now the proud owner of a lemon.
Having heard from friends and family about how reliable a Mac product is, I never expected to have an application crash within the first month, but I did.
Overall I feel this netbook was poor quality, had poor performance, although it did have great battery life when it did work.
Would HIGHLY recommend this netbook though.
The screen shows great colors.
PDF files can be viewed instantly.
">  iPhoto is probably the best program I have ever worked with: easy and convenient.
I look forward to years of use, it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well.
It was a total Dhell experience that I will never repeat.
!Excelent performance, usability, presentation and time response.
I've installed to it additional SSD and 16Gb RAM.
i try to use it today and I can't logon.
CONS: Price is a bit ridiculous, kinda heavy.
This item is a beautiful piece, it works well, it is easy to carry and handle.
It's now all commodity hardware.
I believe I purchased this in Dec 09 for my primary work laptop which is used 5-10 hours a day, 4-6 days a week.
The sound as mentioned earlier isn't the best, but it can be solved with headphones.
my niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that doesn't require a dedicated video card.
Everything I have tried has worked and I never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome.
Very happy with my purchase.
-Computer crashed frequently and battery life decreased very quickly.
The 17 in Macbook Pro has been a wonderful addition.
I bought my Acer Aspire custom made in June 2008.
I bought this one for my 11 year old and the MacBook Air for my 9 year old.
If you really want a bang-up system and don't need to run Windows applications, go with an Apple;
the features are great, the only thing it needs is better speakers.
Again, I sent it off to Acer, by this time they were paying for me to send it to them and everything, but it was still inconvienent because of my classes and my communication with my fiance.
  By this time I was regretting ever SEEING this machine on the shelf!
I do not like too much Windows 8.
This computer that I have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard functions.
System is running great.
And the fact that it comes with an i5 processor definitely speeds things up
More likely it will require replacing the logic board once they admit they have a problem and come up with a solution.
The first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours.
I have loved this since i took it out of the box.
On the twelfth day that I had the notebook, I decided to go to Dell's website and update it.
Not worth it one bit.
This computer gets very hot, before shutting down.
12.44 seconds to boot.
for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is.
The battery lasts as advertised (give or take 15-20 minutes), and the entire user experience is very elegant.
My dad has one of the very first Toshibas ever made, yes its abit slow now but still works well and i hooked to my ethernet!
I blame the Mac OS.
Keyboard is reasonable size.
Battery is not upgradable to a longer life battery.
Even though I could have gotten a pc twice the speed for the same price I still think there's nothing like a Mac.
i love to use it it is esay and light.
They are about the same size keys.
Couldnt not use it.
In short, you could say your mac could become your best friend (no intention of replacing Rover your dog).
Will certainly use MacConnection again.
pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were.
That's the downside for me.
It works great and I am so happy I bought it.
I have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute.
I think just going from PC to Mac has gotten me totally spoiled and I can't imagine ever going back.
Every day I had this computer, something failed on it.
They claim call center is still down.
It wakes in less than a second when I open the lid.
It is her first laptop and she is thrilled.
  Also, the battery does not last very long at all.
I only wish this mac had a CD/DVD player built in.
Files as well would become lost, deleted or corrupted.
Apple removed the DVD drive Firewire port (will work with adapter) and put the SDXC slot in a silly position on the back.
Wonderful zooming.
There are so many wonderful features and benefits to the new MacBook!
This is by far thee best, most reliable computer I could find.
then on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east.
Vista is a nightmare.
Tech support tells me the latter problem is a power supply problem and have offered to fix it if it happens again.
They are closed at 9pm eastern.
I took it in to the Apple store and guess what? They fixed it, no cost out of pocket.
I would not recommend the purchase of this modle of Toshiba Computer or any Toshiba product for that matter.
In due course, I'll remove the hard disc from this new MacBook Pro and dump it where it belongs - in the trash.
I don't have any technical pearls to share.
I've almost have bought every generation of MacMinis since 2005, and this one hasn't let me down.
  EVENTUALLY we pushed hard enough to convince them that this was the MACHINE that was causing the problems.
The battery life also doesn't keep up with the claim but still I think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack.
The apple care has never failed me, and I expect it to be the same for this computer as well.
This is the first laptop I've owned, althougth I used several at my previous job.
Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase.
This laptop leaves alot to be desired, I have had it only 5 months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice...
  while it was barely a bargin in the begining, i would never purchase another dell and would not recomend the dell brand to others.
Needless to say I told them No and have a nice day and hung up!
Now mainboard is broken, have to wait for a new one.
Good computer and fast.
I'm glad it waited, this one is great.
I enjoy very much my new Toshiba, purchased specifially for attending online schooling.
The guy then said that if I insist on having the hinge tightened, they can do it for me but I have to accept the condition after the "repair".
It drives me crazy when I want to download a game or something of that nature and I can't play it because its not compatable with the software.
I should have spent an extra hundred bucks and got a full sized computer.
Unfortunately, Apple's quality has continued to slide.
can never go wrong with apple products.
I tried out another Mac for a few months before buying this one and it is a great machine.
For my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin (it happened 7 months ago) they offered me an ITouch 8Gig (you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich, offer a loyal customer like me, a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this).
I had less problems.
However, you have to adjust yourself to what it will do, not what you want it to do.
I definitely will buy a Mac again if and when this computer ever fails.
Images can be multi-selected and viewed swiftly or in slideshow mode.
It had most of the features and all of the power that I wanted to replace my desktop machine.
The only issue came when I tried scanning to the mac.
Long story, but after many calls to various  offices, I was told that no one can override the depot and that managers  don't take phone calls or e/mails.
I would tell the technician I knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and I had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me I needed to send the computer in.
A lot of help they WEREN'T!
Not sure how I recommend it for quality gaming, as I have a desktop rig for that reason.
This is the first time that I tried and owning a netbook although I have used 3 different laptops in the past 10 years, I find not much difference except of course for the screen size.
I haven't used it for anything high tech yet, but I love it already.
  I constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed.
Finally was able to reach a young lady in California and ordered the machine and was subsequently given a delivery date.
I've already recommended this laptop to a friend who eye'd the computer when I took it out of my bag.
More times that not the screen pops up saying I have a bad internet connection, or the page can't be displayed.
I just fell in love with this thing.
the key bindings take a little getting used to, but have loved the Macbook Pro.
The only solution is to turn the brightness down, etc.
It has been to early to see if this actually fixes the problem or not though.
The speed is incredible and I am more than satisfied.
I bought the netbook because it was smaller and lighter for me to carry around.
I had to return it because it wouldn't even start.
Somehow the system clock got messed up after reboot.
The speakers are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones I have ever seen in a laptop so if your planning to listen to music I suggest you get something better.
I first purchased this Dell model "1764" on April 6, 201
I bought this laptop on Saturday and am completely in love with it!
I chose the iBookG4, a laptop that is an attractive computer with a large screen big enough to please anyone.
When I called Sony the Customer Service was Great.
They say it could be the motherboard again, but Dell
I love everything about this computer.
Wasn't sure if I was going to like it much less love it so I went to a local best buy and played around with the IOS system on a Mac Pro and it was totally unique and different.
i think that anyone looking for a good durrable laptop then this is the way to go.
Im very happy with this computer!
I left the place angrily.
This is still a fairly good upgrade to a laptop that was about 4 years old.
This was around three years, maybe four years ago.
but it  has a major design flaw.
Also the speakers are not very loud, But it is a netbook.
Fine if you have a touch screen.
Being a PC user for many years to switch to a Mac I will not go back.
Actually, I think I was intimidated by the change from a PC.
That system is fixed.
  After the bad experience with this computer went back to compaq.
It has happened again and I'm being told that it's $175.
Sorry, newegg.
Buying a Mac Mini would allow me to make the transition.
I am not one to throw things like this around but it is a laptop so carrying it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little, while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it.
But to be honest, I don't use my computer for anything like graphics editing and complex data analysis and gaming.
For the Bluetooth to work properly, you must install the Launch Manager on the Drivers/Applications DVD, or it will not show after the reload.
Only thing I would want to add to this is an internal bluray read/write drive.
The MacBook Pro is very sturdy and versatile.
I haven't used the product long enough to write a detailed technical review.
Have one myself and Love it!
I should have bought one a long time ago.
The screen is very large and crystal clear with amazing colors and resolution.
The programs are great, like iphoto (love the editing capabilities), imail (which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad), imovie, etc.
My wife also has problems with her Asus - different model.
I waited to review to make sure it is what it is.
The computer could have been shipped by Priority Mail through the USPS for the same cost and arrived by Noon on Tue.
I never have had a good result with this computer.
big mistake!
I had the computer for a full year and it was a new computer.
Finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a Walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box.
Never been happier using  computer.
I finally made the leap after my Gateway crapped out on me.
My battery went bad about a year and a half after having it and it cost around eighty to a hundred dollars!
I like the design and its features but there are somethings I think needs to be improved.
It's priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box.
I only used it to browse the internet and and I dont know how many times it has spontaniously shut down and it is just a blank screen now.
The last new mac I bought was in 1998.
Using this machine is like a mild form of torture.
So I called, AGAIN.
I will never buy anything from HP again!
it is really expensive though.
The Apple MC371LL/A 2.4Ghz 15.4-inch MacBook Pro Notebook is a horrible waste of money.
I bought it to use in college and it is perfect.
ASUS has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks, and I would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them.
YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET FOR.
After replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working  (3 months of use) which was frustrating.
They discovered the manufacturer's defect and sent it in for repair.
I am totally satisfied with my little toshie!
In my opinion it was not as user friendly as I expected either.
No waiting to have my claim reviewed by someone in another state (or more often, another country).
As a lifelong Windows user, I was extremely pleased to make the change to Mac.
Comfterbale to use light easy to transport.
I noticed windows has a new system called Windows 7, what about us Vista users?  They should get all the bugs out of Vista before investing in a new system.
But other than that I am blown away by all the features this laptop offers.
Apple hit a home run here.
Very disappointed!
I am having a friend look at it , but will probably return it.
It did not have all the features I expected it to have.
  However I dealt with this problem for over a year and it was more of a hastle then I have EVER had with anything.
Three, the mac book has advantages over pcs' with linux based os there is very 'few problems with system performance when it comes to a mac.
May be better for the occasional web surfer.
  I was very excited because this was my first personal computer and I was purchasing it with my OWN money I had recieved from graduation presents.
The computer itself was fast, ran smoothly, and had no problems.
The much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare.
They gave me a hard time yet again, but their was a malfunction in the battery itself, it didn't die.
I also like the acer arcade but these were reallythe only two things I liked about this laptop.
If so, you may be having similar problems.
Iphoto is great for adding pictures right to facebook and other social networking sites.
All for such a great price.
I preferred the fit and feel of the 13 inch.
Took a while to clean it up to my specs.
First the screen goes completely out.
Fits all my personal needs.
Love the stability of the Mac software and operating system.
The keyboard is top notch.
What I'd like is for the laptop to run well without having to purchase additional memory.
I was very worried about making the two compatible- but literally, it was so simple I was almost worried that I was doing something wrong.
The Toshiba laptop I am using is easier to use than most I have tried.
It couldn't have been a better decision.
Summary: I've had this laptop for 2 months, out of the blue the power adapter stops working.
First of all, I've been Dell fan for more than fifteen years.
Right size and weight for portability.
It's absolutely wonderful and worth the price!
After the first few months, the computer started crashing about every week.
It's great and we will always stick with Apple computers, we have been so happy with them.
This version of MacBook Pro runs on a third-generation CPU ("Ivy Bridge"), not the latest fourth-generation Haswell CPU the 2013 version has.
The computer is a dream come true.
I previously owned a Toshiba and it only lasted about 2 years.
THIS LAPTOP WAS BAD FROM THE FIRST DAY OF USE----BROUGHT IT BACK TO STORE FOR RETURN OF MONEY.
The "Time remaining" goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes.
Do you think the shop will give me a new set?? It will NOT!
i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus.
The video card is great for media, and above average for gaming, but not a gamers first choice.
( The iBook backup also uses a firewire connection).
No complaints for an Apple product.
I understand I should call Apple Tech Support about any variables(which is my purpose of writing this con) as variables could be a bigger future problem.
Either way I'm furious.
So, I thought why not give Mac Book pro a try.
Additional caveat: the base installation comes with some Toshiba-specific software that may or may not be to a user's liking.
