were	O
told	O
it	O

an	O
extra	O
$	O

so	O
we	O
went	O
with	O

I	O
did	O

it	O
had	O
a	O

because	O
that	O
was	O

I	O
highly	O
recommend	B-OP
this	O

to	O
anybody	O
that	O
wants	O
great	B-OP
performance	B-ASP
from	O
a	O

would	O
like	O
to	O

Well	O
i	O

this	O

from	O
Best	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
nothing	O

I	O

It	O
is	O
super	B-OP
easy	I-OP

The	O

which	O
defeats	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	O
keeping	O

on	O
a	O

The	O
only	O
objection	O
I	O
have	O
is	O
that	O
after	O
you	O

it	O
the	O
windows	B-ASP

this	O

to	O
anyone	O
looking	O
to	O

In	O
the	O
past	O
few	O
years	O
,	O
I	O
've	O
had	O
terrible	B-OP
experiences	O
with	O
HP	O

Handles	O
all	O
my	O
basic	O
media	O
needs	O
easily	B-OP

Apparently	O
they	O
are	O
defective	B-OP
since	O
they	O
are	O
not	O
securely	O
attached	O

It	O
was	O
just	O
one	O
problem	B-OP
after	O
another	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
's	O
reason	O
we	O
had	O
forked	O
out	O
so	O
much	O
money	O
was	O
so	O
we	O
would	O
n't	O
have	O
anything	O
to	O
worry	O
about	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
not	O
inexpensive	B-OP
but	O
the	O
Hardware	B-ASP
performance	I-ASP
is	O
impressive	B-OP
for	O
a	O
computer	O
this	O

I	O
waited	O
another	O

to	O
"	O
BUILD	O

a	O

It	O
just	O
works	B-ASP
flawlessly	B-OP

All	O
the	O
ports	B-ASP
are	O
much	O
needed	O
since	O
this	O
is	O
my	O

So	O
do	O

it	O

Buyers	O

I	O
dont	O
understand	O
how	O
anyone	O
can	O

this	O
is	O
a	O
great	B-OP
