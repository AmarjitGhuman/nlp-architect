The food was good , the service prompt , and the price very reasonable .
I need at least three rolls to be full , and that 's at least $ 14.00 !
Give it a try , menu is typical French but varied .
It was like the servers forgot that they actually worked there and instead wanted to hang out and be cool .
Our food was great too !
Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens , this is among the best .
Not a great place for family or general dining .
No food snobs allowed , this place is for people who appreciate good food .
But for the Shabu Shabu , you wo n't find much better in NY .
This place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city .
The food is great , I love their dumplings , cold sesame noodles , chicken and shrimp dishs .
The service was excellent - friendly and attentive .
Great for large groups and celebrations - our SUPER HAPPY waiter was the entertainment of the evening .
This place is Italian , not French .
came here for restaurant week , did n't save much , but it was still great .
We ate out in the back patio , which is worth it as it 's cool and the music is hear well there .
Great food ( spinach and corn dumplings and massamman curry ) , very friendly and no nonsense service and a clean and funky bathroom .
Be prepared to wait , because the place is pretty tiny .
Not one to jump to complaints ( hence my lack of previous online reviewing ) , I called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations .
I recommend ordering in on a weeknight .
Pizzas were excellent in addition to appetizers and main courses .
A very inviting restaurant , with friendly service .
Wondering who had the best deals we noticed a line had formed to wait for this one particular establishment .
We parked on the block of Nina 's the place looked nice , with people obviously enjoying their pizzas .
After all that , they complained to me about the small tip .
Just wish they 'd expand .
the icing MADE this cake , it was fluffy , not ultra sweet , creamy and light .
Ca n't argue about that , but they are clearly over priced .
This is a fun restaurant to go to .
We were very pleasantly surprised .
excellent tapas at great prices , romantic , small but not overly crowed , excellent
I absolutely suggest this place .
I was one of the people that went for this horrible experience .
Pricey , but worth a try , at least once .
Good spreads , great beverage selections and bagels really tasty .
Atmosphere is nice and relaxed too ...
Great place , great value .
Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids .
We usually go to the Chart House to celebrate a birthday or anniversary .
The service was great as well .
Food was OK - fish was cooked well .
My wife and I always enjoy the young , not always well trained but nevertheless friendly , staff , all of whom have a story .
Try green curry with vegetables .
Plain and simple it 's bad thai food .
after dining at B.O.G over twenty times now , its official !
The large selection of bruschettas , paninis , tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating .
Emilio , the owner , is often sitting in the front table greeting guests as they come and go .
Looking around , I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen .
Save your money and do n't waste your calories , go to Margharita 's on Washington Street instead , they have amazing food and the BEST service .
Overall I would recommend it and go back again .
Dessert is a joke ... dont bother
I think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation .
The one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side .
Fresh , mind blowing flavors .
They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great .
Old school meets New world .
Can be a bit busy around peak times because of the size .
Love the Jazz bands on Fri and Sat .
I recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal !
I am Indian , and I have tried many Indian places in NY .
IT is the best deal in town for a Monday night dinner at a fine restaurant .
I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine !
Just do n't take the seat between the bar and the back half of the restaurant , i saw a woman get nudged 40times sitting there .
I have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused , and wasted my hard earned money .
What a great place .
The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed .
Glechik might be way too tiny for a restaurant by Russian standards , but it is cozy and the food is simply GREAT .
The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes .
Decent wine selection too .
La Rosa waltzes in , and I think they are doing it the best .
i know , you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored , but my agenda is i 'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends , seeking a pleasant experience .
Everything is always cooked to perfection , the service is excellent , the decor cool and understated .
My friends and I experienced amazing cheese and a delicious , new summer menu at Artisanal last night .
I was wrong .
They sell special sushi , everything have a topping , sauce and etc .
The wait staff is very friendly , if not overly efficient .
Better than the bagel shop on the corner , but not worth going out of your way for , in my opinion .
Whatever the reason it is definitely the place to be .
A touch more jalapeno heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed .
For each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink .
However , it 's not worth a special trip .
I came here for my friend 's birthday and keep coming back ever since .
I have lived in NY for many years and have dined at many restaraunts .
So rude !!!
Go to japanese sushi place or Spanish tapas place - this creation in Williamsburg is a misstake .
I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors .
This is the best Italian restaurant in the city .
The only positive was the wait staff , which was prompt , knowledgable , and likeable .
I 've never felt more unwelcome than last month at Jimmy 's Bronx Cafe .
It 's the conversations that make this a fun place to be .
I love the place .
I have been going back again and again .
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .
The spicy mussels are a highlight .
This restaurant used to be pretty decent .
If you like Sakagura but you feel it 's too much , you 'd better try Yokocho .
we came here on a crowded saturday night and were seated right away despite being 15 minutes late for our reservation .
I recieved prompt service with a smile .
Nice atmosphere , the service was very pleasant and the desert was good .
Went there and had a combination of different seafood dishes and appetizers .
For those prices and the dressed up atmosphere you expect more and should get more .
Want to impress ?
That 's why you have to pay more for that .
this place had ALL the trimmings and i mean all .
Skip this restaurant , it 's a big disappointment .
This little place is wonderfully warm welcoming .
We had Pam 's special fried fish and it was amazing .
The food -- though mostly deep-fried -- is simple and satisfying .
I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible .
As a fan of Thai , I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst .
We wo n't go to this place again for a good meal .
sometimes i get good food and ok service .
I live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of The Pizza Place at 3am .
I do n't get it , what 's so special about Prune ?
Do n't waste money on decor .
Among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants , this offers by far one of the best values for your money .
The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses !
Drinks way over priced .
The lobster knuckles ( special of the day ) were ok , but pretty tasteless .
The martinis are amazing and very fairly priced .
They forgot a sandwich , did n't include plastic forks , and did n't include pita with the hummus platter .
Terrible , terrible management - deserves to be shut-down .
I have been there many times , and food is good and consistent .
Service was warm and attentive , beef carpaachio was exellent ( huge portion ) and pasta was fresh and well-prepared .
the pad se ew chicken was delicious , however the pad thai was far too oily .
Its not curry in a slurry crap , and regular run of the mill food .
Best Taiwanese food in NY !
If you like the food and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants , this is not the place for you .
Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them .
The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out .
And I would have to agree with the masses in terms of service - delivery is their Achilles ' heel .
Appetizer are excellent here ; you can make a great ( and inexpensive ) meal out of them .
Solid wine list , knowledgeable staff , friendly owners and an adventurous , ever-changing menu keep us coming back .
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta ( raddichio was kind of bitter though ) .
The service was a bit slow and the portions are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush , this is not the place for you .
I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee ( rice porridge ) .
peppers , onions , relish , chilli , cheeses , you NAME it .
They had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice - RESULT - WE HAD LARGE CHUNKS OF BURNT RICE IN OUR SERVING BOWL .
I go here at least once every other week , particularly when it 's cold !
Speedy delivers , great food , decent prices , and friendly service combine to ensure an enjoyable repast .
As many other reviewers noticed , your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time .
The food is inventive but still keeps traditional indian flavoring .
The staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check .
Ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me .
From the street it looks very hidden , and is actually an old warehouse .
I was so stunned , and I left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing .
I would not recommend this place to anyone .
i have eaten here on a different occasion - the food is mediocre for the prices .
Sushi was n't anything spectacular for the price .
We were 10 people celebrtating a birthday , we sat in the tent .
The service was extremely fast and attentive ( thanks to the service button on your table ) but I barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order .
As there were so many to choose from we wandered up and down the street looking in the windows and such noticicing many empty seats , except at Taj Mahal .
The appetizers are also delicious !
Just do n't do it .
We liked it so much , that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York .
This place is incredibly tiny .
The cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan .
A con was the slow bar service .
If you 're not familiar with the cuisine , you may encounter problems ordering here and be sure to bring plenty of cash with you as they do n't accept credit cards .
The wife had the risotto which was amazing .
If I wanted to deal with a crappy scene and annoying customers I 'd go out in Manhattan .
That said , I thought Scalini Fedeli was one of the best dining experiences I 've EVER had .
I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong , it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent !!
My roommate and I LOVE this place .
The food is amazing , rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza .
I though it was expensive and I prefer Bella Via just blocks away by far .
Conveniently located too , being right on Bedford ave.
Try the tandoori salmon !
The prices are wonderfully low .
The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach .
Definitely a neighborhood favorite .
The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates .
The service is ok , some of the people did n't get what they asked for .
It is simply amazing .
Indo Chinese food , pretty good ...
The Four Seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of New York City restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say " I 've been to the four seasons restaurant " .
I am not a vegetarian but , almost all the dishes were great .
it is a hidden delight complete with a quaint bar and good food .
The only friendly staff member was the guy at the bar .
We got a little tipsy from the sake but is n't that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about ?
good selection of wines ranging from affordable to high end .
If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible !
They do n't concern much of customer 's health , just want to make money .
Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit .
We love it , and took buses and cabs to get there .
Great food , great waitstaff , great atmosphere , and best of all GREAT beer !
I have eaten at Saul , many times , the food is always consistently , outrageously good .
Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .
Too bad the food was n't of the same heritage .
great for a romantic evening , or a fun evening with friends ...
And cheap !
All the appetizers and salads were fabulous , the steak was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious !!!
my picks : Guizhou chicken , fish with hot bean source , fish fillet in spicy source ( special menu ) .
The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water .
Culinaria is a welcome addition to the Garment district - far better than any restaurant in the area .
So close , but not good enough .
My boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent .
This place has the strangest menu and the restaurants tries too hard to make fancy food .
Tiny dessert was $ 8.00 ... just plain overpriced for what it is .
Will absolutely visit again .
We were treated with attitude ever since the moment we stepped into the restaurant !
For me dishes a little oily , but overall dining experience good .
The waiters were not attentive except that the bill turned up on the table before we were finished .
This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird .
This place survives on reputation alone .
I have been in many restaurants all over the city and Roth 's Steakhouse has quickly become one of my favorites .
We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai .
Great bagels , spreads and a good place to hang out in .
Great roofdeck , nice group of 30 somethings , but no music , kind of quiet .
The food is alright - some stuff is good - some is not ( like the steak dish which tends to be dry ) .
For all of you new to Indian food , try the Paneer Roll , it is a piece of heaven .
While the food was good ( certainly no Il Mulino ) the service was horrendous .
It is very overpriced and not very tasty .
It 's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend .
It 's very spicy but not offensive .
everyone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful .
The food was amazing , and the service was prompt and helpful , but not over-bearing or rushed .
The waiter was attentive .
For authentic Thai food , look no further than Toons .
Buon appetito !
It is run by the same Sichuan chef who started the chain in Chinatown .
I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere that whisks you away to the left bank of the river Seine .
Looking around , I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen .
Rather than preparing vegetarian dish , the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables ( minus sauce , seasoning , or any form or aesthetic presentation ) .
For those of you who do n't know , Uni is Sea Urchin in Japanese , which happens to be my favorite . )
Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm , but the open kitchen is part of the charm .
sometimes i get bad food and bad service , sometimes i get good good and bad service .
Knowledge of the chef and the waitress are below average .
A small , outdoor eating area makes for a private , comfortable space to study alone or meet up with friends .
So , I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it .
Thius is a must for anyone who loves Shabu-Shabu .
But who says Murray 's is anything about service .
This was the perfect quiet , relaxing , and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater .
MMmmm ... it was delicious .
The family seafood entree was very good .
Overall I was impressed and will return , it 's a great QPR ( Quality to Price Ratio ) .
The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary .
I had a great experience .
The portions of the food that came out were mediocre .
Told us to sit anywhere , and when we sat he said the table was reserved .
The place is sleek , modern and playfull and i will return again frequently .
I 've been there a few times , and I usually end up sitting next to some pretty odd people .
The staff is arrogant , the prices are way high for Brooklyn .
My fav was the sassy lassi ...
Toons has recently been redone , so it 's now a very attractive space .
I 'm saving up for my next visit .
( Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer !!!
If you 're craving some serious indian food and desire a cozy ambiance , this is quite and exquisite choice .
My boyfriend had Prime Rib it was good .
This is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates .
I always find myself asking the waiter to make something bland and different than what is on the menu .
Nice restaurant overall , with classic upscale Italian decor .
I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst .
This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls .
Pick a bagel has the best bagels in the city .
The food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare , the dishes are never a disappointment .
Polite acknowledgement is out ;
I wish they had one near my office - I would go everyday .
Also , the staff is very attentive and really personable .
The first 2 courses were very good , but the chocolate sampler was too rich for me and the dessert wine far too sweet .
I came to this restaurant expecting to be surprised but left bored and overcharged .
There are much better places in NY with better prices .
Try everything for that matter , it is all good .
This is such a lovely , peaceful place to eat outside .
Not impressed with the food .
For myself and family we would only go here to celebrate an occassion , I do prefer smaller , quiter restaurants .
My friends and I came across this place while walking in the village .
We will be back .
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny .
The place is absolutely adorable and the food is delicious .
The skillfully chosen Portuguese cheese cart paired with quality port provides the perfect Iberian ending .
JUST AWSOME .
The food is so cheap and the waiters are nice .
The corned beef was tender and melted in my mouth .
I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend .
Dinner took almost 4 hours without any lag time .
The portions are very large and the service is fantastic !!
Fantastic place .
Two wasted steaks -- what a crime !
Incredible food at a very agreable price brings me back just about every other day to this authentic Thai restaurant .
Not to sound too negative but be wary of the delivary .
The only concern i have is with the slighly all-business waitstaff who order and throw the food down , rushing you out .
The ambience is very calm and quiet .
Go inside and you wo n't want to leave .
The waitresses are nice -- also you can just get counter service sit .
Joe 's Pizza used to have the best slice until this pizzeria opened up .
Great Shabu Shabu
So , the menu is written in chalk above your head and it all sounds delicious .
I did n't take a look at the rest menu , but the oysters were fantastic .
It costs $ 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll , but the roll more than triples in size , and that 's not just from the rice .
I was n't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes , but I guess that 's the price you pay for a popular place .
Just moved to the neighborhood and we 've been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants .
BEST DINING EXPERIENCE IN THE WEST VILLAGE !
The happy hour is so cheap , but that does not reflect the service or the atmosphere .
Do n't waste your time , or money !!
During the course of the past 3 months , the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better .
Compared to Ess-a , Tal offers a less doughy bagel !
Great neighborhood joint .
The only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting , the additional menu items are only written in Chinese .
Great food , good wine and an excellent host .
Beautiful experience .
The food was not fresh , the sauces were bland and very oily .
All the money went into the interior decoration , none of it went to the chefs .
if your into thai . . you can not miss this great restaurant .
Maybe the secret was that we went on a Sunday night and everything was great .
Ravioli was good ... but I have to say that I found everything a bit overpriced .
They seemed to continue to rush us along , taking plates without asking if we were done ( my sister still had her fork in hand ) .
I have n't been to the other locations .
As we waited I watched 3 seperate groups of diners discuss how dissapointed they also were .
All the food was hot tasty .
Service here was great , food was fantastic .
We got most of it back at home with us .
My girlfriend convinced me to go in the other night for a quick bite .
Again , if you are in this neighborhood - by all means , come here .
Even my Indian friend could n't believe how good and tasty everything was .
Their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for .
And I 've been to many NYC delis .
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm .
No green beans , no egg , no anchovy dressing , no nicoise olives , no red onion .
Awesome
I live a block away and go to Patsy 's frequently .
Highly recommended .
Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner
The food was delicious ( I had a halibut special , my husband had steak ) , and the service was top-notch .
Yum , the chicken is great here .
It was so bad I actually refused to pay for my food .
The staff was accomodating , the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely .
Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated , we were served dishes we had n't ordered three times , received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served ( and that order was undercooked ) , and charged $ 45 more than we should have been on our bill .
I have never in my life sent back food before , but I simply had to , and the waiter argued with me over this .
Quite frankly , this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried .
It 's just average , just shredded , no seasoning on it .
There was no ambiance .
With all the mundane or mediocre places on 8th avenue it is nice to have one that is a step above in quaility and atmosphere .
I love the fact that the pizza tastes so good and is so cheap .
They could n't even make a salad that was appealing .
Try their plain pizza with fresh garlic or eggplant .
wont come back again for sure !
the dinner menu offers a variety of great entrees , including fresh seafood and huge steaks , there 's also a couple of non-meat alternatives .
It was such a fantastic dining experience , that I returned again the same week .
Entrees include classics like lasagna , fettuccine Alfredo and chicken parmigiana .
If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go .
The waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order .
The service was the only thing good about this restaurant .
While the room is not particularly comfortable , once you 're seated you 'll forget about everything except what 's on your plate .
I recieved prompt service with a smile .
Will never be back .
we were seated at the sushi bar in front of yasuda .
stick with the chicken , beef , and lamb dishes .
Ambiance - relaxed and stylish .
Salads are a delicious way to begin the meal .
Not only was the food outstanding , but the little ' perks ' were great .
No plans to return anytime soon .
Everything is delicious , though , my gf and I come here once a week sometimes - you will get addicted !
The food was absolutely amazing !!
There is usually a wait but it is well worth it .
I had a late dinner at Lucky Stike , a great name for a joint if ever I saw one .
The comments about fried foods is correct ( below ) but the other dishes , including the lamb entree and many of the salads ( avocado shrimp ) were quite good .
Saul is pretty good , but definitely not great .
now called nikki sushi , sushi is OK .
This place is worth an one-hour drive .
the food is decent .
However , I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once .
The food was very good and I was pleasantly surprised to see so many vegan options .
The kitchen however , is almost always slow .
would NOT go back .
Fast service .
My wife I lived on the west side and found this while visiting firends on the UES .
The blond wood decor is very soothing , the premium sake is excellent and the service is great .
My husband and I enjoyed each of the 6 taste size portions and left completely full .
We were less than impressed .
Both were very good , but nothing you could n't get at similar restaurant .
Also , I personally was n't a fan of the portobello and asparagus mole .
If you go here , do it on his off-night .
And I say snacking because it really is not set up to be a proper dinner .
The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes .
And all of that wo n't break your bank !
Try the Times Square cocktail -- ginger lemonade with vodka ( also available without vodka . )
In fact , while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu , and I could n't help telling them that the food was horrible .
Still we keep going back : )
I 'm amazed we have n't been kicked out of this place yet .
I do n't think I would go again .
$ 20 gets you unlimited sushi of a very high quality - I even took a friend here from Japan who said it was one of the best sushi places in the US that he has been to .
I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND .
They 're rude at times , and not very friendly .
Service was prompt , friendly and great .
Been to the one in Brooklyn for over 25 years , now I dont have to go over the bridge for the best pizza .... Hanx
I have n't been to the other locations .
Beautiful experience .
Definately check it out !!!
As many other reviewers noticed , your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time .
Try the Peanut Butter Sorbet and the pizza with soy cheese !
The waitress suggested glasses of wine that went very well with the food .
The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes .
For starters they delivered us someone else 's order .
The dim sum is delectable while the prices are quite easy on the wallet .
Bring your date and a bottle of wine !
Once you step into Cosette , you 're miraculously in a small , off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro .
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested .
Just ignore the trendy wannabes .
too large for just two people but nothing was left .
I absolutely love this place !!!
Great wine , great food .
The staff makes you feel at home , the food is great and the atmosphere is WONDERFUL !
A restaurant that does n't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere .
I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll .
We were worried we would have trouble getting in , but somehow managed to have a short wait .
They are the best bagels I 've had .
Frankly , the chinese food here is something I can make better at home .
I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible .
Warm , comfortable surroundings , nice appointments ( witness the etched glass and brickwork separating the dining rooms ) .
I 'm from sichuan , this is the restaurant I recommend going .
We were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry .
Based on a visit a month ago , I returned the week before Christmas and was hugely disappointed .
The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the service is excellent and it 's great for friends out , a romantic date , or a special occassion .
Our visit their to say the least , was an unpleasant and costly experience !
Quality ingredients preparation all around , and a very fair price for NYC .
We also had shared a house salad that was fresh .
Only drawback - they wo n't toast your bagel , and they do n't make eggs for the bagel .
I am a 100 lb girl , had a glass of wine and a glass of beer prior to the dinner , and I was still HUNGRY after my visit to this place !
I 'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food .
A classic !
The staff offers impeccable service .
I have taken practically every guest that has come to visit me in NY and hooked a few New Yorkers onto Peep as well .
Check it out
My husband and I had a blast .
esp . during happy hour !
in an effort to increase turnover , the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary espresso cup filled with chocolate mousse .
I just do n't understand all the hype ...
Its an excellent place to relax and the food is one of the best in the city of New York .
A real dissapointment .
I 'm sure I 'll return for a final judgement tho .
I highly recommend this beautiful place .
This diamond in the ruff is definitely worth my 10-minute walk from the 6 train .
The Dancing , White River and Millenium rolls are musts .
The red sliding doors may be unique but they do not block off the cold air from the outside .
Eat at your own risk .
I 've read some of the previews reviews - people are either not New Yorkers or have more appreciation for ambience then food .
The servers give you some sample slices of your order while you wait ( shortly I might add ) .
. the best I 've found outside of the Chinatown masters .
The food was wonderful and imaginative .
Single Worst Restaurant in Manhattan
Their eggplant is so delicate , sweet tender !
Fish was overdone .
Good food at the right price , what more can you ask for .
I came here for my friend 's birthday and keep coming back ever since .
The setting is casual and romantic .
I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken .
I would go back .
We left after one drink .
The pizza is good though .
The counter service is bad .
Drinks : 2 glasses of Dom Perignon at $ 35 each .
Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit , but the food was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues .
My chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin .
I did n't go there for food so I ca n't comment .
Highly recommended .
but I would n't wan na live there .
it is not consistent .
Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you .
Slow service , but when you 're hanging around with groups of 10 or 20 , who really notices ?
As a retired hipster , I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city .
Maybe tomorrow ; - )
Most importantly , it is reasonably priced .
Everything at Sala Thai is tasty and well-portioned .
The quality of food at this restaurant accompanied by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10 !
The crust is thin , the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly .
The all you can eat deal is truly amazing here .
Loved it
They are tasty , but I suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average American digestive system .
The food is decent at best , and the ambience , well , it 's a matter of opinion , some may consider it to be a sweet thing , I thought it was just annoying .
Everything we had was pretty good , but we have only been there once .
I 'd definitely recommend this little place .
The combination of fresh tomato sauce , fresh mozz cheese , basil and the dough they make with imported flour , makes this is one of the better pizza 's in NY .
They 're are better Taiwanese restaurants and they are located in Flushing , Queens .
Its a nice quiet location to go eat a good meal , relax , be able to talk and have a very good time .
I will be going back very soon .
Plus they made a perfect martini .
( Besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city ) .
Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem !
A Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner ?
Ask for Usha , the nicest bartender in manhattan .
No thanks !!!
Get the tuna of gari .
Definitely something to come down and check out .
I do n't like Indian food too much and this was delicious , however you want to factor that into the equation .
I 'm going back .
Our son loves pizza and we have a certified Neapolitan pizzaria in our home city ( Seattle ) , we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant .
Oh and it 's too tiny for families with strollers .
This is a real gem of a place .
We had the lobster sandwich and it was FANTASTIC .
This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie ( that do n’t serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city !
But when you are seated the waitresses are great , they explain everything on the menu , and the price of the food is really cheap for the service you get .
People are always friendly .
Inside is a little cramped , but to be expected .
Now it 's so crowded and loud you ca n't even talk to the person next to you .
For asian fusion , there are many places further downtown .
Food was very good , but not what I would consider out of this world .
I have been to Mary 's many times and I like it .
Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES , I get angry that I did n't just go to Zucchero Pomodori .
I 've made the trip out here a few times with a friend who lives nearby ( I live on UWS ) .
I am going to the mid town location next .
The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well .
Despite the 5th ave address there are no frills whick I also love .
At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at Bark you do n't just get your average hot dog .
The bibimbap was average , but the stone bowl was n't even close to sizzling .
I like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing .
Kenny the owner is always there and he treats my family like we are part of his family .
It took them 25 minutes to bring our appetizer .
The food was excellent - authentic Italian cuisine made absolutely fresh .
Great spot , whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner .
Amazing food .
Overall , worht every penny .
( Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer !!!
We arrived for dinner expecting to be impressed by a place that has an impressive past - but , that 's just it -- the PAST !
do n't get me wrong - sushi was good , just not fantastic .
Yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken .
The pickles were great addition .
Just bring someone who speaks Cantonese because waiter may not understand you .
Please if your thinking about it go , and stay the wait you wo n't be disappointed .
The service was quick and friendly .
Good food .
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently .
We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful .
It hits the spot every time
The food was well prepared and the service impecable .
My personal favorite is Nick and Joe 's .
The service is awful .
Always a nice crowd , but never loud .
Never fails to please .
We were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion ... a bucket of food literally .
Had we been stalling I could understand where they were coming from , but we had been there less than an hour and they had n't even brought us a check yet !
The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries I received from one of the food runners , which is not good considering the bill was nearly $ 100 .
All the staff is absolutely professional !!
It is a small restuarant so go early and it will be nice and quiet - go late and it will be packed !
The corned beef and pastrami are excellent , much less fatty than those big tourist places around Times Square .
The table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the service industry , I understood they were busy .
service is friendly , and never had a problem walking in and getting a table .
I went here in the afternoon with a friend .
Just stick with the small dishes !
The white bean brushetta to start was incredible and the pasta was phenomenal .
And as SOON as one person is done , she asked to pick up the plate immediately .
Wo n't or Ca n't is not in the service directory .
Really Lovely dining experience in the midst of buzzing midtown area .
The sushi was awful !
However , they 've got the most amazing pastrami and the soups hit the spot .
You get the sense that the people there care about their restaurant and about your experience and that is very nice .
Very good wine choices .
I 've eaten at many different Indian restaurants .
THe perfect spot .
The wine list is interesting and has many good values .
They have great rolls , the triple color and norwegetan rolls , are awesome and filling .
The ambience is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt service .
I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere !
We had a very nice time .
It 's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone .
I 've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times , but more often I order delivery .
The service was typical short-order , dinner type .
The wait staff is pleasant , fun , and for the most part gorgeous ( in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way , not in that she 's - way-cuter-than-me-that-b @ # $ * way ) .
We were wondering why they were there to make our dining experience miserable ?
Taxan delicious !
The ambience is also more laid-back and relaxed .
Fish was overdone .
Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant .
Terrible , terrible management - deserves to be shut-down .
Go here if you want fresh and tasty salads of any type you can imagine .
The staff was very attentive , the ambience lovely , and the food superb .
Great pizza and fantastic service .
I do not recommend lunch specials just because it tasts the same with other regular chinese restaurant .
Not only was the sushi fresh , they also served other entrees allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy ( try the duck !
Excellent lunch buffet for only $ 6.95 .
They have authentic Indian at amazin prices .
Do n't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes , they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections .
The food is also outstanding and is served quite quickly .
A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning !
We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town .
The staff is 100 % Italian and the food is as authentic as it gets .
Their calzones are horrific , bad , vomit-inducing , YUCK .
Hands down the best pizza on the planet .
The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger , to steak , to escargot .
What ?
At peak times , the restaurant is overcrowded and tables are uncomfortably close .
We were n't !
yourself a favor and have dinner here and see if you dont agree with me .
The staff is n't the friendliest or most competent , and I am stickler for service , but everything else about this place makes up for it .
I thought this place was totally overrated .
The mussles were the fishiest things I 've ever tasted , the seabass was bland , the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese , the penne w / chicken had bones in it ... It was disgusting .
The svc can be a bit rude at times , esp if you have big group , but overall the restaurant is a must !
Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth .
Have to tell you : Not at all impressed .
Warning : You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu !
My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary , and to our surprise it was fantastic .
This should have been done in a back room - away from customers .
Great value for the quality ingredients .
You ca n't say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown .
Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant !
The entrees were served with miso soup and rice .
The food here does a great service to the name ( Cantonese that is ... ) .
For sure i will keep coming back because i feel really this restaurant deserves .
Is just the way it was in days gone by .
The food was excellent as well as service , however , I left The Four Seasons very dissappointed .
For the price , you can not eat this well in Manhattan .
They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great .
Eating in , the atmosphere saves it , but at your desk , it 's a very disappointing experience .
While we thoroughly enjoyed the food , it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation .
We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods .
I really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi ( on saffron risotto-yum ! ) .
At this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the waitress WALKED away .
they were dry and disgusting , i did n't even finish my first piece .
The food is good , especially their more basic dishes , and the drinks are delicious .
A bit breezy up there on the mezzanine from the wind coming from the tracks .
The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed .
All the pastas are fantastic and the homemade lasagna is some of the best that I have had in the City .
It 's worthwhile to take a cab to Chelsea just for an awesome dinner at My Chelsea .
It gets very crowded so I would suggest that you get their early .
But regulars know that the sandwiches are the real star here .
several times and put up with the waiters ' bad manners , knowing that their job is n't easy .
When we walked in it seemed like it was there for 200 years .
What can you say about a place where the waitress brings out the wrong entree , then verbally assaults your 80 year old grandmother and gives her lip about sending it back ( which she did politely , by the way ) .
It was pretty inexpensive too .
The stuff tilapia was horrid ... tasted like cardboard .
The food has been consistant for years and it never lets you down .
The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale .
The service we experienced was friendly and good .
Not sure where the previous reviewer , lonk , dined , but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food !
The service was bad , the food took to forever to come , we sat on the upper level .
Great staff .
I have been going there since it opened and I ca n't get enough .
The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that I could barely eat it , and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish .
For someone who used to hate Indian food , Baluchi 's has changed my mid .
I had the mango chicken and i ca n't go on to tell you how delicious that was and the presentation was beatiful .
Awsome Pizza especially the Margheritta slice .
Everything I had was good , and I 'm a eater .
This place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city .
The pizza was great .
Our experience did not ever get any better .
Being serious sushi lovers , we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action .
but the food was delicious .
You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert .
Restaurant was dirty and unkempt .
Will prob . not return but it is a great dinning experience to try atleast once .
Anyhow , we were able to sit as long as we wanted and chat , which was nice .
I 've been several times and am totally smitten .
The prices and ambience are especially great considering it 's in the West Village .
No plans to return anytime soon .
The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .
I think I 've had some the best meals of my life at minnow .
I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree , which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better .
- for dessert we split chocolate cake and vanilla gelato ( with espresso ) , which were tasty , but I thought a bit overpriced .
I recommend the garlic shrimp , okra ( bindi ) , and anything with lamb .
The place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious .
we love th pink pony .
Over the years the host , Vittorio , and his crew , have always treated me as family -- although with all the business this not-so-little gem does , it amazing he 's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor .
Even upon delivery , their juicy pork buns are quite good . .
The food we ordered was excellent , although I would n't say the margaritas were anything to write home about .
Food-awesome .
The highly spiced chai tea was great too .
Terrible experience .
People dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans .
We were n't even at our table for more than an hour total .
The service was excellent and the food was delicious .
My husband said he could 've eaten several more , the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had .
Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights .
my wife and i have been going to nyc for years and would n't miss roxy , s food is expensive but it 's new york !
I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service .
We all ate pasta entre'es , which were great .
The nakgi-bokum was horrible .
Not to be overlooked , the service is excellent .
The restaurant has a Family feel , not least with regard to the portions which are enormous ; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine .
Oh , and there 's hookah .
What a difference , the service was very comforting and the food was better than average , but what really standed out was such a dynamic and extensive beer list .
I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst .
I asked for a simple medium rare steak .
Best Reuben sandwich ever !
They are amazing !
it 's delicious !
Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there .
Never again !
The wine list is also really nice .
I highly recommend it .
Service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great .
However , I do not understand the extraordinary hype about this restaurant .
Off the beaten path , this jewel of a restaurant shines just one block away from the plethora of 6th street Indian restaurants .
Killer Sushi !
THE BIG COMPLAINT : NO TOASTING AVAILABLE .
Finally , I got sick of the bad service , obnoxious smirks , and snotty back talk .
How do you rate home ?
Once you step into Cosette , you 're miraculously in a small , off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro .
Taj Mahal offeres gret value and great food .
The music is the best among all the Indian restaurants I have visited .
This is the BEST Shabu-Shabu Restaurant in the Try-State Area .
Sometimes tables do n't understand his sense of humor but it 's refreshing to have a server who has personality , professionalism , and respects the privacy of your dinner .
Brava La Pizza Fresca !
Definitely Highly NOT recommended .
Had no flavor and the staff is rude and not attentive .
The Thai ice tea was amazingly smooth and yummy !
Service is excellent , no wait , and you get a lot for the price .
At $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you 're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture .
The place 's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh .
It was good , but none of the flavors WOW .
during busy hrs , i recommend that you make a reservation .
To dine at Thalia can be slightly deceiving because while its beautiful on the outside , its so bland on the inside .
I 'm telling you ...
All in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side , but fresh .
Give it a try and enjoy .
for out-of-towners who will get a big thrill out of the location !
Simple healthy unglamorous food cheap .
I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .
My husband and I take out from here 3-4 times a month .
I got hair in my food 2 times of then !
A cool bar with great food , and tons of excellent beer .
Waiters are very friendly and the pasta is out of this world .
The service , wine selection , ambiance are all outstanding and deserve recognition .
It was raining , and we figured why not ?
Service was also very good .
We 'd go back again
The flavors are great , and the menu is extensive .
Great Atmosphere
Food is excellent .
We a menu that rearely changes , e xcept for one or two specials , the quality and care they put in thier food in evident .
they were able to squeeze me in at 6 after i called the night before my anniversary for a friday night reservation and told me they 'd treat us well for the occasion .
Good service , great food , good value , and never have to wait in line !
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money .
Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant !
The Pad thai , lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but , I 've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places .
When the bill came , nothing was comped , so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine , but I did n't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it .
The palak paneer was standard , and I was not a fan of the malai kofta .
Our teenage kids love it , too .
it helps if you know what to order .
The only thing the waiters do n't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave .
We called the other person who was very close by , and she told us to order for her , so we did .
Best Chinese on the Upper East , prompt delivery , good value .
It 's called Gnochi alla nona and is found under Chef Specials .
The service was excellent and the food was delicious .
And amazingly cheap .
The menu consisted of standard brassiere food , better then places like Balthazar etc .
The calamari comes with an incredible sauce , and the duck noodles are yummy as well .
Service was excellent , and the AC worked very well too ( thank God , it was hot ! ) .
Slightly on the pricey side but worth it !
My friends settled for rice dishes , but we came back the following day to try the dim sum , which was good ... not outstanding , but good .
I love Indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it .
I love this place
There was only one waiter for the whole restaurant upstairs .
They are served with a free appetizer and the portions are perfect for lunch .
The place is a lot of fun .
I highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try .
I ca n't wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic patio .
A hearty two thumbs up !
I really recommend the very simple Unda ( Egg ) rolls .
Service is known for bending over backwards to make everyone happy .
The flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal .
I would highly recommend this place !
Love YUKA .
And you never get the feeling that you need to leave .
The service is a quite slow , but friendly .
As much as I like the food there , I ca n't bring myself to go back .
Always busy but fast moving .
Also , the place is popular with families , so if you 're bothered by children running loose like wild animals , come later at night to avoid them .
Its not the same if you have to sit inside .
I 'm glad I did as the food was very good and the staff was friendly , courteous and efficient .
I came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband .
Hip boutiques and bars on Ludlow add to the artsy , laid-back atmosphere at this Israeli-style takeout and eat-in burger joint .
They are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in Yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey .
Everyone who works there ( the host , the bartender , the servers ) is so helpful .
I have never had anything like it !
We got a little tipsy from the sake but is n't that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about ?
amazing fresh dogs but best of all endless toppings !!!
I live nearby and when they first opened , I ate there a lot .
For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .
Katz 's deli is a great NY experience .
The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion ( maybe 3 of each ) .
the food was undercooked-the sauce watery , and the vegetables raw .
If you ' re in New York , you do not want to miss this place .
The pasta penne was pretty extra buttery , creamy which means a big task to diggest . . tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count , penne ... got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed ... lol
These are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner :
This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money .
I come from a family of pizzeria owners , and I 'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in Fornino 's blows my families receipies away .
Acceptable prices .
Visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews .
The bagels always warm , soft on the inside , crispy on the outside and enormous in size .
An excellent service
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience .
You can not go wrong with this place .
A plus was the good mix of people in their twenties that provided for great eye-candy while I was there .
I ca n't imagine how much worse it would have been if we 'd gone at a prime time !
Do yourself a favor and walk the extra avenue from joe 's to eat here .
Easily the worst stir-fried squid I 've ever tasted .
I will never visit this restaurant again .
Most importantly , food is excellent .
We were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks .
For appetizers , I recommend the shrimp fritters and dumplings .
There are many Thai places in the city but so far Toons is # 1 .
And forget what you read under me , the atmosphere is n't that bad either .
In such a crappy part of town to find a good value for lunch , this place is great .
The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
There are no negatives to speak of .
good variety but nothing surprising .
They showed up 15 minutes after the tuna melt .
Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you .
But if you 're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary , then this is the place to go for Indian food
It 's not mind-blowing , but to me , thai food never is and never will be .
They came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant .
The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were .
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you wo n't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME !!!!
The food is yummy , especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries .
Three of us arrived for dinner about 5:30 on a week night without reservations .
this place is amazingly bad .
The man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7 , then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving ( mean while there were boths open all around ) .
The cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan .
Just want to warn you all - do n't waste your time and money .
The service is fine and they allow you to enjoy the view .
Sit back in one of those comfortable chairs .
I ordered the chu chu curry and my friend ordered the pad thai chicken .
The food is great ( big selection , reasonable prices ) and the drinks are really good .
Young neighborhood trendies graze at the counter during the day , while chic , art-house drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night .
The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date .
The food is consistently wonderful - I 've been coming here for years , and the owner has always been accomodating and friendly .
Leon is an East Village gem : casual but hip , with well prepared basic French bistro fare , good specials , a warm and lively atmosphere .
Appetizers took nearly an hour .
When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets , and then ordered for them .
Service is top notch .
Not a great place for family or general dining .
The guac is fresh , yet lacking flavor , we like to add our fresh salsa into it .
despite the untasteful previous review ...
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly .
go here for the drinks !
There is nothing more pleasant than that .
keep up the good work .
How can hope to stay in business with service like this ?
I had the black cod with yuzu sauce , which was wonderful .
The food is delicious and beautifully prepared along with the friendly and personable service .
The website and rating makes this place look wonderful but in reality it was very disappointing .
I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries .
I went there with my friend last saturday .
Do n't judge this place prima facie , you have to try it to believe it , a home away from home for the literate heart .
They charge different prices all the time .
I just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal for such little money .
Where Gabriela personaly greets you and recommends you what to eat .
Service is average .
Also they were $ 15 each !
The quality of the meat was on par with your local grocery store .
You will not be dissapointed by any of the choices in the menu .
A guaranteeed delight !
Dessert - ca n't be missed , so save room !!!
Going to Volare is like going to your favorite aunt 's house for dinner , assuming that your aunt is a great Italian cook .
What more could you want ?
Not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring .
We 've always gotten amazing service and we love the food .
We will be back .
SUM IT : do n't read the ' 10 's ' reviews , try it to judge for yourself so you wo n't have as hi expectations , then you 'll be sure to enjoy it .
Decor leaves something to be desired .
Perhaps the last reviewer ( who stated she was treated with attitude ) lives in a parallel universe because I have never had anything but a perfect experience at Yasuda .
Every time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street .
The waiters are very friendly and helpful and if you frequent they will remember you .
Had a great meal there this weekend before heading to the movies !
Their Margarita is best I 've had since I 've returned from Naples !
But the pizza is way to expensive .
Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS !
I almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded .
I have to say that if this what makes it easier to get a saet a lunch - I dont mind .
great taste
It will be on my to do list the next visit to NYC .
It seems like this is a place the locals like and the people working here liked it too .
The seafood is amazing , there 's a good wine list , and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises .
And the staff is also young , energeic and hot !!!!
Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
Our waiter and all of the people helping him were attentive and genuine .
But the service is HORRID !
In reality ( to maximize potential diners ) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby .
The menu looked good , except for offering the Chilean Sea Bass , but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside .
Have recommended the place to friends , always gets good response .
I love the simplicity and respect which was given to the food , as well the staff was freindly and knowledgable .
Like others have said , do n't expect the restaurant to make a nite out romantic for you and yes , a busy restaurant may require you to wait .
oh speaking of bathroom , the mens bathroom was disgusting .
I would definitely come back to this restaurant .
However , in the summer of 2003 , it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup .
We were looking forward to nice glass of Sangria when we arrived .
If you are a vegetarian , this really is n't a good place to go .
Food is great .
This is a true gem of the village .
I noticed alot of indian people eatting there which is a great sign for an indian place !
The service was attentive , yet unimposing , the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced .
The meat dishes were only so-so .
By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers !
Also very inexpensive .
When the dish arrived it was blazing with green chillis , definitely not edible by a human .
We went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different .
First went here to enjoy their garden terrace .
Really though , where 's the seasoning ?
No dress codes , no attitudes , plenty of comfort companionship , a great place to relax in an always busy Midtown .
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose .
A great addition to Smith Street : finally , a place that 's not pretentious and filled with women wearing Ugg boots .
I love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants makes the food fine cuisine , even with no idea how to use them .
The garlic mashed potatoes are hands down the best in the city !
My wife and I visited Dokebi tonight .
They are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine , so if you want to make a reservation you are limited .
We were n't even at our table for more than an hour total .
Love it .
Terrific menu full of unique rolls and special dishes .
Okay , so I never write but there does n't seem to fair balance of positive to negative reviews concerning Green Bo and it 's time to speak up - I live in Chinatown .
I am happy i did the food was awsome .
The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes .
I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee ( rice porridge ) .
My daughter 's wedding reception at Water 's Edge received the highest compliments from our guests .
Me and my girls will definitely go back .
It 's traditional , simple italian food .
My wife and I recently visited the bistro for dinner and had a wonderful experience .
Over the years the host , Vittorio , and his crew , have always treated me as family -- although with all the business this not-so-little gem does , it amazing he 's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor .
Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town !
It was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York , and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to New York .
After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner .
Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers , no matter what the reviews say .
In addition , the food is very good and the prices are reasonable .
I have been to Roth 's twice and both times were very disappointing .
Terrible would be a compliment !
Bukhara Grill , the tagline says it all . . " INDIAN SPICE RAVE "
The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that .
I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one .
In the end you end up with a fair tab and NOTHING BUT A GREAT TIME !!!
Food is usually very good , though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders .
In any event , this is a place I 'll be sure to stop by again when I 'm in this part of town .
Interesting other dishes for a change include chicken in curry sauce and salmon caserole .
This was the perfect quiet , relaxing , and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater .
I went here with my boyfriend and another couple .
Their sake list was extensive , but we were looking for Purple Haze , which was n't listed but made for us upon request !
While the place is not a hotspot hangout , the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck .
wow ! how have i missed this one , tried Long Tan last week for the first time and now know what the NY TIMES and many more in the neighborhood already knew .
They do n't concern much of customer 's health , just want to make money .
I have never been disappointed but their true strength lays in their amazingly delicious and cheap lunch specials .
Everything was wonderful ; food , drinks , staff , mileau .
My bf and I go to the walk-up counter and order a pie .
We ended up having to just leave because we were essentially being ignored by the wait staff -- even though the rest of the restaurant was largely empty .
The decor is what initially got me in the door .
Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable .
The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices .
Disappointingly , their wonderful Saketini has been taken off the bar menu .
Yes , the prices are high , but I felt it was worth it .
the spinach is fresh , definately not frozen ...
The food was really good , I had the onion soup and it was one of the best ever .
The food was spicy and delicious .
Their sake martini is wonderful .
believe us , we 've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs .
the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded :) :) : )
I was there on sat .
My friends and I were on vacation in NY and was referred to Chance by a friend .
There is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me .
It 's a basic pizza joint , not much to look at , but the pizza is what I go for .
The food was very good , a great deal , and the place its self was great .
The service is always bad though , do n't expect much of anything from your server , and I would not recommend bringing a date here either .
The food is so good and so popular that waiting can really be a nightmare .
All in all we 're already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks !!!!
Nice Family owned traditional restaurant .
If you have a dumpling fetish i suggest you try some here !
I was highly disappointed by their service and food .
Even though its good seafood , the prices are too high .
SEA has become so popular that they 've let it go to their heads .
I like the ambience , it 's very dark and original .
Just because it 's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty , IT IS GREAT !
This is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together .
jazz singer had a nice voice + she made us all get up to dance to shake some cals to eat some more .
Be sure to try the seasonal , and always delicious , specials .
I am amazed by the poor reviews - I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian - great prices , great atmosphere , good service and a wonderful wine list .
Fresh veggies , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , rice , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .
The anti-pasta was excellent , especially the calamari , as were the filling pasta mains .
Also , specify if you like your food spicy - its rather bland if you do n't .
Authentic food and they have REAL service , not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door .
The wine list is excellent .
I started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two .
The food is good , especially their more basic dishes , and the drinks are delicious .
The main downside to the place is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level .
Nice ambiance , nice little bar , good bartender , Francois , and good service .
It 's a small cute restaurant .
Curioni 's Pizza has been around since the 1920 's .
We ate outside at Haru 's Sake bar because Haru 's restaurant next door was overflowing .
it 's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food .
One of the BEST
Everyone must come here at least once .
My sister says it reminds her of a restaurant run by high-school students who do n't know what they are doing .
Then they somehow made a dry and burnt crust , around a raw and cold inside .
I for one will never patronize them again .
The food is wonderful , tasty and filling , and the service is professional and friendly .
You want to have a real hot dog in Brooklyn ?
But on a lazy Saturday night , we ended up going .
Also , specify if you like your food spicy - its rather bland if you do n't .
the wait staff is very friendly , if your not rude or picky ....... our meal at Leon last weekend was great - .
Over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals .
The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive .
Wish NY had more of these kind of places : intimate , superb food , homey , top notch all the way around , certainly worth the wait .
This is the perfect spot for meeting friends , having lunch , dinner , pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks !
This restaurant is such a great place .
Service is friendly , prices are good - delivery time was a little slow , but for the way this pizza tastes , I 'm willing to overlook it .
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices .
If we were to move from the upper east side , we would genuinely miss this restaurant .
This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets , with that certain Parisian flair .
However , go for the ambience , and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world !
However , I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once .
I would go back tho .
I drop more dollar bills here than your uncle after a weekend at Scores .
The dim sum is ok but does n't taste that fresh , and the little dishes do n't look steamy hot as they should ( also note lack of Chinese here ) .
Try the lasagnette appetizer .
I ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor .
I lOVE THIS PLACE !
The staff has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often .
Our waiter was fine , the place looks nice in that not-trying-too-hard way , but at those prices , a little more should be expected of your food .
The mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert ... definitely going to be back very soon .
The service was pretty poor all around , the food was well below average relative to the cost , and outside there is a crazy bum who harasses every customer who leaves the place .
I must say it 's a little pricey for the food because it was not as spectacular as the view .
The service is outstanding and my crab-cake eggs benedict could not have been better .
Others have to go to other restaurants and feel sad until they 're eaten .
It was totally overpriced - fish and chips was about $ 15 ....
You can get a completely delish martini in a glass ( that 's about 2 1/2 drinks ) for $ 8.50 ( I recommend the Vanilla Shanty , mmmm ! ) in a great homey setting with great music .
But $ 1 for each small piece ???
We ordered the chicken casserole , but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken , all dark meat and on the bone .
And they have these home made potato chips at the bar that are the most delicious things in the world !
I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks !
Have the iced tea .
I have tried literally every restaurant on curry row .
I tried a couple other dishes but was n't too impressed .
If only they delivered , they 'd make a mint !
What 's the difference between the two ?
It 's a steal !
This is the perfect date spot for Williamsburg couples .
I pray it stays open forever .
As a student in NYU i need a place to eat after a hard day of work so usually i just go to any indian restraunt near by .
This place is a must visit !
If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you 'll love it here .
But after last night , Spice Grill is the only place I 'm eating indian cuisine .
Indoor was very cozy and cute .
The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation , so a casual lunch here would probably be best .
Average to good Thai food , but terrible delivery .
I look forward to eating here again
Here you get the zen feel without feeling rigid .
A one women show !
The food is great and the prices are reasonable .
Ive been here so many times the waiters know my name .
I completely recommend Casa La Femme for any special occasion and to REALLY impress your date .
This place blew me away ... by far my new favorite restaurant on the uppereast side .
I found this restaurant to be one that truly values its patrons .
Ambience is so cute and quaint , good for business although we were there on vacation .
The establishment scores big points in presentation and style .
Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most .
I always get the Shabu-Shabu dinner and the beef is always fresh .
Great food , amazing service , this place is a class act .
Not much of a selection of bottled beer either , we went with Brahma .
The food is decent at best , and the ambience , well , it 's a matter of opinion , some may consider it to be a sweet thing , I thought it was just annoying .
El Nidos one of the best restaurants in New York which I 've ever been to , has a great variety of tasty , mouth watering pizza 's .
Everything about this restaurant was special .
Too bad I had paid an extra $ 2 for the stone bowl .
I HAVE NEVER HAD A BAD MEAL ( OR BAD SERVICE ) @ PIGALLE .
the food is delicious and highly recommended .
Service and food is what any one would expect when spending that type of money .
Not worth the prices .
Had 1 appetizer , 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the bill was ~ $ 55.00 , not including tip .
They have some great entrees here as well .
The lone argentine chorizo appetizer at $ 8.95 was a heavy fennel flavored Italian sausage like the ones that sell for $ 2.99 / lb at the store .
Growing up in NY , I have eaten my share of bagels .
$ 170 down the toilet ...
Did I mention that the coffee is OUTSTANDING ?
The entire place and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt .
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included : ceviche mix ( special ) , crab dumplings , assorted sashimi , sushi and rolls , two types of sake , and the banana tempura .
Ambiance and music funky , which I enjoy .
When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not Mcdonald 's , every place makes things differently While it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude .
We went to eat at the Jekyll and Hyde restaurant on Friday night and really enjoyed the fun atmosphere and good food .
Went there for an office lunch .
The food arrived 20 minutes after I called , cold and soggy .
The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing !
Have never had a problem with service save a missing rice once .
Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood .
It is terrific , as is the value .
The manager then told us we could order from whatever menu we wanted but by that time we were so annoyed with the waiter and the resturant that we let and went some place else .
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty ( could 've used a bit more salt ) .
I WAS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED BY THE FOOD .
This is a great place to take out-of-towners , and perfect for watching the sunset .
I have tried the various slice joints around the village but this is by far the best one .
This is the only Thai place I go too in NYC , it 's wonderful , and live relaxed Jazz on certain nights .
Chinese Desserts are known for healthful benefits in addition to the sweetness .
I 'm partial to the Gnocchi .
Not a typical pizza joint , but good for a low key and fairly cheap nice sit down dinner .
We recently decided to try this location , and to our delight , they have outdoor seating , perfect since I had my yorkie with me .
We were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd .
I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki and my husband got Garlic Shrimp .
The place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening .
We asked for beverages and never received them .
The cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee !!
For desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse ( interesting but not extraordinary ) and matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal .
In fact , it appears he is going to go postal at any moment .
Chennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city .
Definitely will be back !
Please try the Filet Mignon , its just the most tender piece ever .
The restaurant could use a little paint , but all in all a great sushi place !
Do n't waste money on decor .
This was a great surprise .
I ca n't remember the last time I had such gross food in New York .
Very cozy and warm inside .....
I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive .
go here for the drinks !
I 'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service .
It 's really a takeaway place , I would n't sit if I could take it home .
Not worth it .
I went to Del Frisco 's Friday night with my boyfriend for an 8:00 reservation .
They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another .
The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I 've had at this price range .
The best dessert , a chocolate and peanut butter tart , is n't particularly Hawaiian , but it 's a small world when it comes to sweets .
The drinks are great , especially when made by Raymond .
Either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th .
Butter was melted , white wine warm , cheese oozing everywhere .
Excellent experience .
They 're also friendlier here , especially the owner , Kenny .
I ordered tamarind duck and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef , and we were both delighted by the way the dishes evoked Thai flavors in unexpected ways .
The characters really make for an enjoyable experience .
I highly recommend it .
All the NYU students love this place so it makes for a fun young atmosphere .
One of my favorites though was the Angry Lobster , a cold lobster salad that was magnificent .
Went to Village last night for my birthday .
I found the variety of the sashimi plate to be satisfying - fresh and yummy .
I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date .
Each bite of food at Kai was indeed delicious , fresh , and elegant .
The service was dreadfully slow ( the place was only half full ) and a smile would have been nice ...
The food was outstanding and the service was tops .
Highly recommend this as great value for excellent sushi and service .
I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date .
Great food , great drinks , nice dining atmosphere .
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included : ceviche mix ( special ) , crab dumplings , assorted sashimi , sushi and rolls , two types of sake , and the banana tempura .
We only ordered desserts and drinks , but no refills were offered .
Noodle pudding is exactly the type of service and food I enjoy .
We will be back .
The food was definitely good , but when all was said and done , I just could n't justify it for the price ( including 2 drinks , $ 100/person ) ...
It 's like they took leftover chicken , poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it ( the sauce was translucent and red ) .
It also has lots of other Korean dishes that are affordable and just as yummy .
We were fans of the half-price Saturday night option until some inedible squid during a recent visit .
the mushroom barley soup is amazing .
I came to fresh expecting a great meal , and all I got was marginally so-so food served in a restaurant that was just so freezing we could n't enjoy eating .
THR AT MOSHPHERE IS COMPACT , MODERN , YET COZY .
The atmosphere is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon .
My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge !
i actually feel like i should keep it a secret .
This place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area .
The food was terrific and the service classy , attentive , without being overbearing .
After being told that our party of three would be seated in 10 minutes and watching other parties ( multiples of 2 and higher ) seated for 40 minutes , the three of us were squished into a small 2-person table .
Ahhh ...
Also , do n't plan on asking for your favorite roll , if it 's not on the menu , you ca n't have it .
First of all Dal Bukhara Rocks .
We know the difference between and oyster and bad fish .
they were dry and disgusting , i did n't even finish my first piece .
This place has good potential , but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else .
Waitstaff is great , very attentive .
We visit at least once a month .
this one is definintely my least favorite .
Great pizza for lunch place .
delicious bagels , especially when right out of the oven .
Quick and friendly service .
If you 're in the ' hood , definitely stop in .
Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff .
The homage to India is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer , a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce , while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated , fresh take on sweet-and-sour .
Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza ( as I love La Pizza Fresca ) .
but when we looked at the menu , there were n't a lot of choices , most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section .
It wo n't break the bank but I also wouldnt come back for the food .
Thius is a must for anyone who loves Shabu-Shabu .
Oh yes , and if you are a fan of Indian oldies film stars , there are plenty of portraits of Indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls , some of which , I would love to know where they obtained .
Although the place could be a little more eye catching and roomier , at the same time , it does n't really matter .
But they 've done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials like the Godmother pizza ( a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil-brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual ) .
Still , try it once , since if you end up loving the food , it could be one of your best dining experiences .
The parathas and kebabs are made when ordered ensuring a level of freshness that is unsurpassed .
I have been here a few times for dinner , once for brunch and twice for lunch .
Faan 's got a great concept but a little rough on the delivery .
What more can you ask for ?
It 's best to go on a cold night with a close friend or a good book .
What makes this restaurant special are the authentic sichuan cooking and being the only one in NYC that offers authentic chongqing hotpot .
Found service above average , but that could be because we were 13 of us .
The sushi is amazing !!!
We loved it and will go back !
I ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor .
When I arrived at Orsay I was thrown back , in a veyr good sense .
It appears to be the owner 's first venture and it shows .
new hamburger with special sauce is ok - at least better than big mac !
WE ENDED UP IN LITTLE ITALY IN LATE AFTERNOON .
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service .
INCREDIBLY POOR SERVICE AN FOOD QUALITY AT EXORBITANT PRICES .
They charge $ 6.00 for rice .
Not enough wines by the glass either .
My husband and I have been sold on this from the first visit .
All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent , but the gyro is the reason to come -- if you do n't eat one your trip was wasted .
The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic .
I like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing .
Still , any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house ...
I got the $ 10 10-piece dim sum combo , every bite of which was great .
While it was large and a bit noisy , the drinks were fantastic , and the food was superb .
Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best , freshly baked bread !
They honored reservation on Sunday afternoon very well .
Great food , good size menu , great service and an unpretensious setting .
Nothing better than buying a snapple for $ 3.25 too .
To be honest we only ever eat the Shabu Shabu .
The people with carts of food do n't understand you because they do n't speak English , their job is to give you the delicious food you point at .
After hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant , and passing by it on a daily basis , we decided to try .
Service was good and so was the atmosphere .
Had dinner here on a Friday and the food was great .
An excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but , the food was slightly disappointing .
I 'd definitely go back again .
THIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED .
My friends and I showed up on a Sat .
amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages PLEASE do yourself a favor and check this place out !!!!
The beverages were excellent , and the dessert was good .
I was turned on to this restaurant by a fellow foodie friend of mine , and have been going back regularly ever since .
Skip this location and go to the one in Soho .
The puke green walls leave a lot to be desired , but the food is very good .
Not sure where the previous reviewer , lonk , dined , but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food !
uni from maine vs california , sea vs freshwater eel ) to get a good taste comparison .
Ive been here a bunch of times now and the service is always outstanding .
Not the greatest sushi place , but excellent for a $ 19.95 all you can eat .
so i thought why not change it up a bit .
Offerings like hot cakes and the Egg McMuffin sandwich are available for breakfast .
For a savory take on the soup and sandwich meal , try the hot and sour soup .
We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday , and I was thoroughly impressed with the food .
I loved it .
Way below average
This place is to be avoided .
I would like to return and try some of the other menu items when I do n't have to rush off to a show .
The atmosphere was great .
Went here on sat 1/26 and was disappointed .
Price no more than a Jersey deli but way better .
Great food , great prices , great service .
Have frequented ' ino for several years and the food remains excellent .
This is my favorite Italian restaurant in all of New York City .
What a great place !
Yakitori ( bbq meats ) is tasty too .
The atmosphere is attractive , but a little uncomfortable .
The location is perfect .
The wait staff is very courteous and accomodating .
Our server was very helpful and friendly .
Do n't miss Bloom 's on your next trip to Manhatten .
Open late ( well as late as I ever got there and I 'm a night person )
Stay with the roasted chickens and you 'll be fine .
There is no excuse for such lousy service !
Everything is excellent , the menu is quite extensive , and you eat with a view on both sides of the city .
I have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a mushroom consomme - and this chef accomplishes without fats .
If the weather is nice , try to snag an outside table .
After we ate our appetizers ( which took all of 8 minutes ) we ordered another round of Brahma 's - and tried to stall a little as we waited for our sixth dinner member .
I 've come here for casual lunches as well as for a friend 's birthday and I always enjoy myself .
OK , I 've been to Dumont a few times now .
We had our Christmas party at Dos Caminos and it was wonderful .
This place must have cost the owners afortune to build .
The food here does a great service to the name ( Cantonese that is ... ) .
A real dissapointment .
There is a downside if you 're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude .
All are GREAT - poori , naan , paratha all FRESH .
Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll .
I went to Ruby Foos for my birthday and enjoyed our experience there .
I have been to Rao 's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better .
Got club soda , filled with ice , no lime .
Orsay , is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic French food in NYC .
Pastrami or corned beef are juicy and piled high ( ask for extra rye bread ) .
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny .
My first encounter happened one friday evening with a friend .
No desert menu , no apology , nothing !!!!!!
We have lived in Chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant .
I will be returning .
Prices are in line .
My friends and I have been going here regularly for two years .
Plus , on Wednesday nights the house wine is unlimited !
The dish had like 6 pieces of beef in it .
The view is spectacular , and the food is great .
It 's just good food , nothing more and that 's all we want !
It is thick and slightly soggy .
Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes .
This was n't the expected menu comprised only of pad thai and tom yum soup , but I thought that was what made the place so special .
I wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly , curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it .
I 'll keep this short .
Host and Hostess was quite rude .
Great Indian food and the service is incredible .
Once we finally got a table , despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed !
The place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious .
This bar has it all - great drinks , cool atmosphere , excellent service and delicious food .
Personally I like the margherita pizza better , but they are all good .
If you venture off the island of Manhattan and ca n't seem to find a great Italian restaurant , drive to Corona .
The atmosphere is nothing special , but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo .
Would definitely visit again .
I 've been coming here regularly since it opened , about 2 years ago .
Sauce was watery and the food did n't have much flavor .
We 've lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had dinner there .
IT WAS OUR ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT AND WANTED AN AUTHENTIC ITALIAN MEAL .
Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza .
Eating at Ottimo is like eating in Chef Salvatore Esposito 's home .
Servers are all different , Greg is my favorite .
Desserts include flan and sopaipillas .
What a ripoff !
Alias is warm and cozy and you do n't get that squished-in feeling you get at 71 Clinton .
And when I visit her I make it a point to eat at ' Ino at least once daily if not once for the whole trip .
The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful .
I liked the beer selection !
Hats off to the chef .
Ive been to many Thai restaurants in Manhattan before , and Toons is by far the best Thai food Ive had ( except for my mom 's of course ) .
I would n't even have complained at all if the food at least tasted good but the quality of food was crappy , too .
I 've been to Sotto Voce several time , and I have to say this one place that hits the nail right on the head ever time !
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice .
I 'm from England , and Haru 's was the best I had in NYC .
What came to our table was burned beyond recognition and stringy .
Good , because hey , it 's more food , but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap .
Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you .
i would just ask for no oil next time .
i recommend the thai popcorn : )
The food was great and tasty , but the sitting space was too small , I do n't like being cramp in a corner .
The menu is Prix Fixe , so be prepared to spend at least $ 60 per person , but it is Well worth itsuperb food .
Its located in greenewich village .
My husband and I enjoy Sangria .
I stumbled upon this resteraunt on my way home from the subway .
The food is all shared so we get to order together and eat together .
It is very overpriced and not very tasty .
Service was also very good .
The food is flavorful , plentiful and reasonably priced .
The service was the only thing good about this restaurant .
I have to say the place was awesome .
Only complaint is the pricing -- I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .
I have been going there since it opened and I ca n't get enough .
The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty .
Although somewhat loud , the noise was minimally intrusive .
mojitos and the service are the best part in there
Until you realize that their five minutes is meaningless and your wait may be anywhere from two to twenty minutes it may be frustrating .
Service was very good - prompt , attentive and non-intrusive .
I LOVE their spicy scallop roll , and my boyfriend consistently gets the sesame chicken .
I really liked the noodle dishes at Rice Avenue compared to their Green Curry dish .
He takes real pride in his food and his business .
they did n't disappoint , service from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table .
It was wonderful .
Our first time in New York and we had to try a New York Bagel .
You would think they would make up for it with service , sadly , no .
Will comeback for sure , wish they have it here in LA . .
It 's a shame that a nice , convenient place like the Pink Pony can be so ruined by lousy service .
I ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime .
Planet Thai is great !
We also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka .
My husband and I have been there at least 6 times and we 've always been given the highest service and often free desserts .
We were worried we would have trouble getting in , but somehow managed to have a short wait .
Guess what , I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , " oh well , I wish you would have said something earlier " No apology , nothing .
I 've been many time and have never been disappointed .
Come on .
You can even get packages of the chutneys to stock your fridge !
Never got an explanation as to what was going on .
I thought the food is n't cheap at all compared to Chinatown .
I 've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years : A new Jazz Bar , the most fantastic Dining Garden , the Best Thin Crust Pizzas , and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for ( these are not your average lasagnas ) !
It 's nice to find a place that is open 24 hours ( especially in downtown Brooklyn ) .
There was a small wait , but shorter than I expected .
This place is a great bargain .
Get the tuna of gari .
Obv caviar is top of the line but the rest of the menu is so diverse it gives you a chance to taste so manydifferent varietys .
The hot and sour soup was unbearably hot and tasted of only pepper and nothing else .
It is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY -- I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country .
We love the food , drinks , and atmosphere !
It saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy , crowded bar at dinnertime .
Love YUKA .
and you ca n't beat the prices .
Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service , which was boarderline rude .
Bay Terrace mall is nothing ( ok , almost nothing ) without it !
The food was very well prepared .
The folding chair I was seated at was uncomfortable .
Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza .
Just moved to the neighborhood and we 've been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants .
I know because I live nearby .
Not only was the waiter efficient and courteous , but also extremely helpful .
Service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded .
I went there with my friend last saturday .
The service was attentive .
Everything is always cooked to perfection , the service is excellent , the decor cool and understated .
The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate .
The floor was wet , the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor , no soap , and no hand towels left .
I only tried a simple dish of spinach ravioli in a light oil and garlic sauce , but it actually faired better than most NYC Italian joints I 've tried similar dishes at .
I was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter .
I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart 's for their food , the ambience and wonderful service .
We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh .
After reading the great reviews , I invited a die-hard downtown friend of mine to join me at TASTE .
The absolute worst service I 've ever experienced and the food was below average ( when they actually gave people the meals they ordered ) .
I 'm just reading some of these reviews and its nonsense that people are reviewing some places because it was too loud .
Overall , I 'm still impressed that the place even exists and the prices are quite decent but then again , its Chinatown .
I suspect this restaurant is what Rao 's would be if it had n't turned exclusive .
But the thai is definitely not great -- bland and indistinguished .
I came across Village Underground by accident , now I go there all the time .
I definitely would n't go back .
Over price , and small portions .
Stick to dimsum , not super overpriced noodles .
The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions .
Do n't leave without trying One Night in Tokyo .
My girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .
but , the filet mignon was not very good at all cocktail hour includes free appetizers ( nice non-sushi selection ) .
The signs , the specials menus , food , and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese .
Food is always fresh and hot - ready to eat !
The bar has various selections and the mixed drink special is a catcher ! 2 for 1 's .
The menu , which changes seasonally , shows both regional and international influences .
I discovered Applebees when I went away to college in VA .
I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service .
Innovations are just as assured , from the simple Carinthia cheese ravioli with wild mushrooms to the caviar-topped sturgeon , beautifully matched with a bright green spinach-vodka sauce .
Overall , excellent restaurant !
My mouth starts to water merely thinking about the delight that is this restaurant .
We laughed when he finally offered us a dessert menu and we left a 10 percent tip , which was generous , I feel .
I thought I had died and gone to heaven .
Great Indian food and the service is incredible .
I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price ( just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $ 25 ) , which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place does n't have an upscale feel .
Our friends have not arrived yet .
It was delicious and large !
Perfectly al dente pasta , not drowned in sauce -- generous portions .
The veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly .
Maybe it was just an unintentional mistake but I 've experienced the same with other restaurants so I do n't appreciate such practice .
Anyways , if you 're in the neighborhood to eat good food , I would n't waste my time trying to find something , rather go across the street to Tamari .
This place is not worth the prices .
Seriously , this is the best all you can eat in town - As everyone says , the Spicy Tuna hand rolls are the best - have 4 of these , and you 've broken even .
for Meetball Night .
Who said go when the place is quiet during the day ?
Not someplace I would seek to try out but if I am in the area again , I will certainly stop by .
To celebrate a birthday , three of us went to Mare anticipating great food .
I love this cozy around the way Rest .
I really liked this place .
All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends !
the restaurant was completely empty , but she gave me a dirty look and asked , no reservations ?
Our waitress was n't mean , but not especially warm or attentive either .
Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything .
Well , it happened because of a graceless manager and a rude bartender who had us waiting 20 minutes for drinks , and then tells us to chill out .
This place does n't compare with Mamoun 's in terms of price , freshness , value , and consisent quality , but that 's just my opinion .
Suan was a recommendation that I am glad we heeded .
Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the thai food is excellent too .
and for this i had to shell out a small fortune ?
Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you 're with .
All of it was simply amazing , unique and tasty and best of all it did n't break the bank .
My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it .
The food is above average for midtown and sligtly better than some of the other Heartland Breweries in the city .
Love Pizza 33 . .
The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless , so was the seafood tagliatelle .
I did n't complain , I liked the atmosphere so much .
When the main course finally arrived ( another 45mins ) half of our order was missing .
The staff members are extremely friendly and even replaced my drink once when I dropped it outside .
I had a great experience .
For the location , the prices are very reasonable .
Get the pepperoni - YUM - and a family style salad .
I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND .
On our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table .
They used shredded cheese on top !
The design and atmosphere is just as good .
My entire family was horrified .
I love this place more and more everytime i go .
I have to agree with the previous reviewer .
We were pleasantly surprised .
they live up to the thai way of living .
After my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer .
but overall i give it a 10
The waitress was not attentive at all .
There 's nice and quiet , small but enough for 6 ( or more ) .
I 'm a friendly person , so I would n't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal .
People are always friendly .
The food was amazing , and the service was prompt and helpful , but not over-bearing or rushed .
Should you happen to be impressed by the cuisine definitely try it .
It is the best hidden spot there and I rave about it to everyone .
I can say that the wraps , burgers and salads were all fresh , tasty and the mango margareta at $ 9 was WELL WORTH the money .
The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual .
Decor is nice though service can be spotty .
She lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy .
I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE .
Another great thing about Glechik-everything is very cheap !
Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant .
Ummm ... the beer was cold .
I knew upon visiting NYC that I wanted to try an orginal deli .
Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon , which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave.
If the weather is nice , try to snag an outside table .
I 've lived in NYC all my life and had never before seen so many waterbugs in one place ( except in a really bad dream ) .
By far this is the only chinese desserts place I know in NY or anywhere close in the Northeastern America that serves desserts with frog jelly in a couple of varieties and pig feet ginger simmered in black vinegar .
It could have been handled better .
