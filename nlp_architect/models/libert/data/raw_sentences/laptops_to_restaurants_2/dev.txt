Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll .
I/we will never go back to this place again .
My wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food .
That is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish , and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste .
Unfortunately , the food is outstanding , but everything else about this restaurant is the pits .
Definite go if you 're used to good Indian restaurant food from abroad .
Try the spicy wontons and the salt pepper shrimps .
We were in search of food and stumbled on this block of Indian restaurants on East Sixth Street .
Decor is charming .
I found the food , service and value exceptional everytime I have been there .
We actually left hungry and went across the street to Wo Hop at 15 Mott street for some good chinese food .
If you 're into being lost when you 're just five feet from your table then hey , that 's a good thing .
Get the tuna of gari .
LOL
The crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components .
the food was undercooked-the sauce watery , and the vegetables raw .
In reality ( to maximize potential diners ) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby .
Beware of the chili signed food items not unless you want to call the fire department to douse the flames in your mouth .
Harumi Sushi has the freshest and most delicious array of sushi in NYC .
The tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent .
The neighborhood was nice though so check out another restaurant instead .
It 's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone .
I 'm going back .
Very affordable and excellent ambient !
Ambience is so cute and quaint , good for business although we were there on vacation .
supercilious scorn is in .
The location is perfect .
Good for a quick sushi lunch .
Consequently , their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did ' nt feel like finishing them .
Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you .
The stuff tilapia was horrid ... tasted like cardboard .
Fantastic place .
Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order .
It was like the servers forgot that they actually worked there and instead wanted to hang out and be cool .
I love this cozy around the way Rest .
The service is excellent , the decor is great , and the food is delicious and comes in large portions .
I am French and I really felt like home !!!
After dinner I heard music playing and discovered that there is a lounge downstairs .
Great food , great waitstaff , great atmosphere , and best of all GREAT beer !
awesome
We were so happy with our food and were even more thrilled when we saw the bill .
The jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes .
The Seafood Dynamite is also otherworldly .
The prices were fantastic .
Ess-A-Bagel ( either by Sty-town or midtown ) is by far the best bagel in NY .
Just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday .
The food we ordered was excellent , although I would n't say the margaritas were anything to write home about .
What can you say about a place where the waitress brings out the wrong entree , then verbally assaults your 80 year old grandmother and gives her lip about sending it back ( which she did politely , by the way ) .
Ca n't wait wait for my next visit .
Their twist on pizza is heatlhy , but full of flavor .
Not impressed with the food .
I 've been coming here on and off for the past five years and I have to say that La Lanterna has never , ever dissapointed me .
We were pleasantly surprised .
the turkey burgers are scary !
I care more about the food and ambience .
Great neighborhood joint .
When we inquired about ports - the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost .
The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees .
GO HERE .
I am going to the mid town location next .
I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken .
Will comeback for sure , wish they have it here in LA . .
Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service , which was boarderline rude .
Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town !
We asked to be moved ( which took half an hour ) , and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back , even though the rest of the room was practically empty .
Did I mention the wine ?
On the other hand , if you are not fooled easily , you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse , and food that will outshine in presentaion , taste , choice , quality and quantity .
The food is good .
What came to our table was burned beyond recognition and stringy .
If you 're craving for Haru 's great food , especially the House Roll , but ca n't stand the wait building outisde , head across the street to their Sake Bar !
The food was boring and expensive .
We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful .
Should you happen to be impressed by the cuisine definitely try it .
They are often crowded on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their service .
I 'm going back .
I 'll keep this short .
During our trip to NYC , we made reservations to dine in the pool room of the Four Seasons for their pre-theater menu ( offering a modified menu for $ 65 pp ) .
My friends and I stop here for pizza before hitting the Kips Bay movie theater .
What more can you ask for ?
The dish had like 6 pieces of beef in it .
Two complaints - their appetizer selection stinks , it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu .
In addition to great hot dogs , DOTP has wonderful breakfast sandwiches that feature , in addition to great things like tator tots and English muffins , a delicious NJ-based pork product know to us Jersey girls and boys as Taylor ham .
I am not a vegetarian but , almost all the dishes were great .
Authentic food and they have REAL service , not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door .
This place has totally weird decor , stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional ...
I heartily recommend .
Everyone was more then happy with his choices .
Satisfying .
I wish they would change back to what it was before .
We ended the dinner with a surprisingly light and flaky apple tarte tatin .
An excellent service
I 've made the trip out here a few times with a friend who lives nearby ( I live on UWS ) .
Ballato 's is consistently delicious authentic italian food .
Another great place to take out-of-towners !
An oasis of refinement : Food , though somewhat uneven , often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef 's passion ( and kitchen 's precise execution ) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups .
I 'm glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in NY .
The chicken pot pie is excpetiona , the cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm .
People are always friendly .
Even though it is a little loud , you do n't have to yell at each other to talk .
Delicate spices , onions , eggs and a kick-ass roti .
Always busy but fast moving .
Where tanks in other Chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters , the tanks at Ping 's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover 's brunch .
Good creative rolls !
The food was mediocre and the service was severely slow .
The folding chair I was seated at was uncomfortable .
The halibut cheek appetizer came with a generous portion of foie gras , but that 's about the only positive thing I can say about the meal .
The dinner menu is diverse and top-notch as well .
After the main course came , we did n't see our waiter for at least 40 MINUTES !
I had a late dinner at Lucky Stike , a great name for a joint if ever I saw one .
Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you .
I have never eaten in the restaurant , however , upon reading the reviews I got take out last week .
The lack of AC and the fact that there are a million swarming bodies ( although everyone is polite and no one is pushing ) is a slight turn off .
I was n't impressed and it was n't SPICEY ????
The food is all shared so we get to order together and eat together .
To be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora .
We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town .
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience .
I 've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences .
people are rude bit again it 's new york !
You ca n't say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown .
we were seated at the sushi bar in front of yasuda .
We 'd go back again
The hot dogs were cold in the middle and the buns were stale .
Its dark , and cozy . . there is always jazz music playing when we go .
The food was not very tasty , the portioins were tiny even for such a high quality restaurant .
It 's only $ 1.95 for a regular slice and $ 4.00 for a slice with a mushroom , not mushrooms .
On a recent Sunday afternoon , a friend and I accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT .
The rice to fish ration was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice .
If you do n't mind pre-sliced low quality fish , unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place .
It was divine melts in your mouth .
Our server checked on us maybe twice during the entire meal .
Creamy appetizers -- taramasalata , eggplant salad , and Greek yogurt ( with cuccumber , dill , and garlic ) taste excellent when on warm pitas .
They tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter , so i 'm looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it .
I love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants makes the food fine cuisine , even with no idea how to use them .
Just ignore the trendy wannabes .
By far this is the only chinese desserts place I know in NY or anywhere close in the Northeastern America that serves desserts with frog jelly in a couple of varieties and pig feet ginger simmered in black vinegar .
A large is $ 20 , and toppings are about $ 3 each .
The lobster sandwich is $ 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price .
MMmmm ... it was delicious .
I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll .
Yum , the chicken is great here .
The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts .
Oh , but wait , we were out of drinks ( which were also delightfully overpriced ) .
I can not imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant .
The pizza was great .
This restaurant is such a great place .
A beautiful atmosphere , perfect for drinks and/or appetizers .
The food was pretty good , but a little flavorless and the portions very small , including dessert .
I lOVE THIS PLACE !
The food was outstanding and the service was tops .
Finally !
I have been to Rao 's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better .
And it all comes at a very reasonable price ( congee , noodles , and rice dishes are no more than $ 3-6 each ) .
Their sake list was extensive , but we were looking for Purple Haze , which was n't listed but made for us upon request !
I can not imagine better Indian food in all of the city .
Not the greatest sushi place , but excellent for a $ 19.95 all you can eat .
On our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table .
Compared to other shabu restaurants around town , this places wins hands-down .
For $ 760 for 2 people , it 's a once in a lifetime experience .
The food was extremely tasty , creatively presented and the wine excellent .
The decor is designed in a contemporary Japanese style restaurant .
The service is not consistently excellent -- just decent .
My boyfriend asked me if I wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead , while he de-skinned the chicken so that I could enjoy the white meat .
Save room for the desserts ! ; - )
Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best , freshly baked bread !
You can get an excellent meal at most of the many Indian restaurants on nearby Lexington Avenue for the cost of one the dainty dishes here .
Would definitely visit again .
Just make sure my ice water is kept full and my tea kettle filled with piping hot tea and that 's all the service I need ...
This place is so much fun .
I was so sad to read the bad reviews this place got !
However , I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once .
Not only do they have the best escargot in town , they always try to accomodate our toddler .
I wish I could like this place more , and I wish someone would retrain the staff .
Will never be back .
The owners and employees are friendly and their pizza is fantastic .
The space is traditional in feel .
Restaurants in manhattan should try to model food and service after this place .
Excellent atmosphere , delicious dishes good and friendly service .
THE LASAGNA WAS PROBABLY THE BEST I HAVE TASTED .
cirspy crust margherita pizza
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us .
Good , fast service .
I must give it Yon out of Yon stars !
Highly recommend this as great value for excellent sushi and service .
Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available .
A real dissapointment .
I 've been many time and have never been disappointed .
The food here was mediocre at best .
Definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date .
I wish they would change back to what it was before .
Molto bene !
We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there , sharing a large Pelligrino , a pizza of two of their specials , one was goat cheese the other blue cheese , and both were excellent .
Here 's the thing , you 're in the best city in the world for restaurants .
We will go back every time we are in the City .
It is quite a spectacular scene i 'll give them that .
Not a large place , but it 's cute and cozy .
I was literally going to explode , but instead , my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager .
I 'll keep this short .
Also , top the meal with a delicious and perfect slice of tiramisu .
Service here was great , food was fantastic .
Stepping into Casa La Femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in New York !
Great romantic place for a date ( try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close ! ) .
By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka !
The portion sizes here are huge , and the sushi is good .
Bagels are ok , but be sure not to make any special requests !
Terrible , terrible management - deserves to be shut-down .
Be sure to accompany your food with one of their fresh juice concoctions .
Have the iced tea .
We concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake , both were delicious .
This is the perfect date spot for Williamsburg couples .
We had a wonderful meal at Naples 45 a month ago on a visit to NYC .
Very affordable and excellent ambient !
Take a good sense of humor , an American express card with no limit , walk out with a lollipop , gift bag in hand and enough marketing materials for alain to to take the show on the road
Really .
Simple healthy unglamorous food cheap .
On the recommendation of a friend , I checked out Arezzo with my wife .
Try the cheesecake !
The Yellowtail was particularly good as well .
She gets 10 for her excellent service and advice .
All of it was simply amazing , unique and tasty and best of all it did n't break the bank .
LOVE the atmosphere - felt like I was in Paris .
Really though , where 's the seasoning ?
This is literally a hot spot when it comes to the food .
Having been a long time Ess-a-Bagel fan , I was surpised to find myself return time and time again to Murray 's .
After really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner .
We visited Bread Bar during January restaurant week and were so pleased with the menu selections and service .
I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE .
Excellent experience .
THe back garden sitting area is very pleasant , where you can see their personal herb garden .
The place does get crowded , so I recommend going between 4-5 PM .
The lunch special is an asbolute steal .
Only drawback - they wo n't toast your bagel , and they do n't make eggs for the bagel .
The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared .
Go there on an empty stomach and leave feeling like a baby Veal Calf ( ok bad joke ) , but you will see .
Had a great experience at Trio ... staff was pleasant ; food was tasty and large in portion size - I would highly recommend the portobello/gorgonzola/sausage appetizer and the lobster risotto .
This is a great place to take out-of-towners , and perfect for watching the sunset .
There is a real gallery of stars that have visited .
The food itself was just ok - nothing spectacular - but the service was awful .
Also , because it is so thin , it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling .
I can understand the prices if it served better food , like some Chinese restaurants in midtown/uptown area .
This is as good as neighborhood restaurants come .
The wait staff is very freindly , they make it feel like you 're eating in a freindly little european town .
I would go back tho .
Whether your choose the iced blended mocha or the hot white mocha you are sure to be extremely happy .
I had the black cod with yuzu sauce , which was wonderful .
How can hope to stay in business with service like this ?
Overall I would recommend it and go back again .
Of course , it is crowded but who cares .
It 's just O.K. pizza .
I really recommend the very simple Unda ( Egg ) rolls .
We ordered a glass of wine and were finished eating and paying before the wine came .
This is a great Thai restaurant with a very friendly staff .
How do you rate home ?
She then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables .
Made my dining experience uncomfortable .
Too cold to enjoy .
we came here on a crowded saturday night and were seated right away despite being 15 minutes late for our reservation .
Not a great place for family or general dining .
Kind , attentive wait staff .
Also very inexpensive .
The bruscetta is a bit soggy , but the salads were fresh , included a nice mix of greens ( not iceberg ) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen .
When we arrived at 6:00 PM , the restaurant was practically empty .
Always good drinks and service is pretty good ;
All the desserts the group tried got favorable reviews .
Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed , however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance .
The food is authentic Italian - delicious !
I 've lived in NY for 5 years and this place has it all .
so delicious !!!!!!
They were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior .
When we sat , we got great and fast service .
Only suggestion is that you skip the dessert , it was overpriced and fell short on taste .
They make the best pizza in New Jersey .
We recently decided to try this location , and to our delight , they have outdoor seating , perfect since I had my yorkie with me .
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience .
I did n't expect to like Nosh as much as I did , but the pastrami on challah sandwich I had was otherworldly , the soups are like Mom 's , and the knishes give Yonah Schimmel 's a run for its money .
The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .
Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn .
Everything at Sala Thai is tasty and well-portioned .
I do not recommend .
For two people with tip was less than $ 25 bucks .
It 's best to go on a cold night with a close friend or a good book .
Do n't miss Bloom 's on your next trip to Manhatten .
I 've been eating at Taj Mahal for over twenty years and have found them to be the most excellent of the Indian eateries on this block of Indian restaurants .
They have a very good chicken with avocado and good tuna as well .
This was , from start to finish , a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience .
The food is reliable and the price is moderate .
When we were finally seated our waitress came by twice-1 for our order and 2-for our check .
Rao 's has the best service and atmosphere in NYC .
Its an excellent place to relax and the food is one of the best in the city of New York .
Despite the 5th ave address there are no frills whick I also love .
My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it .
I 've been coming here as a child and always come back for the taste .
Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner .
From beginning appetizers , the scallops were incredible , to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sorbet , we were delighted by the taste sensations .
The steak melted in my mouth .
We were fans of the half-price Saturday night option until some inedible squid during a recent visit .
The kitchen however , is almost always slow .
Their wines by the glass are a great accompaniment and you can eat like a king with wine for under $ 30 .
It is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late , raucus dinner .
I 've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences .
The waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet , we were told no ...
I always get the Shabu-Shabu dinner and the beef is always fresh .
The eggplant parmesan is also great , and my friend who grew up in Manhattan claims that no one serves a better baked ziti with meatsauce .
Rather than preparing vegetarian dish , the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables ( minus sauce , seasoning , or any form or aesthetic presentation ) .
I was starving and the small portions were driving me crazy !
Great food , great prices , great service .
This restaurant was way overhyped .
Furthermore , the rice had no seasoning , so the sushi was bland and disgusting .
The service is fantastic .
We will definitely go back .
its just a fun place to go , not a five star restaraunt .
We were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd .
I 'm saving up for my next visit .
If you love seafood , you would love this place !
The food was spicy and delicious .
We had great desserts ( including the best cannoli I 've ever had ) and then they offered an after dinner drink , on the house .
Just go to Yamato and order the Red Dragon Roll .
The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had ( I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat ) .
The staff is unbelievably friendly , and I dream about their Saag gosht ... so good .
I had the best ravioli ever .
The first time I went , and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere , I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad .
And these are not small , wimpy fast food type burgers - these are real , full sized patties .
The waiters and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but were n't as dismayed or apologetic as I would have expected .
The food is uniformly exceptional , with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating , whether it 's on the menu or not .
Never got an explanation as to what was going on .
A little noise but I think that was because of our party !
This is my favorite Italian restaurant in all of New York City .
The signs , the specials menus , food , and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese .
The Sashimi portion are big enough to appease most people , but I did n't like the fact they used artifical lobster meat .
Very popular style Izakaya ( Sake and small portion of sake-friendly dishes ) .
My wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food .
The first time the sushi was outstanding , the second time it was a little bland .
While certain staples are excellent ( the burger , some of the pastas ) , the food is not really the point .
Try green curry with vegetables .
sometimes i get bad food and bad service , sometimes i get good good and bad service .
The service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served .
It does n't look appetizing as it 's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black , but the taste was phenomenal .
My mouth starts to water merely thinking about the delight that is this restaurant .
( and I have eaten my share ) Which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to serve .
Salads were fantastic .
Unique apppetizers .
That place was awesome , , , sally !
You wo n't be dissapointed .
I HATE HATE HATE this place .
I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks !
I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read .
This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie ( that do n’t serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city !
We 've found it to be better and fresher than Kiku which is comparable in price .
Highly Highly Highly recommended !
I would highly recommend .
Drinks got screwed up , she acted put upon .
However , I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once .
I have n't been to the other locations .
For an untrendy rip-off - eat here .
I 've been many time and have never been disappointed .
Raga 's is a romantic , cozy restaurant .
If you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave.
At peak times , the restaurant is overcrowded and tables are uncomfortably close .
Chance is a joke .
I will not be coming here at 3am again .
MY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended ... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly !
The food was just OK , at least for what food was available .
The food is great ( big selection , reasonable prices ) and the drinks are really good .
highly recommended .
The homage to India is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer , a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce , while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated , fresh take on sweet-and-sour .
Taking Hot Dogs to the next level
Was there Friday night .
I went there 2times .
Lahore is a great place to duck into late-night when you need some really tasty food on the cheap -- you 'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for FOUR DOLLARS .
Hurley 's is like Cheers where everyone knows your name and they are ACTUALLY glad you came .
Great friendly service , Fast seating , Fast Delivery , Excellent sushi .
They forgot a sandwich , did n't include plastic forks , and did n't include pita with the hummus platter .
The food is top notch , the service is attentive , and the atmosphere is great .
Wonderful menu , warm inviting ambiance , great service the FOOD keeps me coming back !
By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant .
The decor is nice , but more casual than fine dining .
The pickles were great addition .
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere .
Unfortunately , we chose this spot for lunch as we had done a lot of walking and ended up at the South St Seaport .
The food is great and reasonably priced .
We were n't !
Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS !
We will go back every time we are in the City .
Skip this restaurant , it 's a big disappointment .
While the prices are nothing special , the portions are huge .
I 'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service .
word of advice , save room for pasta dishes and never leave until you 've had the tiramisu .
Everything I had was good , and I 'm a eater .
This is a fun restaurant to go to .
Also , specify if you like your food spicy - its rather bland if you do n't .
The staff was accomodating , the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely .
since i was in the neighborhood , we made sure to give this a try .
I was back-to-back with the diner at the table behind me and wait staff had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again .
( food was delivered by a busboy , not waiter ) We got no cheese offered for the pasta , our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal , when we would have easily spent another $ 20 on wine .
The service was attentive .
I also ordered for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the order .
My husband and I take out from here 3-4 times a month .
The service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing .
Just stick with the small dishes !
Do n't expect to sit down inside though , there are only a few tables and they are always full .
I went with my fiance on a Tuesday evening .
From the moment you walk in , you feel like you 're in the perfect place .
great toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost !
It is definitely a good spot for snacks and chat .
The sicilian is my favorite it is moist not dry like most places but all their pizza is great !
We 'll definitly be back again !
We had fun eating in there , we were there like around 3 a.m. in the morning !
The fries are yummy .
The makhani was OK -- the korma was bland .
The sake menu should not be overlooked !
The food is good , the teriyaki I recommend .
This is the pinnacle of Indian Fast Food ( all fast foods in my opinion ) .
While the ambiance and atmosphere were great , the food and service could have been a lot better .
While this is a pretty place in that overly cute French way , the food was insultingly horrible .
You will find everything about Trio to your liking !
Everyone is welcomed in as family .
Molto bene !
I 've had to wait only a few times during lunch but this place is definitely worth the wait .
We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night .
Over all it was a very nice romantic place .
But regulars know that the sandwiches are the real star here .
My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .
Thius is a must for anyone who loves Shabu-Shabu .
In about 12 minutes , the thing is gone .
Not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring .
The service is always great , and the owner walks around to make sure you enjoy .
They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends .
I absolutely Loved this place .
still stay away , the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were serves eventhough they were there much longer ...
I stopped by for some brunch today and had the vegan cranberry pancakes and some rice milk .
it 's delicious !
There was a heat problem to boot , so it was about 40 degrees in the restaurant -- we had to request to uncheck our coats !
I am completely hooked on this place , it is ridiculous .
Love Al Di La
My wife and I also enjoyed the spinach , the Shanghai low mein , and other attractions .
Not worth it .
No thanks !!!
I thought I had died and gone to heaven .
I am a die hard peep lover .
It 's to die for !
I have known about this secret for the last 13 years , Emilio ( the Godfather ) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices .
We happened upon this place purely by accident and were pleased with the results .
Will never be back .
It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant , with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender , but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere .
I ca n't believe people complain about no cheese sticks ?
believe us , we 've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs .
Went here on a friend 's reccomendation .
If presentation and service is your thing , then this magic show works .
The service was very attentive and very generous .
You can also special order any kind of dumpling , etc .
The only thing more wonderful than the food ( which is exceptional ) is the service .
Place should also have a 1,2,3 chili rating to be more authentic ...
No refills on fountain drinks , though .
I think I 've had some the best meals of my life at minnow .
I 'm from sichuan , this is the restaurant I recommend going .
And it was quick which is very important .
Great survice
Prices are higher to dine in and their chicken tikka marsala is quite good .
I must give it Yon out of Yon stars !
Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else .
This is one of the best comfort food places in the city .
the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality .
My sister says it reminds her of a restaurant run by high-school students who do n't know what they are doing .
At $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you 're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture .
To give you an idea of how good we thought it was , we ended up going to Ping 's three weekends in a row !!!
It has been my first choice ever since I discovered it .
the wait staff is very friendly , if your not rude or picky ....... our meal at Leon last weekend was great - .
The banana tower is an amazing dessert as well .
However , they 've got the most amazing pastrami and the soups hit the spot .
I have been twice to this restaurant .
I ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor .
Check out the secret back room .
Nice ambiance , nice little bar , good bartender , Francois , and good service .
The food is so good and so popular that waiting can really be a nightmare .
Great Indian food
The music was fascinating , but left room for conversation , and the bartender made superb drinks .
There are other people waiting !
I wish I lived there as I would eat at this place as often as possible !
The cold sesame noodles , which are a freebie when you order $ 10 + , are delectable .
The food is terrible and overall , I would have to say avoid at all costs .
Celebrated my fathers birthday here .
Although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great .
It 's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend .
Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you 're with .
Hopefully next time , I will save room for dessert .
The combination of fresh tomato sauce , fresh mozz cheese , basil and the dough they make with imported flour , makes this is one of the better pizza 's in NY .
Its located in greenewich village .
I had the mango chicken and i ca n't go on to tell you how delicious that was and the presentation was beatiful .
It is simply amazing .
A bit breezy up there on the mezzanine from the wind coming from the tracks .
Worth the trip from Manhattan .
I loved this place !!
Highly recommend it !
I have been urged by friends for months to check out the mermaid inn .
Just go and see for yourself .
After 2 tries by the waiter to take it away ( we had n't even looked at it yet , we had full beers yet to drink ) , the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations .
The food is great and the prices are reasonable .
Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights .
From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff , I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it .
It is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY -- I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country .
The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music , and moreover , takes requests .
after dining at B.O.G over twenty times now , its official !
I have tried to make reservations , but both times , the hostess did n't have my name .
Atmosphere is a bore .
Then , IF they answer the phone , you 're lucky if they do n't hang up on you !
Fantastic !
Wo n't or Ca n't is not in the service directory .
Before the place did n't call my attention .
What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka . . some of which we never received !
His drinks are very inventive , delicious and classy .
Will give it another chance before I write it off .
This little place is wonderfully warm welcoming .
Edible but really a ripoff at those prices given whats in the area .
When you 're sitting in their main dining room ( which has a spectacular , hand-painted high ceiling ) you 'd never know there was a world outside .
Give it a try , menu is typical French but varied .
I go out to eat and like my courses , servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink .
Not enough wines by the glass either .
The portions are HUGE , so it might be good to order three things to split ( rather than one appetizer and entree per person ) for two people .
Tuk Tuk is my second favorite neighborhood Thai place ( the first being Joya ) .
Tasty steak , pork loin , the works .
The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I 've had at this price range .
Big and gawky on the outside .
There 's candlelight and music .
Please take my advice , go and try this place .
The lobster knuckles ( special of the day ) were ok , but pretty tasteless .
my first time here was with my gf for our 12 month anniversary .
But the best pork souvlaki I ever had is the main thing .
Read all the other review , they 'll confirm it .
I grew up on these bagels .
Cornelia Street looks like a Broadway set for West Side Story and the inside of Po is so cool quaint you really ca n't top the setting for a romantic dinner in NYC .
The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service .
Not pretentious and very economical .
Restaurant was dirty and unkempt .
Inexpensive , unassuming , great time !
It is very overpriced and not very tasty .
One of us actually liked the expresso - that 's it .
We ordered the chicken casserole , but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken , all dark meat and on the bone .
Zero ambiance to boot .
For the price , you can not eat this well in Manhattan .
Okay-i do n't mind the oily part ( cause most are cooked that way ) but it was way too bland .
Deff recimmend Bukhara they also have opened two new locations guess ill try them out .
First of all Dal Bukhara Rocks .
The one up front will smile and say What can I get for you , brother ?
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place .
night without a reservation , we had to wait at the bar for a little while , but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience .
The waitress was not attentive at all .
My boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent .
The food was almost always EXCELLENT .
We live in New Jersey and whenever we go into New York City we buy bagels to eat hot and then to freeze ( they told me that if I call in the order , they 'd bring it out to the car so I would n't have to look for parking ) .
Located at the end of a magnificent block .
The ambience is very calm and quiet .
NO more reservations , expensive tips and annoying stuff .
Katz 's has been a NYC original for over 100 years .
I 've eaten at all three locations and I always love , love the food , the service is always wonderful and the prices are really reasonable .
first it took us a long time to find the place .
He offers subpar service and has no personality .
those rolls were big , but not good and sashimi was n't fresh .
I had the Lamb special which was perfect .
We go often for lunch and the place is packed .
We 'd go back again
I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart 's for their food , the ambience and wonderful service .
Much more reasonably priced too !
We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods .
Rao is a good restaurant , but it 's nothing special .
Everything from the eggs benedict to the mussels and even the hamburger were done well and very tasty .
The chicken and falafel platters were nondescript combinations with fresh leaf salad .
So my husband made up an excuse so we can leave .
Nice atmosphere , the service was very pleasant and the desert was good .
I never write on these sites but this restaurant is def worth commending !
Have always found that the waiters will go out of their way to be helpful , despite the fact they are often busy with lots of diners .
Curioni 's Pizza has been around since the 1920 's .
My fav was the sassy lassi ...
I 'm sure I 'll return for a final judgement tho .
Here 's to the fake fish tanks too ...
She lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy .
not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly .
Service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique-seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience .
The service , wine selection , ambiance are all outstanding and deserve recognition .
My friend told me about this restaurant for a year before he finally took me this weekend .
so garantuan that you ca n't fit them in a toaster .
Obviously run by folks who know a pie .
Went there for an office lunch .
I recieved prompt service with a smile .
wont come back again for sure !
Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went .
Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything .
Wine list is extensive without being over-priced .
Cantinetta is a real treasure in a see of mediocre Italian restaurants .
It is terrific , as is the value .
They 're rude at times , and not very friendly .
This is the best Italian restaurant in the city .
Largest and freshest pieces of sushi , and delicious !
The dim sum is ok but does n't taste that fresh , and the little dishes do n't look steamy hot as they should ( also note lack of Chinese here ) .
I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong , it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent !!
Overall A oh ya even though there is waiting it is deff worth it
i would recommend reservations on weekends though .
Dessert was also to die for !
This is the first place I 've been that a runner remembers my order ... hope he likes his job because I have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant .
I have never eaten in the restaurant , however , upon reading the reviews I got take out last week .
THe perfect spot .
La Rosa waltzes in , and I think they are doing it the best .
Service is friendly , prices are good - delivery time was a little slow , but for the way this pizza tastes , I 'm willing to overlook it .
Others have to go to other restaurants and feel sad until they 're eaten .
We left after one drink .
Although somewhat loud , the noise was minimally intrusive .
Go only if you are already in the neighborhood and do n't want to bother going farther for a better place .
Ambiance is barely romantic but management tries .
They do cater to American palates , but if you like it hot let them know and they are more than willing to oblige !
We were wondering why they were there to make our dining experience miserable ?
Although small , it has beautiful ambience , excellent food ( the catfish is delicious - if ya do n't mind it a lil salty ) and attentive service .
The all-Italian staff is warm and engaging from the start .
A must try !
Overall I would recommend it and go back again .
BE CAREFUL before you request extra spice .
Everything is excellent , the menu is quite extensive , and you eat with a view on both sides of the city .
Eating in , the atmosphere saves it , but at your desk , it 's a very disappointing experience .
The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach .
The service is friendly , if not the most prompt in the world , the food is great , and the prices , while not cheap , wo n't put your wallet out of commission .
Best Italian food I ever had ( and being Italian , that means alot ) .
I 've lived in NY for 5 years and this place has it all .
I would recommend this place to anyone and would without a doubt come again .
The martinis are amazing and very fairly priced .
The large selection of bruschettas , paninis , tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating .
Went to Village last night for my birthday .
Price is high but the food is good , so I would come back again .
We will be back .
Can be a bit busy around peak times because of the size .
A different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) .
Service is excellent , no wait , and you get a lot for the price .
The staff greeted me warmly at the door and I was seated promptly and the food was excellent .
The help was extremely nice and did not rush us .
everyone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful .
Decor is nice and minimalist , food simple yet very well presented and cooked , and the wine list matches the food very well .
Stay away from the latter since you wo n't go for seconds ( hint hint ) .
The food -- though mostly deep-fried -- is simple and satisfying .
Could be pricey without a prix fixe meal .
Simple comfort food and what hot and lage portions .
I 'm glad I did as the food was very good and the staff was friendly , courteous and efficient .
The food here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it .
Odd for Ave B , not just odd , The place attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least .
Oh , and the complimentary pudding dessert was just enough - yummy !
in conclusion , THIS PLACE SUCKS !!!
Nothing better than buying a snapple for $ 3.25 too .
The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic .
I find that most Kosher restaurants are average to good , but this has been the best I 've eaten so far .
After waiting for almost an hour , the waiter brusquely told us he 'd forgotten to give the kitchen our order .
We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night .
So close , but not good enough .
Go there once and oh yes ... you will go back ... you will ...
SUM IT : local investment bankers like it , try for yourself at least once .
When I saw that their website had a link to da Ciro in Napoli , I knew there was going to be good pizza !
This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down .
The table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the service industry , I understood they were busy .
it is not consistent .
I come here enjoy very much with husband .
Ca n't wait to go back .
Not what I would expect for the price and prestige of this location .
This was a repeat visit and we 'll definitely be back again .
The food is good , I ca n't lie .
we love th pink pony .
Perhaps it was an off night , but it was suprisingly average for a 9.3 rating .
Everything about this place was wonderful .
-- Eat Club is a roving group of NYC gluttons
The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic , just simple , small and sparse .
Go with a group of friends and you will have a great time .
But that is highly forgivable .
The chicken dinner was real good .
These are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner :
Friendly and informative staff , very attentive and prompt raw bar service .
It 's also attached to Angel 's Share , which is a cool , more romantic bar ...
The staff has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often .
Try the mediterranean salad , it is a true experience for your taste buds !!
My wife and I were in NYC celebrating our 30th anniversary .
We were not disappointed .
This place is worth an one-hour drive .
At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at Bark you do n't just get your average hot dog .
This place is always packed .
Unbelievable .
Been going here since it opened have seen the quality value decrease considerably .
This place does n't compare with Mamoun 's in terms of price , freshness , value , and consisent quality , but that 's just my opinion .
A beautifully designed dreamy Egyptian restaurant that gets sceney at night .
Dieters stick to salads or indulge in vegetarian platters .
Dessert : pure disaster .
All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better !
Why ?
Oh and it 's too tiny for families with strollers .
The french fries -- with the kalmata dip were terrific !
Good food .
brick oven gallery is My pick for best pizza restaurant anywhere .
My only complaint might be the fortune cookies - I 've never had a cookie predict bad luck for me before I visited Kar .
My bf and I go to the walk-up counter and order a pie .
The staff members are extremely friendly and even replaced my drink once when I dropped it outside .
In addition , the food is very good and the prices are reasonable .
It was wonderful .
This is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates .
I recommend the black roasted codfish , it was the best dish of the evening .
I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee ( rice porridge ) .
I go twice a month !
The potato balls were not dry at all ... in fact it was buttery .
I 'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food .
However , being foodies , we were utterly disappointed with the food .
Stay away
For many people , this may not seem like Aunthentic Thai food because most places in NYC arent quite authentic .
( Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer !!!
Unlike HH up the block , this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels this town is known for .
Prices are fair across the board for both food and bev .
The food is great and reasonably priced .
We usually go to the Chart House to celebrate a birthday or anniversary .
Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment .
This diamond in the ruff is definitely worth my 10-minute walk from the 6 train .
The service was excellent and the food was delicious .
I 've never ordered anything else from their menu ... there 's no need to .
If you live outside the neighborhood , do n't bother !
The prices and ambience are especially great considering it 's in the West Village .
rice dishes and noodle dishes rarely exceed $ 5 and add on a refreshing ice drink for $ 2 and you 're set for the night !
I asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if I like Uni . (
Authentic Pakistani food .
To be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora .
A mix of students and area residents crowd into this narrow , barely there space for its quick , tasty treats at dirt-cheap prices .
Just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday .
You fellas above says its the best Taiwanese restaurant in town .
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently .
I complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted .
The pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap , frozen , shredded cheese common to most pizzaria 's .
I love Ess-a-bagel , but I live on the west side , so I often go to Murray 's for convenience .
You can not go wrong with this place .
Incredible food at a very agreable price brings me back just about every other day to this authentic Thai restaurant .
Some of the finest latin women you 'll see in your life hang out at Jimmy 's .
The photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real look .
Sauce was watery and the food did n't have much flavor .
I have to say the place was awesome .
Delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door .
The waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing .
Note that they do not serve beer , you must bring your own .
Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh , a delicious and sweet tasting bread .
If you like the food and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants , this is not the place for you .
Not only did they have amazing , sandwiches , soup , pizza etc , but their homemade sorbets are out of this world !
Be careful , when they say spicy , they mean it !
So rude !!!
We had a 3 hour brunch - they definitely do not rush you - and they kept the unlimited mimosas flowing the whole time .
We 'd walked by it dozens of times and finally settled on a Monday night .
The characters really make for an enjoyable experience .
The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so I try to ignore it ) .
Good bagels and good cream cheese .
The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals .
The menu , which changes seasonally , shows both regional and international influences .
Not worth the prices .
If you ware looking for Korean fusion , I suggest you try some of the places in the East Village .
Its also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car ( I happen to live in Inwood ) .
The food was so-so .
My fiance and I recently wanted to see the city and deceided to take a dinner cruise .
My steak au poivre was one of the worst I 've had .
Excellent lunch buffet for only $ 6.95 .
Not only was the waiter efficient and courteous , but also extremely helpful .
As many other reviewers noticed , your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time .
Everyone who works there ( the host , the bartender , the servers ) is so helpful .
We also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka .
Not the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant .
On the way out , we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues .
The red sliding doors may be unique but they do not block off the cold air from the outside .
My wife and I went to Orsay for Valentine 's dinner .
Will have to return to try the chocolate !
The buffet had a nice selection .
I recommend ordering in on a weeknight .
The first time the sushi was outstanding , the second time it was a little bland .
The crust is thin , the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly .
All we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner .
Based on the reviews for dinner , this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that , but definitely not for Dim Sum again .
Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else .
Whether it 's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar , you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite .
In the evening , this place attracted a well dressed , with it , NY crowd .
This is the Cheers of New York , whether you 've ever been there or not .
My first encounter happened one friday evening with a friend .
The unfortunate lady next to us thought she had ordered a salad ( including asking for salad dressing ) and was instead given a quesedilla .
The view is spectacular , and the food is great .
The side dishes were passable , and I did get a refill upon request .
Amma has the worst value for money I have experienced in NYC over the past 2 years .
Even though the place is not beautiful , the food speaks for itself .
My husband and I both ordered the Steak , medium .
really depends on your luck !
Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top .
In Short The Black Sheep distinguishes itself from the Midtown pub herd with a look that 's a mix of sports-bar butch and ornate kitsch .
And when I visit her I make it a point to eat at ' Ino at least once daily if not once for the whole trip .
my wife and i have been going to nyc for years and would n't miss roxy , s food is expensive but it 's new york !
I think the meatball parm is good .
The food was authentic .
new hamburger with special sauce is ok - at least better than big mac !
The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions .
Has the chef and owner changed ???
THEY HAVE WAITERS ON THE SIDEWALK TRYING TO PULL YOU IN WHICH MADE US SUSPICIOUS .
I am going to the mid town location next .
The traditional Italian items are great - cheap and served in a cozy setting .
Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet , where greasy , dry and tasteless are complimentary .
Service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded .
I would recommend Roxy 's for that , but not for their food .
It 's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend .
I had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz . of Maine Lobster in it .
This is where the aforementioned line was .
Good crowd , good outdoor seating , with a hip japanese vibe .
Downtown Dinner 2002 - Prixe fix : Appetizers were ok , waiter gave me poor suggestion . . try the potato stuff kanish best one .
They do n't concern much of customer 's health , just want to make money .
Their duck here is also absolutely delicious .
This place has great indian chinese food .
If you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great food and excellent service , this is the place .
I was a little leary about Mary 's at first - it 's small , crowded and you usually have to wait on line - but I 'm glad I finally tried it .
The hot and sour soup was unbearably hot and tasted of only pepper and nothing else .
The place was nice and calm .
The veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly .
But , nothing stands out about the cooking .
Food was very good , but not what I would consider out of this world .
If you like the food and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants , this is not the place for you .
Went here last night - nice decor , good service , but the food was surprisingly excellent .
Do not go to this restaurant .
Tables are close , so you better be comfortable bumping elbows with other patrons .
I liked the beer selection !
What makes this restaurant special are the authentic sichuan cooking and being the only one in NYC that offers authentic chongqing hotpot .
Appetizers took nearly an hour .
It 's charmingly small and that leads to an atmoshere that is extremely cozy and romantic , even .
I really liked this place .
Best Italian food I ever had ( and being Italian , that means alot ) .
The bagels always warm , soft on the inside , crispy on the outside and enormous in size .
for 7 years they have put out the most tasty , most delicious food and kept it that way ...
Another plus is most of the entrees are approx .
Best dish is nori-wrapped tuna .
The staff is very friendly .
The staff is very sharp and they look good too .
WORST PLACE ON SMITH STREET IN BROOKLYN
Me and my girls will definitely go back .
It could have been handled better .
My husband and I have been there at least 6 times and we 've always been given the highest service and often free desserts .
We got a little tipsy from the sake but is n't that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about ?
IT is the best deal in town for a Monday night dinner at a fine restaurant .
I would not recommend this place to anyone .
But dinner here is never disappointing , even if the prices are a bit over the top .
The staff is no nonsense .
Suan was a recommendation that I am glad we heeded .
Good spreads , great beverage selections and bagels really tasty .
I have eaten here several times before attending an afternoon performance .
I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try .
We had Pam 's special fried fish and it was amazing .
) It 's not the best Japanese restaurant in the East Village , but it 's a pretty solid one for its modest prices , and worth repeat visits .
Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the thai food is excellent too .
We were on our way back to NJ , and since I am in NY , we figured why not grab some food ?
I think the stuff was better than Disney .
I noted it was crossed off on the bill .
This establishment is the real deal .
We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it .
Took my mom for Mother 's Day , and the maitre d' was pretty rude .
Everyone treats you like you were part of the family .
The location and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it .
The barebecued salmon is elegantly spiced and not at all dry .
I think the stuff was better than Disney .
Well ... they can run but they ca n't hide .
There are other people waiting !
At first i was rolling my ideas of yet another French place on the UES .
not only is the food
Everything that happened was not even up to mediocre .
Have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience .
expectations were real hi reading the ' 10 's ' .
When he finally did , he was unable to make a gin and tonic -- could n't find tonic .
My husband had the mesclun , salmon , and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses .
Joya used to be a cool spot with decent food and a colorful - if not relaxed - atmosphere .
it 's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food .
They also have a great assortment of wraps if your not in the mood for traditional Mediterranean fare .
Several of the dim sum orders had about 6-8 pieces .
All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends !
Anytime and everytime I find myself in the neighborhood I will go to Sushi Rose for fresh sushi and great portions all at a reasonable price .
We visit at least once a month .
The waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing .
Open late ( well as late as I ever got there and I 'm a night person )
Its not curry in a slurry crap , and regular run of the mill food .
The bread is the soft paratha bread ( unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta ) , and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful .
i 've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine , if not good .
One of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood .
This quiet dark asian bistro is well worth the trip .
When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets , and then ordered for them .
I went there with my friend last saturday .
Go here .
Coming from Boston this place is like Emma 's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge ( although they have more funky toppings ! )
Good , dark atmosphere and the music is a nice touch .
But they 've done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials like the Godmother pizza ( a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil-brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual ) .
I have dined at Mammino several times now and each time it gets bettter .
My boyfriend and I were in NY for a few days and Pastis was a place that came recommended .
I just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal for such little money .
Not to sound too negative but be wary of the delivary .
Leon is an East Village gem : casual but hip , with well prepared basic French bistro fare , good specials , a warm and lively atmosphere .
Some of the workers ignore me and talk to the female customers , other times , they 've skipped my order .
The sushi is cut in blocks bigger than my cell phone .
I had to wait for my friend at the bar for a few minutes
Authentic Taiwanese food that 's cheap ... what more could you ask for ?
As a fan of Thai , I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst .
Great sake !
They outshine HH .
I often go there to eat with my family .
The service is really fast and friendly , and the value is great .
But for whatever reason , prices are about twice as high .
I went here with a friend on a whim , we went someplace else first and could n't get a table .
Saul is pretty good , but definitely not great .
i especially like their soft shell crab sandwich with fries .
The pizza was pretty good and huge .
Please take my advice , go and try this place .
My friends and I showed up on a Sat .
I brought some buddies from CA and they loved it .
They need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the place is consistent .
The food tasted very good .
Thanks Bloom 's for a lovely trip .
If you go , try the marinara/arrabiatta sauce , the mozzarella en Carozza is mmmmmmmm .... . everything is just delicious .
A guaranteeed delight !
The food is delicious .
For those of you who do n't know , Uni is Sea Urchin in Japanese , which happens to be my favorite . )
In any event , even though its a bit on the pricey side , we still love this restaurant and will definitely go back .
It 's better than being on the roof of Sutton Place with 19 year old interns jabbing you in the ribs all night .
I went this past Saturday and had a excellent meal of consisting of a braised lamb shank with mashed potatoes .
Whem asked , we had to ask more detailed questions so that we knew what the specials were .
One of the BEST
For the people who want great food plus great service , Roxy is a place to AVOID !
One of us actually liked the expresso - that 's it .
It 's just everything ... the food , the atmosphere ... the incrediby kind and gracious hostess .
Arigato Gozimas Yuka !
I will be going back very soon .
Do n't ever bother - the drinks were awful , but it was the people who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining .
The crowd was older and the restaurant is very cramped , but it has old school charm .
my picks are : - Scallion Pancake ( fried with vegetable juice , very special and tasty ) - Guizhou Chicken - Shredded Squid Family Style ( one of my personal favorites ) - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab - Shuizhu Fish ( this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans , I would n't recommend to my American friends as it 's very spicy .
We shared a bottle of sake , an order of edamames , and she had the sushi plate while I had the sashimi .
Moules were excellent , lobster ravioli was VERY salty !
Great food , great lay out and awesome service .
The service was poor , restaurant poorly lit , staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald 's than this joint .
Great find in the West Village !
Over 100 different choices to create your own .
I think the pizza is so overrated and was under cooked .
We arrived and were seated immediately , which made us both happy .
Great find !!!
The sauce on the pizza is sooo good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they do n't skimp .
good place to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic french dish over a glass of wine .
This is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together .
We thought this a prelude to what the evening will be like .
Less = More in their case .
What an amazing meal and experience !
In fact , it appears he is going to go postal at any moment .
A little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite .
My gf 's duck confitte was very solid as well , although i have little base of reference .
The production is a symphony , alot of fun to experience.The food sublime for the most part .
The food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare , the dishes are never a disappointment .
The service is excellent , the decor is great , and the food is delicious and comes in large portions .
For Park avenue I expected so much more .
This is a real gem of a place .
The food was wonderful and imaginative .
we spent 50 $ $ definetly will come back with my friends !!!
I will definetly be going back .
Not a typical pizza joint , but good for a low key and fairly cheap nice sit down dinner .
Average to good Thai food , but terrible delivery .
It is LOUD , HOT and DARK .
This is definitely an excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the night scene is more than alive .
My boyfriend and I are avid restaurant goers , and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended Flatbush Farms .
The service was dreadfully slow ( the place was only half full ) and a smile would have been nice ...
Avoid at all costs .
I absolutely suggest this place .
The service is good and the resturant is clean .
I highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try .
The food was excellent as well as service , however , I left The Four Seasons very dissappointed .
Ravioli was good ... but I have to say that I found everything a bit overpriced .
just got back from lunch at Tamarind and it was excellent .
Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn .
Not a small feat for good french food in the area .
Try the crunchy tuna , it is to die for .
Tiny dessert was $ 8.00 ... just plain overpriced for what it is .
And , the honey BBQ rib tips are yummy !
Chinese Desserts are known for healthful benefits in addition to the sweetness .
I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant , and the food was majorly disappointing .
We went to this restaurant based on prior internet comments .
When I arrived at Orsay I was thrown back , in a veyr good sense .
The food is delicious and beautifully prepared along with the friendly and personable service .
noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST !
If it is n't for the food ( A + + + ) , it must be the service or the ambience .
One caveat : Some of the curried casseroles can be a trifle harsh .
You could get a much better dining experience for the same amount of money in a lot of other French Bistros .
Scalina Fedeli reminded me why service is so integral to fine dining .
those rolls were big , but not good and sashimi was n't fresh .
Aside from the rushed service , we were very impressed with the food and the drinks .
This restaurant was recommended by a local ... as a matter of fact , he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed !
This is the perfect spot for meeting friends , having lunch , dinner , pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks !
If you 're lucky and there 's not a private party going on back there , you 'll get a chance to really chill out .
I can not recommend OG more highly if I tried - check it out for yourself .
The food was very good , a great deal , and the place its self was great .
Well , this place is so Ghetto its not even funny .
I 'm partial to the Gnocchi .
The food really is n't very good and the service is terrible .
it helps if you know what to order .
I tried a couple other dishes but was n't too impressed .
THE SERVICE IS PERFECT TOO NOTHING WRONG IN THIS ITALIAN/FRENCH RESTAURANT
The puke green walls leave a lot to be desired , but the food is very good .
I took my girlfriend there for her birthday last night and we had a relaxing , really good meal .
With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering , the food here was decent , not great .
good music , great food , speedy service affordable prices .
One would think we 'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead , we got a snobby waiter would n't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so .
Katz 's deli is a great NY experience .
The food is mostly made from scratch , fresh and well prepared .
- for dessert we split chocolate cake and vanilla gelato ( with espresso ) , which were tasty , but I thought a bit overpriced .
I was pleasantly suprised .
We been there and we really enjoy the food , was areally great food , and the service was really good .
Great place to relax and enjoy your dinner
Generously garnished , organic grilled burgers are the most popular dish , but the Jerusalem market-style falafel wraps and Mediterranean salads -- layered with beets , goat cheese and walnuts -- are equally scrumptious .
We ate outside at Haru 's Sake bar because Haru 's restaurant next door was overflowing .
Delivery can be spot on or lacking depending on the weather and the day of the week .
hmmm .
THe perfect spot .
we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant , then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers .
The pasta penne was pretty extra buttery , creamy which means a big task to diggest . . tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count , penne ... got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed ... lol
Our tiny table for two ( dinner plates hung over edge ) was right in the middle of one of the lanes of waiter traffic .
The website and rating makes this place look wonderful but in reality it was very disappointing .
Old school meets New world .
As a fan of Thai , I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst .
I will definetly be going back .
We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods .
Service not the friendliest to our " large party " !
The servers give you some sample slices of your order while you wait ( shortly I might add ) .
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta ( raddichio was kind of bitter though ) .
In fact , you ca n't miss it .
Food was average but tasty .
Great neighborhood joint .
Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens , this is among the best .
We love the food , drinks , and atmosphere !
THE SERVICE IS AMAZING , i 've had different waiters and they were all nice , which is a rare thing in NYC .
Horrible food and Horrible service .
If you live in new york city , you 'll find better food at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount .
This is the MOST wonderful restaurant in all of New York City , not just Brooklyn ...
Buon appetito !
It ' only open for lunch but the food is so good !
I sometimes see the waiters do n't have enough knowledge of their dishes .
Went to this place this place on a real cold night and needed a quick meal .
We only ordered desserts and drinks , but no refills were offered .
So I 've never actually been to M proper , but I 've had it delivered a few times .
You can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience , but for superb food at reasonable prices , La Villa ca n't be beat .
I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .
The bagels always warm , soft on the inside , crispy on the outside and enormous in size .
Go , go , hurry , before everyone finds out about it .
And really large portions .
If you 're looking for a place to sit down , have a drink and conversations with friends , go to sweet-n-tart and order yourself a hong-kong styled milk and tea with tapioca pearls ( hot ) .
If you live in Upper Manhattan , Siam Square is THE place for Thia food .
skip dessert .
Whatever the reason it is definitely the place to be .
I recommend the jelly fish , drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings , certainly the stir fry blue crab .
i actually feel like i should keep it a secret .
Highly recommended ... As stated , I have n't dined * in * the restaurant but stopped by there to pick up takeout and it seems a very relaxing place ; also , the bar looks nice .
The waiter was attentive .
Food was okay , nothing great .
There were no communications issues either , as she spoke perfect English .
And evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful .
Emilio , the owner , is often sitting in the front table greeting guests as they come and go .
The design is very intimate and romantic .
I loved it and would go again .
For appetizers , I recommend the shrimp fritters and dumplings .
The room is a little plain , but it 's difficult to make such a small place exciting and I would not suggest that as a reason not to go .
This is also where I was from .
Their sushi , Kamikaze and other Rolls are fresh and well presented .
The atmosphere was great .
Great food and the prices are very reasonable .
I CAN EAT HERE EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK REALLY LOL LOVE THIS PLACE ... )
Just remember , the later you go , the longer you may have to wait .
this place ... we stumbled upon it on labor day weekend .
This place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area .
We had a birthday party here recently and the food and service was amazing .
I was very impressed by this low-key upper eastsider and their authentically thai cuisine !!!
As much as I like the food there , I ca n't bring myself to go back .
But the thing that my wife and I hated was it was so loud and it felt like ' bar ' or ' pub ' .
With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored .
The service was excellent and the food was delicious .
In summer-eat outside on a terrace ( another great feature of Suan ) !!!
Will give it another chance before I write it off .
It 's very spicy but not offensive .
The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back .
Slow service , but when you 're hanging around with groups of 10 or 20 , who really notices ?
Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went .
Their eggplant is so delicate , sweet tender !
And the food is fantastic .
Avoid this place !
The spicy tuna and salmon are the best we 've ever had .
Very neighborhoody , very quick and sufficient .
Both the fresh mozzerella slices and the Plain Cheese slice are phenomenal .
I have been going back again and again .
This restaurant used to be our regular Thursday night dinner location .
I 've been several times and am totally smitten .
Perhaps .
We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh .
Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat .
I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend .
The hot dogs are good , yes , but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich , perfect on its supermarket squishy bun .
A one women show !
We 've never had any problems with the staff but maybe we 've been lucky ?
With so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district , is truly an excellent find !
The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty .
The food was good too .
The food is decent at best , and the ambience , well , it 's a matter of opinion , some may consider it to be a sweet thing , I thought it was just annoying .
A large is $ 20 , and toppings are about $ 3 each .
The food is outstanding and the service is quick , friendly and very professional .
My girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .
The buffet had a nice selection .
For dinner I had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan .
Make sure you have the Spicy Scallop roll . . .
The staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York .
Worth a visit .
I had the Thai style Fried Sea Bass ... which was very good .
The pizza is good though .
It 's really a takeaway place , I would n't sit if I could take it home .
And where does Patis go wrong ; no where .
Excellent sashimi , and the millennium roll is beyond delicious .
Veal Parmigana - Better than Patsy 's !
The staff is courteous and friendly .
The food arrived 20 minutes after I called , cold and soggy .
I have been going there since it opened and I ca n't get enough .
I visit New Green Bo when I have money or when I am broke .
Raymond the bartender rocks !
While the staff at this little bistro is very friendly , I have never experienced more incompetency .
The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty .
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money .
There are numerous shavue restaurants in LA , but few out here .
I plan to come here again and look forward to trying their assortment of bruschetta , panini 's .....
The wine list is extensive and impressive .
Food is great and inexpensive .
While their kitchen food is delicious , their Sushi is out of this world .
Acceptable prices .
VT is what baby pizzas hope to be when they grow up .
This is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood .
Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything .
My six year old loved it .
I have eaten at Shabu Tatsu at least 5 times and I always want to go back for more !
I highly recommend it .
Meanwhile , the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil , gratis .
I went to pams with my girlfriend , and i love it .
Authentic Shanghai style and I can not recommend a better Shanghai place in New York .
They have a delicious banana chocolate dessert , as well as a great green tea tempura .
Very good service and very good prices .
I ordered a Chicken Teriyaki dish and found that the chicken was extremely dry .
Food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience ) .
Waiters are slow but sweet .
The only thing that strikes you is the decor ? ( not very pleasant ) .
Yeah , sometimes the service can be slow .
Will not be back .
I plan on stopping by next week as well .
Metrazur has a beautiful spot overlooking the main terminal .
Yet paired with such rude service , would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there .
Paul , the maitre d' , was totally professional and always on top of things .
While it 's not Nobu , it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full .
its a little out of the way if you do n't live in the neighborhood , but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are .
As a retired hipster , I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city .
Most people eat there seem to be typical Upper East Side snobs , so be aware .
We always go there on the weekends and leave extremely full and satisfied .
I came to this restaurant expecting to be surprised but left bored and overcharged .
We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods .
What 's the difference between the two ?
I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fine Indian dining experience that is definitely a value for your dollar .
It was delish and I did n't feel bad eating it .
Its good to go there for drinks if you do n't want to get drunk because you 'll be lucky if you can get one drink an hour the service is so bad .
Plain and simple it 's bad thai food .
Service is extraordinary , yet not overbearing , and the decor brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens .
Consistently good Japanese Tapas .
The well mannered , pleasant staff that Tony has in his employ .
Anyone who ever dined at a thai restaurant is in for a huge disappointment .
The food is great and authentic .
Will not be back .
Authentic Shanghai style and I can not recommend a better Shanghai place in New York .
The skillfully chosen Portuguese cheese cart paired with quality port provides the perfect Iberian ending .
I went to Common Stock for brunch and I was so impressed .
The location is perfect .
The pasta primavera was outstanding as well , lots of fresh veggies .
But they do n't have a toaster , which is strange .
The staff is no nonsense .
Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months .
Expensive
There are no negatives to speak of .
But trust me it is so worth it .
But the coconut rice was good .
I will go back to Suan soon !
The place is sleek , modern and playfull and i will return again frequently .
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere .
A quintessential slice of NYC pizza .
The food is surprisingly good , and the decor is nice .
I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service .
Service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great .
My Chelsea 's impressive and creative menu includes modern , Westernized Japanese dishes such as Foie Gras Unagi Napolean , Jap style hamburger steak , spicy cod roe spaghetti , black cod with miso base , and rack of lamb in black truffle sauce , to name a few .
Would NEVER go back there .
Do n't eat here unless you 're starving for thai food and you work next door .
Service was very good - prompt , attentive and non-intrusive .
Great selection of wine , and seafood .
Fine , I wont hang you for that .
It 's a steal !
Once they ran out of Gnochi and made it for me from scratch !
SO SO SO SO SO good !
When I got there the place was packed but they made sure to seat me quickly .
Casablanca servces delicious falafel , tabouleh , humus and other Mediterranean delights , which are all very inexpensive .
I live nearby and when they first opened , I ate there a lot .
Tasty but expensive .
Food was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly , but I can say this is one of the best I 've had .
The fried rice is amazing here .
The boutique selection of wines covers a wide variety without being imposeing .
We were exploring Grand Central and did n't want to eat in the food court .
I love the drinks , esp lychee martini , and the food is also VERY good .
This place , which is only a few months old , is perhaps Queens ' biggest secret !
amazing fresh dogs but best of all endless toppings !!!
Single Worst Restaurant in Manhattan
Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable .
My daughter and I left feeling satisfied ( not stuffed ) and it felt good to know we had a healthy lunch .
and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs .
The restaurant was packed at first , so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated .
I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date .
We were less than impressed .
I do n't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron 's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff ( more than the price ) .
I heartily recommend .
I highly recommend this restaurant !!
No plans to return anytime soon .
Great food , good size menu , great service and an unpretensious setting .
I recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys fine cuisine at reasonable prices .
i know , you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored , but my agenda is i 'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends , seeking a pleasant experience .
We ordered lamb which was perfectly cooked and tasted awesome .
You ca n't go wrong with this place .
I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan .
they really provide a relaxing , laid-back atmosphere .
All are GREAT - poori , naan , paratha all FRESH .
Sushi so fresh that it crunches in your mouth .
Reliable , Fresh Sushi
highly recommended .
I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors .
Never again !
I got enough reasons to keep coming back !!!
The food is inventive but still keeps traditional indian flavoring .
No plans to return anytime soon .
Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm , but the open kitchen is part of the charm .
Now at the top of our list , Del Frisco 's Steakhouse .
We 've always gotten amazing service and we love the food .
Unless you are eating in the Pizzeria side of this place , and are not in a rush , this place is a bad idea .
Not one to jump to complaints ( hence my lack of previous online reviewing ) , I called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations .
And I hate to say this but I doubt I 'll ever go back .
My husbands was perfect , my was well done and dry .
Get it together .
My wife and I will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them , as they tend to offer large portions .
My suggestion is to eat family style because you 'll want to try the other dishes .
Everyone raved about the atmosphere ( elegant rooms and absolutely incomparable views ) and the fabulous food !
Our son loves pizza and we have a certified Neapolitan pizzaria in our home city ( Seattle ) , we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant .
While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine , our son 's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert .
This place is a great stop for great food .
I do n't get it , what 's so special about Prune ?
Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you .
Easily the worst stir-fried squid I 've ever tasted .
" The menu includes pub fare -- burgers , steaks and shepherds pie -- and even a portabella lasagna for those black sheep known as " vegetarians .
I would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices .
Get the soup and a nosh ( pastrami sandwich ) for $ 8 and you 're golden .
The food was very good , a great deal , and the place its self was great .
The wine is always good , the tapas are always yummy , especially with the warm pita bread .
Best Chinese on the Upper East , prompt delivery , good value .
This place is worth going even if only for their beer .
For authentic Thai food , look no further than Toons .
Overall , not worth the money .
When the main course finally arrived ( another 45mins ) half of our order was missing .
The place is beautiful !
Still , any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house ...
It was huge , delicious , fresh , and will be the reason we return .
Our favorite meal is a pesto pizza , the house salad , and a good bottle of wine .
Sure , everyone 's got their favorite , but to know Sal , is to know New York .
The service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing .
I have tried literally every restaurant on curry row .
Oh yeah ever on the west side try there sister resturant Arties Cafe .
So , I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it .
I ca n't wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic patio .
Maybe I say so because it looked promising for people who like artery-clogging jewish deli food , but turns out to be poorly run and awful .
Service was very good - prompt , attentive and non-intrusive .
Great Atmosphere
Try their plain pizza with fresh garlic or eggplant .
Try it !
Again , if you are in this neighborhood - by all means , come here .
The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes .
being a fan of spicy ethnic foods , indian included , i made friends with this place long ago .
While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance , and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City , the food was not what I had hoped for .
if you 're looking for perfect traditional sushi , go here - if you 're looking for interesting combinations , try sushi of gari 's ( east side ) .
That place was awesome , , , sally !
I have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a mushroom consomme - and this chef accomplishes without fats .
Food is excellent .
Go with the specials , and stay away from the salmon .
keep up the good work .
Slightly on the pricey side but worth it !
This is a consistently great place to dine for lunch or dinner .
So for a filling and healthy meal give it a go .
I had Filet Mignon with garlic mash .
Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood .
Our waiter was helpful and charming , the food was perfect , and the wine was good , too .
Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza ( as I love La Pizza Fresca ) .
The DJ is awesome , I have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and I keep going back .
Was there Friday night .
When going out for a nice dinner , I like a nice ambiance as well as very good food .
Went on a 3 day oyster binge , with Fish bringing up the closing , and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended , because it was so great !
After hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant , and passing by it on a daily basis , we decided to try .
They never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table .
I have eaten at Saul , many times , the food is always consistently , outrageously good .
I do n't remember what we had ; nothing was memorable .
I just read Mocaramel 's review and felt compelled to respond .
Hey , I think $ 2 + for a 5 block walk ai n't bad .
You must try the shrimp appetizers .
The staff offers impeccable service .
What a ripoff !
This place started off a little iffy , but is now one of my favorite indian restaurants in NYC ( and I 'm indian , so I should know ) .
They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile !
just walk by the window and see all the unbiased positive reviews in all the major nyc publications .
Best Pastrami I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous .
Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant .
It is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY -- I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country .
The falafal was rather over cooked and dried but the chicken was fine .
Really nice restaurant to go with a group or on a date .
The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food .
This is n't your corner Chinese food takeout .
Service was among the best I have ever had in NYC .
The place 's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh .
I hate this .
I went to Ruby Foos for my birthday and enjoyed our experience there .
A great way to make some money is to buy a case of snapple from Costco and sell it right outside for only $ 2.50 .
The hostess said " Wow that 's a large group , unless you are n't together " , to which I replied " no we are , and there will be one more , so a table for six please . "
Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town !
The decoration was feeling like we was on the Cairo , actually the street is part of that adventure .
My first time there I happened not to like the Crab Croquette apt that i ordered and they were happy to change it for me without making no big deal .
The only other steakhouse that seems to hold a candle to Roth 's is the Strip House .
for out-of-towners who will get a big thrill out of the location !
The sake menu should not be overlooked !
Even though the restaurant was packed , we were seated promptly and even asked for a table upstairs with no problems .
So eat fast and order a lot .
I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED !
i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family .
Le Pere Pinard has a $ 15 pre-theater menu that is outstanding .
The service we experienced was friendly and good .
Our food was great too !
The decor is dark , cool and soothing , while the food 's presentation is spectacular , considering the low prices .
He takes real pride in his food and his business .
The other times I 've gone it 's romantic date heaven , you can walk in get a booth by the windows , be treated like a VIP in a not-crowded place , with great food and service .
I live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of The Pizza Place at 3am .
My husbands was perfect , my was well done and dry .
I 've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times , but more often I order delivery .
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty . hmmm .
I have been going back again and again .
It is terrific , as is the value .
I have been going to this restaurant for years , in the past the service was average and the food inconsistant .
Heartland Brewery is a great way to start or finish your day .
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested .
Why do people rave about the ambience .
Save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one !
We concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake , both were delicious .
Our teenage kids love it , too .
Cute and decorative .
No one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our plates .
Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top .
The lox is always fresh too .
Try everything for that matter , it is all good .
Ess-A-Bagel ( either by Sty-town or midtown ) is by far the best bagel in NY .
Also they were $ 15 each !
There was a small wait , but shorter than I expected .
Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table .
And you 're hungry a few hours later .
This place is the most Japanese it can ever get .
It was divine melts in your mouth .
I 've enjoyed 99 % of the dishes we 've ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional too-authentic-for-me dish ( I 'm a daring eater but not THAT daring ) .
My husband said he could 've eaten several more , the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had .
Three page wine menu , one page entree and horedevous .
My host asked for appetizers for the group and the waiter gave us not only what we ordered , but some other items that were not ordered .
The only concern i have is with the slighly all-business waitstaff who order and throw the food down , rushing you out .
The food was good .
I have no idea why this restaurant is so often overlooked .
After we got our sashimi order , I could not believe how small the portions were !
The rest of the dim sum , though pricey by Chinatown standards , is worth it .
At the end you 're left with a mild broth with noodles that you can slurp out of a cup .
I read the other review and have to say I had the opposite experience here last Sunday .
Though it 's been crowded most times I 've gone here , Bark always delivers on their food .
What more could you want ?
You will find yourself returning quite often .
It does n't look like much on the outside , but the minute you walk inside , it 's a whole other atmosphere .
The wine the service was very good too .
The wine list is excellent .
Good atmosphere , combination of all the hottest music dress code is relatively strict except on Fridays .
From the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the place was packed .
The waiter was attentive .
The service is awful .
i have eaten here on a different occasion - the food is mediocre for the prices .
The wine and cheese plate are plentiful and ca n't wait to try the fondue or table grilling .
I 'm looking forward to going back soon and eventually trying most everything on the menu !
for Meetball Night .
The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger , to steak , to escargot .
It was so bad I actually refused to pay for my food .
It just was n't Thai .
Among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants , this offers by far one of the best values for your money .
If you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained , this is a great place to go and eat .
I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible .
Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the thai food is excellent too .
Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon , which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave.
The food is wonderful , tasty and filling , and the service is professional and friendly .
sometimes i get bad food and bad service , sometimes i get good good and bad service .
We had the most wonderful waitress .
The sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are innovative and delicious .
I 've always been seated propmtly .
Came looking for this place because I heard good things .
It 's cute and simple and I loved it .
This place has the best sushi in the city .
Try the Pad Thai , it 's fabulous and their prices are so cheap !
The service does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but I have never been treated rudely .
This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart 's and I must say how delicous the food and the service was .
however , it 's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .
i do n't usually order wine with indian so i ca n't comment on their wine list or their wines .
Suan is a great place that I often take my friends ( classmates ) too .
The service is pretty good .
I 've been to several places for Dim Sum and this has got to be the WORST .
My boyfriend and I went here last night and LOVED it !
The food here does a great service to the name ( Cantonese that is ... ) .
We were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion ... a bucket of food literally .
He not only makes his own homemade mozzarella , but every pie is ultra fresh .
This place is pricey , and yes , the food is worth it ; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price .
( i hang out , and live , in the neighborhood . . )
The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great .
If you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde .
Raga 's is a romantic , cozy restaurant .
If we were to move from the upper east side , we would genuinely miss this restaurant .
Especially liked chicken tikka and the naan , and the dals .
great experience overall .
One of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu in a positive way .
Boy was I wrong !
Everything on the menu is great .
The Waitstaff were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal .
I love the atmorphere @ peep !
A cool place to hang with your friends for a couple of healthy drinks and desserts .
I like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing .
The pizza was really good .
I have to agree with the previous reviewer .
There was a great deal for 6 Blue Point oysters and a beer or glass of wine for $ 8 !
The food is consistant and good but how it got name Best Diner In Manhattan is beyond me .
My friends spoke so much about it for months , I finally made the time to come down ear and dine in .
The most annoying thing , though , is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue .
And I say snacking because it really is not set up to be a proper dinner .
I have been to Mary 's many times and I like it .
You can not go wrong with this place .
Sexy .
Just go in and sample the greatest french food west of Daniel .
Not too crazy about their sake martini .
Owner is pleasant and entertaining .
I could n't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table .
Everytime I go there I ca n't pick anything to eat and not because the menu is filled with great things to eat .
In fact there is only one I 've tried that even compares ( shabu Tatsu ) and even then I prefer Dokebi .
The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed .
The foie gras was sweet and luscious .
The food is very good for it 's price , better than most fried dumplings I 've had .
bottles of wine are cheap and good .
The food was delicious ( I had a halibut special , my husband had steak ) , and the service was top-notch .
We always have a delicious meal and always leave feeling satisfied .
The menu consisted of standard brassiere food , better then places like Balthazar etc .
Look foward to trying the Ruben upon returning .
If you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo .
Nice place though .
Frankly , when you compare what you can have here for lunch , versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city , there is no comparison .
The staff has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often .
Love the scene first off - the place has a character and nice light to it . . very fortunate , location wise .
A gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order .
I really recommend the very simple Unda ( Egg ) rolls .
I had fish and my husband had the filet - both of which exceeded our expectations .
The food was exceptional .
If the weather is nice , try to snag an outside table .
I wo n't go back unless someone else is footing the bill .
Loved it !
Both were very good , but nothing you could n't get at similar restaurant .
Having discovered Ping 's on the internet , we entered with qualms but were instantly put to ease by the fish tanks that greet you as u walk in .
