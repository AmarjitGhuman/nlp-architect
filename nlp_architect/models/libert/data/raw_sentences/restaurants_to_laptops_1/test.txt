It suddenly can not work .
I have just had to learn to be a little harder typer than on my last computer .
They say sorry out of warranty .
If you really want a bang-up system and do n't need to run Windows applications , go with an Apple ;
The applications are also very easy to find and maneuver , much easier than any other computer I have ever owned .
Put a cover on it and is a little better but that is my only complaint .
If you do n't feel comfortable doing it yourself , just buy the case and be happy , plus it looks nice , I bought the white one from Best Buy .
I do not recommend this company or their products !!!!
I go to purchase it on line , and I find out that the device will not be available until almost two months later !
This system is not worth the money or trouble trying to get it fix .
At 16 months it started shutting off after only 5 or 10 minutes .
Did I mention everything about it , from size to weight to keyboard screams BULK ?
I 'll stick to Tashiba .
This laptop has only 2 USB ports , and they are both on the same side .
This is my second MacBook .
but in resume this computer rocks !
A couple things you should know :
Keyboard is great , very quiet for all the typing that I do .
My previous purchases were with Dell and HP .
If you 're looking for a great laptop , you 've found the best here .
Recommended to people as their first laptop .
The improvements to the OS have been relatively gradual , but substantive .
The computer blinks it shuts off at will .
And having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare .
they have not sent a new one nor called .
We used PC products - it seemed simpler to continue with the same thing .
However , this will be my last as well .
I initially purchased my Macbook Pro 13 " in April , and I loved it .
Overall , this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from .
I chose the iBookG4 , a laptop that is an attractive computer with a large screen big enough to please anyone .
And the warranty on this macbook pro can last up to 5 years or 1000 battery recharge cycles .
It 's the inside that is truly wonderful .
Unfortunately , Apple 's quality has continued to slide .
I dual boot with Linux and that other security-prone OS and it performs flawlessly .
I was so happy with my new Mac .
I could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat .
I absolutely love my mac !
I love the size , keyboard , the functions .
I just love this lap top , I just wish it were all silver or they had all black .
I use iphoto all the time , which is a great program for anyone who is into photography - amateurs and experts alike .
The 17 inch screen is very large , but the computer is very light .
Design : very durable .
My parents bought it for me as a graduation gift , and i 'm totally ( almost kind of maybe definitely ) obsessed with it .
However , the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary ( unless you 're gaming ) .
HAVING HAD EXPERIENCE WITH A TOSHIBA LAPTOP , I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT THE TOSHIBA NB305 LAPTOP HAS MAJOR PROBLEMS .
Before I begin , I will say that I am not like a good percentage of the people that will end up writing a review on this computer - I am not an Apple fanboy .
Now I know !
It really is perfect for work and play .
I had to call HP and ask for a recovery disk because the computer does not come with one and completely redo it all .
it 's exactly what i wanted , and it has all the new features and whatnot .
A little pricey but it is well , well worth it .
This laptop serves all my needs .
now he mows yards so he can earn the money for the wireless internet .
Because he said that the hinge is under the motherboard and they have to dismantle the whole thing before it can be tightened .
2 ) Blue screen first month
The Mac Snow Leopard O/S is extremely easy to use , although very different than Win XP , Visa or Win7 .
We did n't because it was already over 2,400 dollars !
It turns out that this hp pc had been preciously sold by Wal Mart .
English must have been his third or fourth language .
I bought this laptop Was the worst Laptop I 've ever bought .
It has come into good use for my finances , scheduling , my parents business expenses , and it is definitely amazing for gaming .
The black model also has a very nice seamless appearance - one of the better looking notebooks I 've seen .
Obviously one of the most important features of any computer is the " human interface .
I do find that my MacBook has a lot more bells and whistles than a normal PC especially if you enjoy technology , downloading pictures and graphic design .
I like it so much , I bought another just for my wife .
It easily fits into most computer bags but does n't weigh down a backpack or satchel when being carried with spirals and/or textbooks .
I paid about the same for my Toshiba as I did for the compaq a few years back .
It seemed to be a very nice laptop except I was not able to load my Garmin GPS software or Microsoft Office 2003 .
Would do business again .
Now I could get myself a cheap computer , that will probably work a whole lot better !
To list a few : They tend to get hot enough to cause 3rd degree burns , as well as ignite any flamable material if near the part that happens to heat up .
return it .
Now that I have upgraded to Lion I am much happier about MAC OS and have just bought an iMac for office .
With a MAC computer I have more free time as I do n't have to wait for windows to boot up or shut down and all the viruses associated with windows .
You can imagine that an expensive item as a laptop will not be left on your front steps , it needs signature to pove that you received it .
The Dell mini was the first Dell product that I had ever purchased .
they improved nothing else such as Resolution , appearance , cooling system , graphics card , etc .
So , the hard disk capacity really does n't matter to me .
The speakers on it are useless too .
There are reviews that speak to a few possible glitches but , I have n't seen them yet .
The cons are more annoyances that can be lived with .
I do not know for sure .
You will love this macbook if you choose to buy it .
I love the operating system and the preloaded software .
I am very happy I bought this Mac , well worth the extra money .
I can do everything I could before , only faster and more efficiently .
After all was said and done , I essentially used that $ 450 savings to buy 16GB of RAM , TWO Seagate Momentus XT hybrid drives and an OWC upgrade kit to install the second hard drive .
Best Buy Rocks !
It 's fun to take to a bookstore , sit in the coffee shop area , sign in to WiFi and look up book reviews of books I might buy .
I would recomend this acer to parents and grandparents it can really help them in school .
They removed them and returned the computer to me .
I stayed up half the night enjoying my new MacBook Pro .
Have purchased many products over the years from MacConnection and this transaction , like all the others , we smoothly with no problems .
I have n't tried the one with retina display ... Maybe in the future .
Not enough time for me to give it 5 stars !
Very disappointed !
This Macbook Pro is fast , powerful , and runs super quiet and cool .
NO more Lenovo for me .
- got it back 3 months later
Only thing I would want to add to this is an internal bluray read/write drive .
Easy learning curve .
It is light and the battery last a very long time .
It meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling .
It was also cheaper than the Pro which made it even more appealing to me .
But sadly the replacement froze-up while updating the BIOS again and shut down and would not turn back on .
- I propose that they can just swap the hard drives .
I have other computers that get strong signals that do n't drop in places that this " net " book loses its signal .
They said it was a computer error on this type of computer .
I also travel with it and it never gives me any problems .
With a healthy pessimism , I took the machine home and tried to find a flaw .
It 's just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open .
The speed , the simplicity , the design . . it is lightyears ahead of any PC I have ever owned .
It has been plagued with problems since the day i turned it on .
I am not sure if it was the drive itself , however ;
I get a ton of compliments on its size , and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus , I can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you 're restricted to the width of your body for computing room .
I love a " pc " but I was ready for a change and tired of the windows system .
Just a month and a half or two months ago , my VAIO crashed again .
The screen , the software and the smoothness of the operating system .
I love it !
Never been happier using computer .
When it come time for warranty service to Toshiba you do n't matter .
This computer was bought because I wanted " top of the line " , fast , reliable , HA .
It started out getting hot after only a few months .
another satisfied customer .
I had this computer for one month and had to send it in for repair .
I need graphic power to run my Adobe Creative apps efficiently .
Macs are designed for the " frontal lobe challenged " people out there .
I 've had a Toshiba laptop in the past ;
I have had it over a year now with out a Glitch of any kind . . I love the lit up keys and screen display ... this thing is Fast and clear as can be .
This mac has been a problem since we got it .
So if you want a good machine that does almost anything this is the one , if you want a low budget computer then look at the other great brands Best Buy sells .
It has been nothing but trouble from the time we bought it .
The local computer repair shops send out ads that say along the lines of we can fix almost any problem or computer usually even the trouble some Toshiba satellite .
The Internet Explorer was very slow from the very beginning .
I went to my local Best Buy looking for a new laptop since mine broke .
I was n't a big fan of the Netbooks but this one was very well designed .
The Macbook Pro is the premier choice for college students .
I have used different laptops in the past and I have to rate this one way above the rest .
2nd Mac book I have purchased from MacConnection .
You will regret it if you buy any dell .
Wonderful sleek case design is only on the outside .
Overall , this is a wonderful computer and definitly worth the purchase !
! so nice . . stable . . fast . . now i got my SSD !
I am please with the products ease of use ; out of the box ready ; appearance and functionality .
First of all , I 've been Dell fan for more than fifteen years .
Great pick for portability and affordability .
apple is one of the best computer companies in the country .
It works exactly like it did the day I took it out of the box .
This is the first macbook I have ever had .
Could not keep up with me and finally the hard drive went out .
For the not so good , I got the stock screen - which is VERY glossy .
Those moments in thime where you want to throw something against the wall ? Yeah , I wanted to throw that lap top out the window and light it on fire .
Received all four in good order ;
I considered I may have too much on the computer , but after looking , there was plenty of space and that is not the issue .
The only solution is to turn the brightness down , etc .
Screen is crystal clear , yes it 's small - but it 's a netbook !
The price and features more than met my needs .
Easy to install also small to leave anywhere at your bedroom also very easy to configure for ADSl cable or wifi .
It should n't happen like that , I do n't have any design app open or anything .
Which is what I did , check out my ACER 5517 !
And at one point , they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when I upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop ( I bought the memory stick they recomended ) .
Other than not being a fan of click pads ( industry standard these days ) and the lousy internal speakers , it 's hard for me to find things about this notebook I do n't like , especially considering the $ 350 price tag .
It allows you to automatically upload photos to your Facebook account with one click .
PLEASE MAKE THESE !
I needed a driver for my HP and they would not help me with out me paying over $ 50 for it .
It is not ideal for children because of the temp .
I feel that enough people have Macs these days and that companies need to start making things more compatable than they used to be .
I do n't know why I did n't make the switch sooner ... o ya because it 's expensive .
Disappointing for such a lovely screen and at a reasonable price
This item is a beautiful piece , it works well , it is easy to carry and handle .
Mac also has many apps and programs that are quite cheap or free .
The built in camera is very useful when chatting with other techs in remote buildings on our campus .
It does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern .
I bought this laptop on Saturday and am completely in love with it !
Still trying to learn how to use it .
Pairing it with an iPhone is a pure pleasure - talk about painless syncing - used to take me forever - now it 's a snap .
This laptop looks great on the surface : 17 " inch screen , good price-point , nice appearance , boots up quickly , runs fast etc .
I have no idea how to burn cd 's or to use the web cam , just for starters .
My Mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary .
The product is prefect for everyone .
falls into the case .
After 20-30 min the screen of the notebook switched off .
Meets my needs perfectly and is light enough for this senior to carry without affecting my arthritis .
There is a little indent to help open it - but good luck with that .
I am very pleased with my purchase !
At first , the computer seemed a great deal -- seemingly high-end specs for a low , low price .
It 's a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them .
Acer has set me up with FREE recovery discs , when they are available since I asked .
I have been PC for years but this computer is intuitive and its built in features are a great help
I am replacing the HD with a Micron SSD soon .
I have had the luxury ( sarcasm ) of owning 2 of these laptops .
Just be careful ; you always have to give up some good stuff for others .
I shipped out on Saturday , July 17 .
They click .
It pretty much does everything we could ever need , and looks great to boot .
The only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets , and rather quickly too .
The DVD burner broke after burning 3 DVD 'd during that time !
( I had been a Windows/Linux user before this ) I love the size because the screen is big enough for what I use it for ( Internet , artwork ) , and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable .
When I got this laptop in 2007 to help me with school , I had a hard time from beginning .
They freeze all the time .
My first laptop was an Acer that I got for Christmas .
Its also FUN to use !
It is easy to use , fast and has great graphics for the money .
The video card is great for media , and above average for gaming , but not a gamers first choice .
Would HIGHLY recommend this netbook though .
Needs a CD/DVD drive and a bigger power switch .
That includes transferring my music and movies .
I Contacted HP about this situation and was given excuses , without results .
No luck , although I waited for hours on the phone-Visited MacHouse , they stated the their call center is down due to too many phonecalls ( difficult to believe ) .
Was not happy with one of the programs on it .
Got this for a graduation gift for my daughter for her to use at college .
When I took it back to Best Buy I asked them if they were seriously trying to drive me insane !
It 's not a wear-and-tear issue , not due to user carelessness and most importantly , they CA N'T guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and I have to accept the outcome .
I recently purchased the mini and absolutely love it !
It is easy to use and lightweight .
It 's a great prodcut to handle basic computing needs .
Eventually my battery would n't charge , so unless I had it plugged in it would n't even power on .
I looked at the computer and it said updating but the asked for a product key .
but other then that I would give this product a 4 in hafe stars .
Ok first .
Runs good and does the job , ca n't complain about that !
The benefits were immediate !
What a great little laptop .
It doesnt get hot like my PC , with technology always at the tip of our fingertips anytime I forget how to do something i just google it .
A seventy dollar mouse !
I am most impressed with the programming , including the iPhoto .
It was wonderful deal for the wonderful product .
The lcd screen stopped working on mine after 10 months .
Could n't keep a page up you were working on !
Buy this .
Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another , and I am not kidding you , I called different hours of the day and you 'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again , since they make it sound like they do n't have your history list of your calls right in front of them .
believe me apple has a reputation .
Dell sucks
Starts up in a hurry and everything is ready to go .
Everything I wanted and everything I needed and the price was great !
The Mac Mini is probably the simplest example of compact computing out there .
I ca n't even remember how I finally got it taken care of , but I was done with Sony after that !
So , I thought why not give Mac Book pro a try .
The sheer power and flexibility makes the MacBook Pro a must have for any techie !
It was still working , but there was nothing on the screen .
It 's a great product for a great price !
Reason why ? It 's because when you buy it , you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that laptop , the price will stay the same for the next year , and even if Apple does decides to change mode , your laptop value will only drop 10-20 % , unlike PC laptops which drop more than 80 % .
Also the speakers are not very loud , But it is a netbook .
This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components , and I 'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator , but I still expected better product quality for this price range .
my niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that does n't require a dedicated video card .
the volume is really low to low for a laptopwas not expectin t volume to be so lowan i hate that about this computer
Besides , the apple stocks have been falling due to lack of sales .
The love part of my relationship with this laptop does n't take very long .
The price is higher than most lab top out there ; however , he/she will get what they paid for , which is a great computer .
i tried turning it done but it did nothing .
The software is amazing .
It started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it was plugged in ( mousing over the battery icon would read , for example , " 74 % , plugged in , not charging " ) , requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge .
Which was way too much money .
Features like the font are very block-like and old school .
It 's been time for a new laptop , and the only debate was which size of the Mac laptops , and whether to spring for the retina display .
The switchable graphic card is pretty sweet when you want gaming on the laptop .
I work as a designer and coder and I needed a new buddy to work with , not gaming .
You just lose a customer .
wonderful features .
NOT WITH APPLE .
Again , decent comp for the price , and I was in need of one quickly as my other laptop died on me .
So think about factoring those things in when you purchase .
The track pad is a bit squirrely at times - sometimes too sensitive , and sometimes a bit unresponsive , but it 's usable .
It 's a bummer and one out of five is being kind .
But after using it a couple of weeks , the overall operation is poor .
It bluescreened on me without any warning , running simply basic Chrome .
Seems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications ( ie Internet tabs , programs , etc ) simultaneously .
The sound is a bit quiet if you 're on a plane , this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones .
I have never had an experience like this .
I ordered through MacMall , which saved me the sales tax I would have incurred buying locally .
Images are crisp and clean .
It will be returned in the state to which it was shipped Michigan .
Its ease of use and the top service from Apple - be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar - can not be beat .
Great laptop that offers many great features !
Do n't waste your money or time .
I like the design and ease of use with the keyboard , plenty of ports .
Newegg 's RMA service was great as always , I contacted them late Friday night , and they issued me an RMA number and a PrePaid UPS shipping label the very next morning on Saturday .
The Apple MC371LL/A 2.4 Ghz 15.4-inch MacBook Pro Notebook is a horrible waste of money .
The resolution on the screen is almost pure HD .
Clear picture on it and everything .
its not bad just VERY VERY annoying .
With no problems , I 'm happy with this purchase because I saved money compared to buying it anywhere else .
It is easy to use , has great screen quality , and every so light weight .
I would not recommend this product to anyone .
I love this program , it is superior to windows movie maker .
You know what ? I happened to buy a defective blood pressure monitor a week ago at the Bukit Batok Polyclinic NHG Pharmacy a week ago .
Just a black screen !
Quite simply this is the best laptop I have ever owned .
I was really happy because it is a much better price on amazon.com than it was in the Mac store .
I blame the Mac OS .
Boot-up slowed significantly after all Windows updates were installed .
I do n't have that additional money right now , and therefore would n't have purchased it at this time .
It was a hard decision for me since the MacBook Pro looked so appealing .
I used to build my own desktops from the component parts , and recently my 7 year old Pentium 4 with HT 1 GB ram SATA desktop stopped working ( this was a rock star 7 years ago ) .
but it came back in even worse shape .
If you already own a 2009 , 2010 , or early 2011 model , you should wait until the next update .
I only wish this mac had a CD/DVD player built in .
The screen takes some getting use to , because it is smaller than the laptop .
The SuperDrive is quiet .
When i finally held it in my hands i kissed it , yes i did .
little short on RAM but you get what you pay for .
A MONTH LATER , we reinstall the OS ( Vista ) .
When this happened I would have to completely power off my computer and restart it .
they had to replace the motherboard in April
I will never go back to a PC again !
After the first few months , the computer started crashing about every week .
When we bought our new HP comouter in Dec. of 2008 , we wanted Windows XP , but were told it would cost an extra $ 159 , so we went with Vista .
The large screen also helps when you are working in design based programs like Adobe Creative Suite .
I feel that it was poorly put together , because once in a while different plastic pieces would come off of it .
However , you have to adjust yourself to what it will do , not what you want it to do .
I have three words : Piece of Junk !
However , I can refute that OSX is " FAST " .
After replacing the spinning hard disk with an ssd drive , my mac is just flying .
Being a tech savvy , APPLE - product loving person , I 'm glad I finally got the MacBook Pro !
Also , I issued a replacement RMA for a few dead pixels in the upper zone of the screen , which is noticable to me .
My hp G60-244dx died after only 16 months .
They are n't worth the money , even though they are on the cheap side , laptop speaking .
Bought with a credit card .
Sad very SAD .
I occassionaly use it for work via VPN and it has not given me any problems .
The difference in the Apple keyboard from a PC 's keyboard took a bit of tim to get used to , but overall it 's worth it !
The magnetic plug-in power charging power cord is great ( I even put it to the test by accident ) - excellent innovation !
I could not handle it one hand like I can the replacement computer I purchased .
Keyboard good sized and wasy to use .
I have had no luck with staples or HP to resolve this problem .
It was weird .
they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem .
I have had it for almost four years now and I have only had a few problems with it .
It looks and feels solid , with a flawless finish .
I think this ps was manufactured in the mid 90 's .
and looks very sexyy :D really the mac book pro is the best laptop specially for students in college if you are not caring about price .
Unfortunately , that is not the case .
I was a little concerned about the touch pad based on reviews , but I 've found it fine to work with .
It 's even easy to hook up to other wireless networks .
I mainly use it for email , internet , and managing personal files ( pics , vids , etc. ) .
My ONLY issues are : 1 ) the screen/video resolution wo n't increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60
It 's macbook pro and there is no discusion about it .
My laptop with Windows 7 crashed and I did not want Windows 8 .
All the problems I have had with PC 's are solved with a Mac : the issue of overheating-my Dell was always overheating and not working properly or simply shutting off , and the issue of viruses and contaminants-my HP completely quit working within2 years of purchasing it , with no inexpensive way of fixing it .
So far , I have no complaints .
PC users work in Word , while Mac users work in Pages .
LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT !
After talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate , I chose the MacBook Pro over the white MacBook .
I am pleased with the fast log on , speedy WiFi connection and the long battery life ( > 6 hrs ) .
Let me tell you , this machine is great .
I 'm overall pleased with the interface and the portability of this product .
Sony , Acer , Dell , Packard Bell and Toshiba .
Since I have always used Apple products , the choice of Macbook Pro was obvious .
But I do n't see it as a problem .
They were able to set-up with labtops themselves within a few minutes .
The receiver was full of superlatives for the quality and performance .
It 's more expensive but well worth it in the long run .
Of course , I also have several great software packages that came for free including iWork , GarageBand , and iMovie .
I am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great !
It did fairly well , other than it 's poor performance , overheating and occational blue screen .
Still , this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work .
air has higher resolution but the fonts are small .
Please , anyone who is considering getting this computer , stop .
That is pretty sad when they name them specifically .
The battery holds up well , it 's built very solidly , and runs fast .
Would like more trendy , high tech features .
Currently if I use the laptop I ca n't sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs .
Long story short , since I experience so many problems with my laptop every since I bought it from day one , I did n't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what I pay for a crapy laptop , but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year , they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services , they finally gave in .
That is how it is able to function better than any other PC .
Mac tutorials do help .
The internet capabilities are also very strong and picks up signals very easily .
Not worth it one bit .
the latest version does not have a disc drive .
Its fast , has High definition quality in the videos .
I 've had my MacBook Pro for three years now and still love it !
Who could n't love a DVD burner , 80-gigabyte HD , and fairly new graphics chip ? As I soon discovered , though , there is a reason for which similarly-configured Sony and Toshiba machines cost more : they use higher-quality components that are faster , better-configured , and end up lasting a lot longer .
I 'm so disgusted that I wasted my money on this product .
Another Great thing is the Beast graphics .
Oh yea , has no numeric pad on the side .
- Estimated time to fix it : 10 working days or less .
Well designed and fast .
Again I sent it back and they replaced the motherboard and some fan inside .
This is my first LG product .
While the computer seems to be set up in a common sense way rather than in geek-speak , there are certain quirks that can drive you crazy trying to deal with the PC world .
I 've saved a lot of time and headaches so far , using my new MacBook Pro .
I 'm using this computer for word processing , web browsing , some gaming , and I 'm learning programming .
Screen , keyboard , and mouse : If you cant see yourself spending the extra money to jump up to a Mac the beautiful screen , responsive island backlit keyboard , and fun multi-touch mouse is worth the extra money to me alone .
Also the display is exceptional !
There are several programs for school or office use ( Pages , Numbers , Keynote , etc. ) , music ( Garageband ) , photo management ( Photo Booth , iPhoto ) , video-editing or movie-making ( iMovie ) , etc .
HOW DOES THE POWER SUPPLY NOT WORK !!!
On two occasions the computer s calendar told me it was 1969 .
10 plus hours of battery ...
I previously owned an HP desktop and a Dell laptop .
I would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of grabage .
It would take up too much time to do reaearch for my papers and I would be up hours-just because the computer was too slow .
So if anyones looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name TOSHIBA on it ...
More likely it will require replacing the logic board once they admit they have a problem and come up with a solution .
WIth the upgraded memory , the MacBook Pro never has an issue running many many applications at once !
The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely .
The Hewitt Packard Pavillion dv6700 was my first laptop , before this I had a Dell desktop that I loved .
The battery life is amazingly long at 7hrs and 5hrs if you use it .
I would recommend to any one lloking for a first class computer !
I like those programs better than Office and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the Office programs as well .
I got the new adapter and there was no change .
But Sony said we could send it back and be charged for adding the bluetooth an additional seventy something dollars .
They would repair one thing , send it back and it would still have the same problem .
No laptop is perfect , but sometimes you just find a computer that works for you .
Love that it does n't take up space like a regular computer .
It is EXTREMELY fast and never lags .
They are so realistic I am just speechless .
This laptop rocks ( only wish it could run SolidWorks CAD - which Apple does n't support ) !
The keyboard feels good and I type just fine on it .
I did swap out the hard drive for a Samsung 830 SSD which I highly recommend .
Its the best , its got the looks , super easy to use and love all you can do with the trackpad ! . .
Couldnt not use it .
the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have .
The graphics were awful and the warranty is n't even worth the cheap payment on the computer .
HELP , HELP , OTHER THAN THAT GETS A GREAT LITTLE WONDER .
The computer did what it was NOT supposed to do , and I did n't know what to do ....
I BOUGHT THIS LAP TOP AND THE CHARGE TIME DOSE N'T LAST AS LONG AS THEY SAY IT WILL MORE LIKE 2 HOURS
Clearly , there is something wrong with the product and LG did n't take up the responsibility .
however , I may have inadvertently thrown out one of the batteries with the shipping carton .
It is small enough to fit in one of my purses !
It has many great programs , such as ILife , iPhotos and others .
I also love the small , convenient size of my laptop , making it a perfect tool for my academic studies .
It is so speedy .
It was truly a great computer costing less than one thousand bucks before tax .

Overall the computer is very easy to use , the screen is perfect , great computer , my daughter loves .
You can even run a parallels type program easily and run any leftover PC software that you absolutely can not be without .
In the shop , these MacBooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure - so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it , get it home , break the seal and use it ( very clever con ) .
Screen is crystal clear and the system is very responsive .
I have owned at least 4 to 5 laptops and computers - but this is by far the most superior machine I have ever owned .
It was also suffering from hardware ( keyboard ) issues , relatively slow performance and shortening battery lifetime .
in May I started having problems with the USB ports not working .
If you start on the far right side and scroll to your left the start menu will automatically come up .
Not good for a person who gets online daily .
The troubleshooting said it was the AC adaptor so we ordered a new one .
* 4 weeks after giving the computer for repair * - Annoyed at MacHouse Amsterdam , decided to send complaint email to Apple .
I 'm going to try and keep my old G4 on the road for as long as possible .
I would say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful .
This was an update from an early MacBook Pro .
I 've have n't had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off .
They claim call center is still down .
No Cd Rom in the new version there 's no way I 'm spending that kind of money on something has less features than the older version .
No startup disk was not included but that may be my fault .
The perfect notebook ...
The machine is speedy and efficient .
I needed a laptop with big storage , a nice screen and fast so I can photoshop without any problem .
I have had a Mac for 6 years and wo n't go back to PC .
This thing is awesome , everything always works , everything is always easy to set up , everything is compatible , its literally everything I could ask for .
I decided I wanted a laptop so I went into the BBY store .
- Complied to their protocol , called number , made " case " , got an email address to send complaint .
I was looking for something in between a regular laptop and a tablet and this is it .
I will have to say that I love my MacBook Pro !
Have returned that laptop unused .
They have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and I 'm looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular .
Does everything I wanted this laptop to do .
Just beware no DVD slot so when I went to install software I had on CD I could n't .
the laptop was really good and it goes really fast just the way i thought it would of run .
excellent in every way .
Still pretty pricey , but I 've been putting off money for a while as a little Macbook Fund , and finally got to use it .
AND the best part is that it even comes with a free printer ( when they have a certain promotion/offer going , of course ) !
So noise is reduced at least 50 % and the heat is much better , now it does n't feel hot but warm .
I would like to tell you about the best laptop I just got from Mac .
The rep did not even answer my question , I had to ask him , if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he did n't even try to acknowledge my question .
It is the worst laptop ever
I just love my Mac !
I am loyal to Apple .
This is a great computer .
I paid about 18000 for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me .
It has a very high performance , just for what I needed for .
The computer was two weeks late in delivery because HP forgot to complete the required import paperwork .
Obviously , this Macbook is P-E-R-F-E-C-T for me because it does exactly what I need in an easy-to-function way .
I really wanted a Mac over a pc because I used a Mac in high school .
It is always reliable , never bugged and responds well .
No machine has come remotely close to causing as many problems .
I have had a black macbook since 2007 .
The only pro to this computer is it was under $ 600 !
was a great deal i will give that .
A cheaper price should not equal a " cheap " product .
Summary : Spend your money elsewhere
It took several weeks just to get them to acknowledge that I owned the warranty .
They offer the best warranty in the business , and do n't 3rd party it out like Toshiba .
The battery has never worked well .
Very very disappointed !
the only thing that bums me out about this purchase is they released a newer updated mbp seriously RIGHT after i bought this one .
Do not purchase this laptop .
All of the programs ( Keynote , Pages , Numbers ) have an option to save your documents as Microsoft compatible , which really eliminates the need for the actual .
I paid for a new laptop , but was sent a used one .
Crisp screen , great battery life , and plenty of storage .
Right size and weight for portability .
I always swore by PCs and would never consider a MAC .
Excellent product for the money .
Was very much worth the price i paid .
She told me flatly , " It 's like that one .
Again in February my computer completely failed to the point that it could not load Windows so I contacted Acer to get it fixed thru my Warrenty and it took about 3 days fighting on the phone with agents and it seemed as though NONE of them spoke English .
Anyone who is considering buying an Acer computer of any sort , I seriously suggest you look into buying a different brand .
I would have given it 5 starts was it not for the fact that it had Windows 8
The computer is currently in West Verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by Toshiba .
PC never worked right even after BIOS fixed .
I understand I should call Apple Tech Support about any variables ( which is my purpose of writing this con ) as variables could be a bigger future problem .
But if you ca n't make your product last more than a year , you will not get my business again .
while about 8 years ago , I hope that the quality has changed .
I was disappointed when I realized that the keyboard does n't light up on this model .
i love the keyboard and the screen .
Finally set the unit back to HP after a month of hell .
Not to mention , the battery life is absolutely amazing .
Even so , I like playing online games , so it was wonderful that there is a feature where I can dualboot Windows .
With in weeks of purchasing my computer is began to slow down .
5 months dead again .
That 's very possible , but since they do n't make Windows XP drivers for the sound card in this machine , I was stuck until Windows 7 came out .
3 weeks went by and the computer keeps crashing and will not open any applications .
But as time went on I found it almost impossible to keep the thing on-line through wi-fi .
They do n't seem to be susceptible to viruses , which is one less big thing to worry about when it comes to computers .
Has met or exceeded my needs for a compact travel device .
My son and his family have a hard time financially because he is self-employed so the family had no computer of any kind , and kyle the oldest child is 12 and really need something to help him in school .
The programs are great , like iphoto ( love the editing capabilities ) , imail ( which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad ) , imovie , etc .
Waited on getting this computer , but it has been a great change .
The sound is nice and loud ; I do n't have any problems with hearing anything .
Best Buy laughed when I told them they should replace it instead of expecting me to be without a computer again for another couple of weeks .
So much faster and sleeker looking .
Very Very Highly Recommended .
I did n't want to buy a generic brand computer but it is really nice .
There is nothing to complain about the system .
This purchase opened me to the world of Macbooks , and I am impressed with the intuition of the design , the beauty of the product , and the excellent technological advances associated with it .
I really do n't like it , but I am stuck .
But guess what ? ( you have to buy an external dvd drive it does n't have a built in type ) The notebook ca n't be used because it does n't read anything for an external drive .
There is a backlit keyboard which is perfect for typing in the dark .
Returned laptop for a 4th repair and it came back but now would lock up and randomly reboot frequently making the laptop unusable .
It 's so bad that I 'm thinking I only got half a battery or something .
I lost two items I was working on until I figured out what was happening .
Microsoft seems to be unable to keep up with repairs for the multitude of windows problems .
She said Wal Mart rants and raves abouy carring Dell because it 's a big name but they are a piece of garbage .
:) In the past four years I 've had it I have never once gotten a virus .
It is made of such solid construction and since I have never had a Mac using my iPhone helped me get used to the system a bit .
I would definitely suggest this laptop !
Returned laptop for repair a 2nd time and it came back with obvious physical damage ( keyboard bulging and speaker grill pressed in ) , buttons not working and USB ports inoperative .
Extremely disappointed with the way it is .
BEST BUY - 5 STARS + + + ( sales , service , respect for old men who are n't familiar with the technology ) DELL COMPUTERS - 3 stars DELL SUPPORT - owes a me a couple
I do n't want to RUN a computer ; I want to USE a computer .
Quality Display I was surprised with the performance and quality of this HP Laptop .
I have the A65 - right now it 's a paperweight .
It 's also fairly easy to use the Operating System .
Enjoy that Toshib force and durability unparalleled
Thank God for " ctrl Z " Bottom line , I 've been using laptops since the mid 90s and probably the majority of brands out there .
With today 's company fighting over marketshare , its a shame that ASUS can get away with the inept staff answering thephone .
While I mostly use it for email , internet and gaming , I 'm confident all other applications live up to the high standard I 've come to appreciate from Mac laptops .
Also , one of the users mentioned how the edges on the macbook is sharp , if you have money to spend on one of the incase shells , it does n't seem to be a problem .
I love the multi-touch trackpad .
And I can attach my projector to it .
After 5 months of failed repairs , requested a full refund but was refused and it still is not repaired and Acer is indifferent to the issue .
I have n't used it for anything high tech yet , but I love it already .
Startup in about 30 seconds , shutdown in 2-4 seconds , resume from sleep in 0-2 seconds .
It 's been a couple weeks since the purchase and I 'm struggle with finding the correct keys ( but that was expected ) .
I now travel with this laptop and my work PC .
The casing of the power cord fried and shocked my husband when he pulled it out of the socket .
I am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook , it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop .
The memory was gone and it was not able to be used .
I respond that I do not have the old computer and this way I would lose the data on my hard drive .
The aluminum body sure makes it stand out .
This is something i would deffinately reccomend to someone .
After using it for over a month , an issue started to surface .
The store honored their warrenty and made the comment that they do n't even recommend the HP brand because of the problems with their warrentys .
Words can not express how much I love my new Mac .
It is so much easier to use
The screen is n't huge , but that does n't matter when I output media to the 50 inch LCD TV .
A mac is very easy to use and it simply makes sense .
I will never complain about the price since I believe you get what you pay for and my MacBook Pro was worth every dollar .
I would buy it again in a heartbeat !
Called tech support and got the usual Acer " We do n't support software but for $ $ $ we can help you " I explained there was no software involved in booting .
That being said , it still runs video in full screen decently .
I got what I paid for .
Apple continues to shine and provide a much more enjoyable computer experience !
Yet my mac continues to function properly .
I was a little worry at first because I do n't have a lot of experience with os.x and windows has always been second nature to me after many years of using windows .
I hate it !
True quality at a great price !
It all just makes sense .
My laptop now has no battery .
The size is perfect and I do not recomend anything bigger except for any person who can exceed the limited space it gives you .
Made interneting ( part of my business ) very difficult to maintain .
This computer is absolutely AMAZING !!!
Even though it is running Snow Leopard , 2.4 GHz C2D is a bit of an antiquated CPU and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running Office Mac applications such as Word or Excel .
Even though the computer is larger they did not make the keyboard larger .
The online tutorial videos make it super easy to learn if you have always used a PC .
- they lost my laptop for a month
The price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop .
I had to have these computers in my school .
All you have to do is turn it on and it works .
Took that one home , same thing .
The unibody design is edgy and durable .
They did n't even try to assist me or even offer a replacement .
Before , I reloaded with Windows 7 Ultimate and used only the downloaded drivers from Acer 's site .
The technical support was not helpful as well .
I never had this kind of quality issue with Dell ( not to say Dell is that great ) , not with a brand new laptop .
the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happeneing so hopefully we can get a new one very soon !
I am glad I did my research .
Some days it 's just blurry , some days it appears that it 's raining on my nice desktop background of a lake and mountains .
The screen almost looked like a barcode when it froze .
( The SATA controller is the motherboard chip that lets the CPU talk to the hard drive . )
Very fast for my needs .
The laptop was very easy to set up .
Enjoy using Microsoft Office !
Garageband is more for the musicians , and the laptop is equipped with a good working microphone , good enough for beginners and musicians at the intermediate level .
First the screen goes completely out .
It is meant to be PORTABLE .
After the warrenty expired the hard drive went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace .
This netbook went bad on me after 3 days .
I took the computer back in yet again except this time they kept it to send into their Geek Squad headquarters .
YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TALK TO AN AMERICAN WARRANTY SERVICE IS OUT OF COUNTRY .
I do everything on this computer - check email , facebook , shop , check blogs , write papers , listen to music , and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv .
I am not much of a computer techie , so I can understand some of the internal problems , though I do have trend micro as an antiviral program .
I work in film editing and post production , so I need a laptop that not only has power , but memory and speed as well .
My first problem was with the pre-loaded Norton Firewall/Security program .
It 's A MAC !!
Windows XP SP2 caused many problems on the computer , so I had to remove it .
The AMD Turin processor seems to always perform so much better than Intel .
It 's a joke .
It is good to know that I can mobilize without having to worry about the battery life .
It 's great to have a solid Mac in the living room .
I went to Toshiba online help and found some suggestions to fix it .
It has plenty of memory , lots of hard drive , and great graphics .
With all the programs that came with it , such as iLife and iWork , I was set from the very beginning .
I have had no problems with it unlike some hardware defects on past models .
EITHER WAY , THE KEYBOARD IS UNSATISFACTORY .
Excellent LED monitor and well equipped .
1 ) Payed $ 2200 for a " premium " laptop
Simple to use , and great graphics .
Each time taking about 1 day or so .
I am just ONE of the million customers .
OSX Lion is a great performer . . extremely fast and reliable .
If only Bill Gates would read some of what is said here MS would do a better job .
Overall very impressed , Thank you Apple and Amazon !
I am not happy with my purchase
It 's a lottery at this point as I have read that other have received new ones with the same problem .
I would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about .
The screen is very large and crystal clear with amazing colors and resolution .
The only thing I would change about it is the mouse keys .
It took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back .
It is , however , very heavy .
It does not even have the software to play a dvd now .
What angers me more than anything else is that I spent all those years hating MACs when I could have been getting a lot more production with a whole lot less grief !
You might think , I am new in this game , but I am a gadget lover , and have had more than 2 dozens laptops in the past 15 years , and none gets this hot , that fast .
The extended warranty for the $ 4000 and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu .
As for the laptop , this is our 3rd Apple computer in the past 2 years .
I fell in love with my machine , and it was pampered .
Luckily , Dell said they would replace my laptop with a new one , but instead I got a refund and bought a mac .
This worked just fine .
This is another reason to like the Mac .
Once again , I was told it was the suspicious power supply problem .
Im glad that it has such great features in it .
I have had nothing but problems since the day I took it out of the box !
Good monitor and performed well .
It allows me to do everything I need from a computer and more .
This is my second laptop , and it is head and shoulders above my first .
I can actually get work done with this MAC , and not fight with it like my tired old PC laptop .
Okay , let 's just start out by saying I am in no way a computer techy .
My sister is the electronics manager at Wal Mart and she says that HP is the best .
Although my model was listed as recalled , HP denied my claim .
Those things are very important - vital even !
I also had a problem with the touchpad that caused the mouse pointer to jump all over the screen .
Loaded with bloatware .
This is basically the best laptop I have ever had or used .
The speed is incredible and I am more than satisfied .
I 've only had it one day , but I really do love it and I 'm happy it was economical and I 'm finally able to own a Mac !
" Then I proceed to tell her that I checked out other retail stores that carry the netbook and it was n't LIKE THAT .
The display is incredibly bright , much brighter than my PowerBook and very crisp .
If upgrade is possible to the full Windows 7 , then I will truly be a very happy geek .
Just what the doctor ordered .
Should be there by the end of the week ( again ... ) .
Great wifi too .
Screen is a bit glossy , but that 's not too bad .
It runs perfectly .
it is the worst computer dell ever made .
The Toshiba Satellite laptop is DESIGNED to fail !
I really like the size and I 'm a fan of the ACERS .
The processor a AMD Semprom at 2.1 ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for HD or heavy computing .
I would tell the technician I knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and I had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me I needed to send the computer in .
I use it now more than I even thought I would .
Great , quick laptop for the money .
The screen is bright and clear , the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice .
Whenever I call Dell about an unrelated problem , they ask me if my laptop is running slowly and if I 'd like to purchase more memory for $ 75 .
I simply got tired of a bad computer like windows with its constant freezing and anti-virus .
Overall : Poor , Features : Average , Performance : Poor , Battery Life : Excellent , Price-Value : Poor
I shopped around before buying .
My MacBook is faster than any comparable PC .
i would have to say that overall its great !
It is very durable , I am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet .
I will definitely be getting a new laptop if it has any more issues after the warranty expires and researching carefully when I do so I do n't run accross a situation like this again !
Product support very poor as each phone call costs me long distan
It 's perfect for everything and runs faster than an average pc !
The video chat is the only thing that is iffy about it but im sure once they unpdate the next version on the macbook book the quality of it will be better .
I visited the Apple Store and was impressed with the 17-inch MacBook Pro .
Returning this as soon as I get out of work
I should have checked this before I installed my applications .
Have n't regretted it one bit .
So if you move laptop a lot , it might get loose , however it sits pretty tightly .
without having to have extra equipment and/or complicated routes to take to be able to do so .
Nothing wrong with this computer at all !
They sent out a Sony ' Certified ' technician .
I 'm already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown .
Actually , I had noticed the one on the sales floor also did n't have sound !
Charger seems large for this class of computer .
I was so excited when my dad said i could get a new laptop for my birthday .
Gradually the freezing screen evolved into a screen that froze in weird shapes .
Apparently there is a manufacturing defect , something with the amount of thermal paste .
We were occasional Mac users before , but most recently owned a budget PC since it is what we could afford .
The Apple team also assists you very nicely when choosing which computer is right for you : )
The MAC Mini , wireless keyboard / mouse and a HDMI cable is all I need to get some real work done .
There were no scratches or dents or any marks at all .
They say that this will invalidate the warranty on the hard drive ( I do n't really understand why but anyway ) .
it has had some problems .
If you are looking for something reliable , this is the laptop for you .
I especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems !
This is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine ;
At first it 's like you 're in that honeymoon stage with your laptop .
i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus .
Out of the box I noticed how small it was and was exactly what I was looking for .
I spent alot of money on this product and its been a nightmare .
I would not recommend this to anyone wanting a notebook expecting the performance of a Desktop it does not meet the expectations .
Only issue is that it is a little slow , and I 'm fixing that by adding more RAM .
pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were .
Great deal on an amazing lap top !
Despite the inconvenient weight , I opted for the 12 cell battery .
Hope this helped !
The Toshiba laptop was a great purchase .
Also , HDD secures inside using rails , and there is only one set on the main hard drive .
I or my dad paid over twenty four hundred dollars for everything .
The apple care has never failed me , and I expect it to be the same for this computer as well .
I would say that 85 % of the design industry is Mac for good reason .
The screen shows great colors .
After years of occasionally pulling my hair out fighting computer viruses , a good friend convinced me it was time to go the Apple route .
There is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle , and when I click on it it says : " Consider replacing your battery " and it does not hold full charge .
I got the first " Blue screen of death " in the early part of July .
But , Mac makes the switch from PC to Mac easy .
CONS : Price is a bit ridiculous , kinda heavy .
- When battery life went to 4 hours or less , took it to the MacHouse Amsterdam for repair ( 26th of August ) .
Amazing Performance for anything I throw at it .
He loves it and it is easy to use and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started .
It super shiny , so you can see the fingerprints easily .
The battery life is also relatively good .
One night I turned the freaking thing off after using it , the next day I turn it on , no GUI , screen all dark , power light steady , hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does .
The only bad part is the size/weight .
The Notebook PC , Toshiba Qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me .
I would never tell anyone to buy one either .
Being a PC user for many years to switch to a Mac I will not go back .
I can never go back to a PC now , this machine never freezes or has any problems .
It doesnt overheat or make any loud noises .
Overall , still a very nice machine .
Buy it , love it , and I promise you wo n't regret it .
I wish iWork or MS Office came with the Mac , but MS Office does n't even come with most pc laptops .
I am going to go back and return at Store I bought from !
Cheaper than buying it @ apple too !
Info : Windows failed to load because the kernal is missing , or corrupt .
The audio volume is quite low and virtually unusable in a room with any background activity .
You will need them if you want to reload the OS ( I recommend doing if you can to start fresh and optimal ) .
the mcbook pro notebook will make it easy for you to write and read your emails at blazing speeds .
I do admit it is pricey but the saying is really true with this MacBook Pro Laptop ( You get what you pay for ) .
The Macbook is also made better , my computer has never got a virus , and the laptop runs just as fast as the first day I bought it .
It is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed .
Its perfect , not much heavy .
I did a lot of research and ended up thinking this Toshiba was the best one for me .
Laptop is advertised as a 15 " but the casing looks like that of a 17 " .
Also stunning colors and speedy
We also use Paralles so we can run virtual machines of Windows XP Professional , Windows 7 Home Premium , Windows Server Enterprise 2003 , and Windows Server 2008 Enterprise .
I look forward to years of use , it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well .
I will also say it is much better than I expected !
I wish I would have taken the plunge years ago .
My laptop worked again for just a while before I started having issues AGAIN .
not the day received .
The OS is fast and fluid , everything is organized and it 's just beautiful .
the i3 processor does n't seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on .
SO ? HOW CAN YOU SOLVE IT ? C'mon , I just bought the netbook 2 weeks ago .
Second , it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated
Not working = bad
Great purchase and I definitely did n't miss out on the Black Friday deals .
I also experience the same with my MacBook Air .
I 'm glad I made the choice to switch and buy this MAC .
Do you think the shop will give me a new set ?? It will NOT !
Instead it is sitting in West Verginia waiting for UPS to take two days to send Me a box and Two days for them to ship the computer some 691 miles by air ? to Louisville Ky .
There are no viruses or spyware to worry about like on a Windows computer .
- They reported that the computer is in their headquarters .
And windows 7 works like a charm .
His was worth $ 36 .
Buying a Mac Mini would allow me to make the transition .
I would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an easy to use , stylish , fun , awesome computer .
I 've always used PC 's for work home and this is my first experience with a Mac .
I charge it at night and skip taking the cord with me because of the good battery life .
The 13 " MacBook Pro is portable , durable , and very capable .
What 's also interesting is this survey changed my ratings the first time I submitted it in case it does n't keep what I put here are my aratings
It 's so quick and responsive that it makes working/surfing on a computer so much more pleasurable !
Not a bad laptop , it 's a bit slow , but gets the job done .
I love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention PC 's require .
A key contributor that led me to Mac is the art aspect .
The laptop is gorgeous .
It 's slow and one day i hope to have the money to get rid of it and buy something else .
I 'm really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer .
When my Dell laptop gave up only after 2 1/2 years , I decided to buy MacBook Pro .
I returned the 2nd laptop for a full refund .
As a die-hard Windows enthusiast , I shunned the idea of a Mac until this point .
Since I 've had this computer I 've only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth .
My MacBook Pro works like a dream , it has never overheated , or even been slightly warm for that matter .
That being said after 2 weeks of owning every time I start it up now it gives me a black screen for 5-8 seconds stating pxe-e61 media test error check cable .
I had to pay for the shipping !
It 's so nice to look at and the keys are easy to type with .
Consumer Report recommended Toshiba .
There is no need to open a program first and the cliick open or import .
The ease of use is wonderful .
Everything was up and running within 15 minutes of unboxing .
After much battling with HP i was able to return it 4 times for repairs .
So this was great for me .
Strong build though which really adds to its durability .
My main reason to convert was the imovie program .
I 'm very impressed .
I play a lot of casual games online , and the touchpad is very responsive .
Save your money and go for a better device .
It is very fast and has everything that I need except for a word program .
I am having a friend look at it , but will probably return it .
Sony parts reliability and quality of service is recenlty the worst .
A great college tool !
I have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing .
I 've had this laptop for about a month now .
As a lifelong Windows user , I was extremely pleased to make the change to Mac .
Buy the Mac Mini it 's a terribly great machine .
this is quite smooth as well as heavy and can easily slip through the hands .
Will probably never buy a HP again .
-4 RAM slots , 2 HDD Bays * , 16GB RAM support - No Wireless Issues , at least for me .
Support has been lackluster and now I just want a refund .
It 's not a recommendation , it ' a plea .
So you out of of notebook and money .
I called Toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem .
So this review might be a tad bit bias .
I had my PC laptop for 3 years and going to a MacBook Pro is like I leaped through time .
I am stuck with a laptop that I can not do very much with .
I had to re-install Windows within two weeks of the purchase and soon discovered cracks in the screen hinges .
They are by far the easiest systems to actually learn about computers with .
NO STAR FOR THIS TRASH . [ ...
My problem was with DELL Customer Service .
I paid $ 800 for this computer from my school campus bookstore .
Yet , HP wo n't do anything about the problem .
I bought this laptop for my son in 2007 for his Christmas present .
Speakers do n't get that loud , but good enough .
This was purchased for my daughter and I was pleasantly surprised .
Yeah , to you .
Awesome form factor , great battery life , wonderful UX .
Oh , boy !
The durability of the laptop will make it worth the money .
The sound was crappy even when you turn up the volume still the same results .
The graphics are stunning .
I bought this notebook and only had it for 3 months If it is overload with updates the BOOT MGR .
Having heard from friends and family about how reliable a Mac product is , I never expected to have an application crash within the first month , but I did .
I loaded windows 7 via Bootcamp and it works flawlessly !
first i have been searching for long time before i decided to get mac .
Finally , I should note that I took the 2GB RAM stick from my old EeePC and installed it before I even powered on for the first time .
Purchased a Toshiba Lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out .
In addition , all the design tools on Pages and Keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations .
They really do have the worlds very worst repair service .
They definitely have a superior product !
We did not even have it a year .
So I called Compaq , and after being on the phone for 3 hours , i finally got a replacement which I should n't have had a problem getting since it was under warranty .
The item received was exactly as identified .
Even if Apple replaces whatever needs replacing I wonder if , since I seem to be doubling the amount of time I get out of it each time it 's " like new , " I might have 8 months next time .
Typically , when I purchase a new laptop I always end up using an external mouse for convenience .
Suffice it to say , my MacBook Pro keeps me going with its long battery life and blazing speed .
- No backlit keyboard , but not an issue for me .
The other day I had a presentation to do for a seminar at a large conference in town - lots of people , little time to prep and have to set up a computer to a projector , etc .
10 hours of battery life is really something else ....
I think it was seventy nine plus tax .
This laptop is a great price and has a sleek look .
I 've had hp desktop for over 4 yrs now and not one days goes by that i do n't regret buying it .
I 'm hoping that I can find a really quick way to clean it without it getting too gross .
I used windows XP , windows Vista , and Windows 7 extensively .
Plain and simple , it ( laptop ) runs great and loads fast .
I also love the design , the looks , the feel , and the my toshiba feature is wonderfull .
i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have .
Maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden .
Fully charged , the MacBook Pro can last about five hours unplugged .
Buy the separate RAM memory and you will have a rocket !
I waited and waited and no laptop .
BTW , I checked online regarding the old laptop that ' died ' and found that I was not alone , far from it .
I am able to organize my pics , music and files easily .
Very nice unibody construction .
I upgraded the memory and replaced the base Windows 7 Starter to Win 7 Home , and it runs just fine .
Easy to carry , can be taken anywhere , can be hooked up to printers , headsets .
I fell in love with it .
It 's software and speed enable it to do amazing things .
This is great if you have several lectures back to back and do n't have a chance to charge during one of the lectures .
I just fell in love with this thing .
They 're absolutely useless , unless you count the joy of releasing anger while smashing into little peices against the wall .
Setting would change for some reason , the screen size would change on it 's own , like the pixel sizes and whatnot .
I should have realized that trouble was brewing .
It 's A MAC !!
The 4 USB ports are nice , but the two on the side only work now and then .
I let my friend borrow it , and she knows nothing about computers , and she used it with ease .
I ' v spent as much for shipping as I would to buy a new netbook -- of course a different brand .
I upgraded it 's RAM to 2GB , I am very happy with it .
This computer gets very hot , before shutting down .
( but Office can be purchased ) IF I ever need a laptop again I am for sure purchasing another Toshiba !!
DEFINITELY recommended !!!
These new problems were the final straws ;
This was a great deal for a decked out MacBook Pro .
I am able to play 720p and 1080p media files just fine with it .
this laptop is durable and it is easy to travel with .
Lord HAVE MERCY !
OSX Mountain Lion soon to upgrade to Mavericks .
Once you go Mac , you ca n't go back !
I 'll rather be out of date then spend more money on toshiba .
Apple removed the DVD drive Firewire port ( will work with adapter ) and put the SDXC slot in a silly position on the back .
I do not plan on going back .
I was psyched .
The computer continued to give me issues and in Late June it completely died again and I tried to call Acer again to get it fixed and they refused to help me , they said my warrenty was up and hung up on me .
I really wish I had done this years ago .
I bought a HP Pavilion DV4-1222nr laptop and have had so many problems with the computer .
The Macbook is a fantastic laptop .
There is no " tools " menu .
Completely worth every single penny dime and nickel .
I 'm definitely not hard on laptops and guarantee 100 % that no liquid has touched this machine in my presence .
No I am generous calling it slow .
In early May I got it back and this time I only had it back for 1 day before it had a NEW issue so it was sent back in for the 6th time they " expedited " the repairs so I was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed , by a " Senior Tech " .
) I also purchased Applecare for $ 300 , which is a three year extended warranty , since I ve never seen any laptop that lasted more than two .
But other than that I am blown away by all the features this laptop offers .
without a big ol' clunky machine in my backpack , I feel like I can do programming homework anywhere .
I hope this review helps .
Which I still use and have hooked up to my TV .
After about another month I had to send it in AGAIN to Acer for repairs .
I 'm Not exagerating when I say this computer is perfect . . i It is !!
So , I 'm cooled on Mac buys .
I just hope the reputation that Toshiba has is true and I wo n't have to worry about a crash .
My last computer , a Toshiba , cost only $ 400 , and worked like a charm for many years .
I 'm making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the ' old ' way - and Apple does , indeed , have the better idea .
99 to fix it .
The laptop is very lightweight , can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight .
This laptop is a great buy .
Great OS , fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port .
the mouse on the pad , the left button always sticks .
Great Laptop for the price , works well with action pack games .
I was informed that I need to call some 0900 number first .
I will never go back to Windows !
In November my computer messed up entirely and would n't power on after intalling a Windows update , I had to have my HD flashed and lost EVERYTHING on it , including my school assignments and irriplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things , when this update was installed for some reason I was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installed it deleted my history .
it was shooting sparks !
There is NO way I will buy a LG product in the future .
Good in every aspect .
I got the Macbook and he got a Macbook Pro .
Features such as the Dashboard ( allows you to view frequently used tools like a calculator , weather forecast , movie times , calendar , computer post its etc .
In my line of work , I often have to take work home , and this makes it so easy .
The real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and it 's speed .
See retired recently and decided that she wanted a laptop .
so i called technical support .
When I finally had everything running with all my software installed I plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed .
Needs Power and Mouse Cable to Plug in back instead of side , In the way of operating a mouse in small area .
taking it back less than 24 hours of purchase
Love it so far .
While it was highly rated , would I like it ? I tried the keyboard at the store , and it seemed ok .
The sound as mentioned earlier is n't the best , but it can be solved with headphones .
My wife also has problems with her Asus - different model .
Obviously we both got new Macs .
It is extremely portable and easily connects to WIFI at the library and elsewhere .
Since I never really got to use this , I ca n't comment on anything except what went wrong after trying 2 of them .
This is the first laptop I 've owned , althougth I used several at my previous job .
They should have included more memory on their computers if they knew Vista would run slowly .
although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks .
Every day I had this computer , something failed on it .
This can be annoying at first but you just have to train yourself not to to start over so far .
i have dropped mine a couple times with only a slim plastic case covering it .
Then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me .
It is extremely fast and very compact .
