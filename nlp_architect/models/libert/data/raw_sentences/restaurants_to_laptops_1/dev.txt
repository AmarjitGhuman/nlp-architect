It is not an easy decision to purchase a used or even good as new laptop but I am very satisfied .
In desparation , I called their Customer Service number and was told that my warranty had expired ( 2 days old ) and that the priviledge of talking to a technician would cost me ( " have your credit card ready " ) .
Very fast and efficient !
I could n't believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge .
I had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity , because it is very sensitive .
tosiba has a good reputation , my llast computer was an acer .
I ca n't begin to say how disappointed I am .
Screen size is perfect for portable use in any environment .
Additionally , there is barely a ventilation system in the computer , and even the simple activity of watching videos let alone playing steam games causes the laptop to get very very hot , and in fact impossible to keep on lap .
Apple is unmatched in product quality , aesthetics , craftmanship , and customer service .
The computer would not ever cut back on .
It discharges too quickly .
The Computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks .
Also , if you need to talk to a representive at Microsoft , there is a charge , which I believe is robbery , since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system , which most people would have went with XP if they could .
I 'm honestly afraid that it will burn me , it 's that hot !
THIS IS MY SECOND MAC BOOK PRO .
The little battery that it did have would only last about an hour while just having it on the desktop .
I left the place angrily .
All I can say is I am impressed .
All I will say now is that it was over two grand less expensive and so much better quality than my hunk of crap Vaio .
The only thing i can say is that the touch pad doesnt work like it should all the time .
It 's not like I have used for half a year and then complained about it .
And I 'm still paying the bloody financing , for a product which did n't last me at least three years !
the internet can be an scary place its up to you on what you do with it .
packing and everything was perfect
I think I might rather suffer for something that is simple to fix in my opinion .
I bought a Logitech desktop set in anticipation for using with the MBP , but I use the touchpad 90 % of the time .
Yeah , of course smarty pants " fix it now " ) Software - Compared to the early 2011 edition I did see inbuilt applications crashing and it prompted me to send the report to Apple ( which I promptly did ) .
The screen gets smeary and dusty very quickly and it 's very noticeable .
Everything about the Mac is not only visually appealing , but very easy to use .
It was n't worth it .
I will never buy another HP computer .
It was about six months later when the overheating problem started again , to the point it felt like fire on the bottom of the machine !
Im very happy with this computer !
: - ) If you buy this - do n't go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life , and you 'll be perfectly satisfied .
But the biggest pain is that tech support is not available 24/7 .
They need to stop outsoucing and send some complaint calls to US based customer service agents for those who live in the United states .
I personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers .
Laptop is to be used like a Netbook .
The keyboard has a wonderful nature feel .
Browsing , also , was no problem for me when I used itunes ( which usually slows down my PC ) .
I got the blue screen of death the first month I got it .
Mom , Dad , Brother , sister , You name it !
I had to get Apple Customer Support to correct the problem .
Programs would crash all the time , and it turned out to be a very unstable , unreliable laptop for me .
Very light and easily maneuverable .
Next , most Acer laptop fans are on the bottom which is right on your laptop .
The gray color was a good choice .
Runs like a champ .....
A great computer for light home use and business use .
One more thing , this mac does NOT come with restore disks and I am not sure if you can make them direct from the mac like you can with newer PC 's , also the charging cables are made of the same cheap material as the iPhone/iPod touch cables .
Other Thoughts : Received replacement 16 Days later .
My friends or children use that when they need to borrow the Net =) When I out grow this Meaning when its old and my oldest child is ready for one she will get this one ANd I will be buying only TOSHIBA !
That 's the downside for me .
The Mini 's body has n't changed since late 2010 - and for a good reason .
I needed a new computer for graduate school ( had never owned a laptop before ) , and the only reason I did n't purchase a Mac was because my school 's website strongly recommended students purchase PCs .
However , If I sound enthusiastic about this , I am !
The touch pad is among the best .
I called Toshiba where I gave them the serial number and they informed me that they were having issues with the mother boards .
My kids ( and dogs ) destroyed two power cords by pulling on them .
All in all great item highly recommend it .
My real problem with it ? The statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it 's a lie .
I managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me .
I had read online that some users were having sound problems .
Apple did a great job .
The battery life sucked the juice from my laptop and when the extended life battery went out we were SOL there to , so much for that warranty covering all the products we purchased .
I purchased two laptops ( for my husband and 16 year old daughter ) .
I 've had friends with Acers who seem to have had similar or exact same problems .
I never tried any external mics with that iMac .
I got it back again and was told the motherboard had been replaced , so I was now on the SECOND motherboard within 3 months .
Its a good laptop for its value .
My wireless system would not recognize Windows 7 and I could n't get online to find out why .
However I dealt with this problem for over a year and it was more of a hastle then I have EVER had with anything .
The materials that came with the computer did not include the right # anywhere .
It could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have DDR5 instead of DDR3 .
The battery does n't last long but I 'm sure an upgrade battery would solve that problem .
But my blog is read by my friends and search engine visitors .
not using wired lan not sure what thats about .
Granted , it 's still a very new laptop but in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops , my Mac boots up noticeably quicker .
The on/off switch is a bit obscure in the rear corner .
With Windows laptops a wireless mouse is an absolute must .
I claim that this has no value to me , the laptop was new anyway .
A * big * upgrade from my 13 " 2006 macbook .
However , the machine itself left a bit to be desired .
Having someone give you a quick tour of how to 's is the best .
Exactly as posted plus a great value .
I believe I purchased this in Dec 09 for my primary work laptop which is used 5-10 hours a day , 4-6 days a week .
The first one sent : Touchpad did n't work The second sent : USB did n't work The third sent : Touchpad did n't work The fourth sent : Has n't arrived yet .
They also have a longer service life than other computers ( I have several friends who still use the older Apple PowerBooks ) .
This laptop leaves alot to be desired , I have had it only 5 months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice ...
It has been to early to see if this actually fixes the problem or not though .
the only fact i dont like about apples is they generally use safari and i dont use safari but after i install Mozzilla firfox i love every single bit about it .
THE FIRST PROBLEM IS THAT THE KEYBOARD FUNCTION IS SIMPLY UNSATISFACTORY .
I spent 2200 dollars on a " top of the line laptop " .
the whole experiece is horrible so save up and buy a better laptop .
In fact , somehow ( and I never opened it up ) some specks of dust or something got inside the screen and are now there permanently , behind the front of the screen , in the way of the display .
On start up it asks endless questions just so itune can sell you more of their products .
Sent unit back and it 's been two months .
They are about the same size keys .
This is a great machine !
And the ram ( the thing that makes it faster ) comes sporting 2 gigs for high performance to handle more stuff at once and surf the web a whole lot faster than before .
12.44 seconds to boot .
It also does not have bluetooth .
It has far exceeded my expectations for power , storage , and abilitiy .
i will be returning it and switching brands when i get to best buy .
The best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features .
If you want more information on macs I suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications .
Everything I have tried has worked and I never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome .
After paying several hundred dollars for this service , it is frustrating that you can not get help after hours .
It was returned on the third day I owned it .
Page just disapeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something .
It is a cheap throw together .
Have used only Macs for years .
I would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express .
No HDMI port .
breaks easily .
The graphics are great .
It 's catatonic .
The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months , stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes .
MY ONLY PROBLEM IS I CAN NOT REG . THE PRODUCT KEY .
Thank you .
I have used both PCs and Macs and I have to say that I really really love my Mac Book Pro .
This has happened three times so far .
There was a little difficulty doing the migration as the firewire cable system ca n't be used with the iBook .
The pricing is very competitive .
The touchpad is very intuitive , so much so that I never want to use buttons to click again !
Anyway , in early July of this year , the DVD burner stopped working , and the computer stared having issues with power supply .
Also , I have had alot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines .
The downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook : screen size is not something I 'd stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week .
The laptop was returned but audio issue was not fixed .
Satisfy what I paid for it .
So I called customer support ( which is good too ) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all , I just chose to hide the message .
I 've been a PC user and I just finally switched and I am never going back .
Very annoying .
I ca n't believe how quiet the hard drive is and how quick this thing boots up .
It was a laugh too !
Also , because of the size and consistancy of the laptop computer , some websites would n't even attempt to work on the computer because of browser problems .
I still have that stupid bluetooth mouse to !
Very happy with my 7th Toshiba laptop !
Harddrive was in poor condition , had to replace it .
I hope to edit this in the next few hours , I am going to try to install my own copy of Windows 7 .
However , a NETBOOK will be a different story .
This is especially disheartening when Apple prides itself as the choice of creative professionals .
I would highly recommend this one to my friends
I have in the past gotten superfine sandpaper and " fixed " the edges by rounding them off .
The screen is nice , side view angles are pretty good .
The first time it crashed was maybe going on a year and a half of having it .
I WILL NEVER AGAIN buy another Acer , not will I buy Gateway , or eMachine as they are all from the same company .
I dislike the weight and size , cubersome .
Perfect for all my graphic design classes I 'm taking this year in college : - )
One year of trying to fix the computer by myself , with help of friends , and even help from computer experts I have given up on trying to fix it .
The MBP is beautiful has many wonderful capabilities .
They discovered the manufacturer 's defect and sent it in for repair .
4gb of ram ...
Acer was no help and Garmin could not determine the problem ( after spending about 2 hours with me ) , so I returned it and purchased a Toshiba R700 that seems even nicer and I was able to load all of my software with no problem .
That day !
The OS is easy , and offers all kinds of surprises .
They sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that I return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later .
A lot of features and shortcuts on the MBP that I was never exposed to on a normal PC .
the retina display display make pictures i took years ago jaw dropping .
I know that ASUS is known for making motherboards , but this is the worst computer experience that I have ever had .
It 's also very pricey but you just have to tell yourself it 's an investment and that it 's gon na last you a long time .
It is known as Safari , and if you are doing any website work , you should know that many hosting companies do not support it .
First , it does not have a push button to open the lid .
The RAM memory is good but should have splurged for 8Mb instead of 4Mb .
I tell everyone that I know , friends , family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used .
Mine came at $ 1,700 w/o a DVD burner ( ! ) .
Took it back as it was defective .
It was loaded with Windows Vista Home Premium -- delivered with only 1GB of RAM , and it was a * dog * .
In my opinion it was not as user friendly as I expected either .
My last laptop gave me a constant battle even though it was also completely new .
If internet connectivity is important I would recommend going with a dell net book for 50 bucks more , or buy a USB wireless card .
I was not aware that this product can not display websites that contain Flash .
Downfalls : sharp edges .
The one down side to it is that when I play a certin game on here , it tends to freeze up sometimes , but thats the only bad thing about this computer .
Its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer .
Perfect trifecta !
I bought it from HSN because it was " bundled " with extra software , but as it turns out , that software just crashes it more often .....
I finally pulled the trigger and I am blown away by how much more I enjoy my computer tasks using the Mac Mini !!!
Yes , that 's a good thing , but it 's made from aluminum that scratches easily .
Our Apple 13.3 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer ( Z0J80001 ) Notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking .
If your time is worth anything to you , if you are tired of rebooting , reformatting , reinstalling , trying to find drivers , if you want a computer to work for you for a change , make the change to this computer .
Its good for playing my apps on Facebook or watching movies .
With the softwares supporting the use of other OS makes it much better .
when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase .
The OS takes some getting used to especially after being a Windows user for so long but the learning curve is so worth it !
To those thinking about switching , do it and do not look back !
Guess I 'll stay away from HP .
It 's fast , quiet , incredibly small and affordable compared to other Mac models .
This was the same problem with my MacBook ( circa 2007 ) that I just retired .
The speakers are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones I have ever seen in a laptop so if your planning to listen to music I suggest you get something better .
so when I had the money to buy one I bought other things instead .... a 700 laptop and some extra stuff with it .
Took me 11 hours , 3 trips to different FedEx offices , and brutal conversations with 14 of the worse IT support technicians in the world .
The case is carved out of a single block of aluminum .
Purchased as a gift for a friend .
I LOVE it !
I took 3-4 years researching brands and prices of laptops .
I 'd recommend this laptop to anyone !
So , I took it back to the apple store and they narcissist genius bar staff ) fixed it by resetting the fan at boot up .
compresses itself and you ca n't use it .
It did n't take me long to get switched over to the Mac computer programs and navigation - it 's been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better .
While we struggle with all the crashes and viruses , the kids computers stay consistent and so we caved in and bought one for buisness !
You will not regret buying this computer !
I called apple and no solution .
super fast processor and really nice graphics card . .
This is now my 3rd MacBook Pro and I really honestly love it !
very very slow laptop .
I like the design and its features but there are somethings I think needs to be improved .
The thunderbolt port is awesome !
Their products , including the MBP , are beautiful , sleek and clever .
I have nothing to regret from this new product .
The only thing I miss is that my old Alienware laptop had backlit keys .
I would recommend this computer to anyone searching for the perfect laptop , and the battery life is amazing .
I 'm not going to lie , I 've never really liked the Acer brand in general .
This mouse is terrific .
So far it has been five months since the last problem was fixed and I am PRAYING it has finally stopped .
You may soon mistake my digitus medius as a lively pogo stick .
The most recent being that my Safari internet browser is freaking out on me , but I have just been using firefox instead .
Apple is aware of this issue and this is either old stock or a defective design involving the intel 4000 graphics chipset .
My wife recently purchased an Apple MacBook Pro and our granddaughter fell in love with it and asked for one for her birthday .
I thought the price was great for the specs .
The battery life seems to be very good , and have had no issues with it .
THIS LAPTOP WAS BAD FROM THE FIRST DAY OF USE ---- BROUGHT IT BACK TO STORE FOR RETURN OF MONEY .
A tip for people looking into this computer : DO NOT BUY IT save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last .
I always have used a tower home PC and jumped to the laptop and have been very satisfied with its performance .
Its not just slow on the internet , its slow in general .
Many thanks , Overstock.com .
I loved it then , but unfortunately it was before the days of wireless internet .
She said its very user friendly .
How Toshiba handles the repair seems to vary , some folks indicate that they were charged for even an intial fix , others had the repair done 5 times .
Not sure how I recommend it for quality gaming , as I have a desktop rig for that reason .
Before i bought my new i5 , I did my research for about 2 weeks and determined to move for HP to Apple for reliability , dependable , and long lasting operations .
( I found a 2GB stick for a bit under $ 50 ) Nice and portable and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours , or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents .
On the twelfth day that I had the notebook , I decided to go to Dell 's website and update it .
I did not take the class and wish that I would have .
No tutorials on the display .
1st hand experience is very important , especially for a new customer .
It was getting old and I needed a new school computer .
To me it 's a workhorse ... and quiet as can be ... you even save big bucks not dishing out any extra to Uncle Sam ... Definite Buy ...
I ca n't even install one of the 3 printers I have in my house so I am unable to print .
Logic board utterly fried , cried , and laid down and died .
I am going to college next year and I needed a cheaper , quality computer for the goals I am trying to pursue .
It was a bad experience but i played down its importance .
I am forever changed and will no longer buy a Windows based machine for personal use .
The Awesomest of the awesomest .
We paid for the three year warranty and the extended warranty after that one ended as well .
The most amazing part to me as a PC user is the startup and shutdown times - and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing .
Size : I know 13 is small ( especially for a desktop replacement ) but with an external monitor , who cares .
I have a laptop as my regular computer , but found that disconnecting it and lugging it around was a drag .
Two of the times was in one month .
/ awesome cooling system / much better grafics card ( ATI 5870 ) / 8GB RAM / LED backlit screen ...
With what I paid for this computer it should have had everything on it .
THE MOTHERBOARD IS DEAD !
It has a overheating issue - nearly to the point of being dangerous .
The leather carrying case , keyboard and mouse arrived in two days from Memphis warehouse .
3 ) Horrible customer support
From the build quality to the performance , everything about it has been sub-par from what I would have expected from Apple .
It is fast booting up , shutting down , and connection with the internet .
Right out of the box , this little netbook did everything I asked of it , including streaming the everyday video you 're bound to encounter checking mail and websites ( my biggest complaint previously ) .
I can throw anything at it ( and I do ) , Pictures , video editing , schoolwork .
Probably wo n't work either .
I run Dreamweaver , Final Cut Pro 7 , Photoshop , Safari , Firefox , MSN Messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time .
I acually believe the issue is with the Nvidia grafics card , but still requires a return .
Though please note that sometimes it crashes , and the sound quality isnt superb .
I got this one for thanks giving Offer for $ 962 :) .
Otherwise this little notebook has met all my expectations .
I 'm so glad I purchased a Mac and not another PC !!!
I consider myself an average user and this computer serves my need .
I 'm stuck w / a broken computer .
When I got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct HP told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem .
A lot of help they WERE N'T !
Every single one we 've gotten we 've had problems with .
this apple navigates you thru the unexplored world of the internet .
Anyways I bought this two months ago and when I first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone .
This is a review of windows vista system .
Was n't sure if I was going to like it much less love it so I went to a local best buy and played around with the IOS system on a Mac Pro and it was totally unique and different .
Fan only comes on when you are playing a game .
Had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in .
I am pleased to report that it is one of the best presents I have received to date .
Runs very smoothly .
I needed something affordable from Apple and was tired of dealing with PC laptop after PC laptop .
I took it back to Best Buy where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a new one .
I love it - never had a computer I was so impressed with - and I 've had a lot of laptops and desktops - this one is FAR AND ABOVE THE BEST ONE I EVER HAD BEFORE .
It has happened again and I 'm being told that it 's $ 175 .
i would really recommend to any person out there to get this laptop cause its really worth it .
But the machine is awesome and iLife is great and I love Snow Leopard X.
It 's light and easy to transport .
It certainly does , but you rarely hear any of your friends with Mac 's complain about anything .
This is no exception .
So far , so good .
Not super light but still a good one .
I will only buy apple laptops from now on .
If you ask me , for this price it should be included .
I worked in IT retail sales before .
I had finally reached my limit and broke down .
I love this piece of equipment , It will be hard to go back to other type of laptop after using a MacBook Pro .
That 's right , no power , absolutely NOTHING .
Hope this helps !
They claim that I should be happy because I am getting a new laptop to replace my two-month old laptop .
I bought this Mac in order to replace my old Dell laptop .
If what you need is a machine to do some surfing , email checking , word processing , and watching a movie or two , this is the machine you want .
My friends are in awe every time they come over !
you can find many laptops with the same performance and even better with lower price , but you can not find the look , easy , applications , and the experience in mac .
I brought this laptop last friday , and originally it worked fantastic .
By Air sounds more like by truck to Me .
It still works and it 's extremely user friendly , so I would recommend it for new computer user and also for those who are just looking for a more efficient way to do things
As a computer science student in college , I find that the portability , longevity , and ease of use of this computer make me ( shockingly ) want to do homework more ;
Very disappointed with Apple .
I bought my macbook a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since .
Prior to this computer , I owned a PowerBook G4 for 6 years ( quite a long time for a laptop ) .
Getting the Apple Care plan is a must .
It is very well built .
Needless to say , not to happy with the product .
If you do n't like fingerprints , this might not be the laptop for you .
The great 18 month same as cash financing and Advance Protection Plan which includes accidents like spills .
Very dissappointed becase I have had toshibas for years , and never a issue .
One drawback I noticed was sound quality via USB .
Just a bunch of idiots who 's English as a 5th language is forced at best .
1 . You can not change your desktop background ( window 's 7 starter does NOT support that function ) .
But , for the cost this is a winner .
In short I would never buy a Compaq again .
The processor went on me , the fan went and the motherboard went .
The right speaker did not work .
It 's so nice that the battery last so long and that this machine has the snow lion !
I am using the external speaker - sound is good .
This unit is not .
My friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance , picture quality , and ease of use .
Do not buy it !
Took several hours with customer support before I could even start the PC out of the box .
I have found also , it is very easy to be able to access wireless internet access ;
Needless to say a PC that ca n't support a cell phone is less than useless !
Mac computers automatically " defrag " each time you start your computer .
I liked the aluminum body .
( The iBook backup also uses a firewire connection ) .
I started hainv problems with it within the first month .
I asked how they would determine that since there are no scratches , dents or other signs of damage and was told that was the only way this type of damage could happen .
i love ths notebook .
taking notes , research , an online class and such and did n't want to spend too much on my first machine .
The newer MacBook that I have purchased is one of the best computers .
I connect a LaCie 2Big external drive via the firewire 800 interface , which is useful for Time Machine .
Some features arent friendly ( volume wheel , sound quality , etc .
I 'm the pro-active type so I went off and did some preventative fixes .
As usual at customer service center , she asked me to hold for a moment while she went to the back-office and compare it with other same model netbooks and discussed it with her colleague ( I could see them ) .
When it broke I wanted another Acer and chose the V5 .
Mac is not made for gaming .
Other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more .
I love the way the entire suite of software works together .
I use my friends and family 's $ 2000 laptops and they are fast and reliable and HP , well , I 'll never buy or recommend an HP to anyone !
Plus it is small and reasonably light so I can take it with me to and from work .
I am finding my way around this laptop better than my last one .
Easy to start up and does not overheat as much as other laptops .
I highly recommend this computer for students looking for a solid machine to get them through college .
The Mac mini is about 8x smaller than my old computer which is a huge bonus and runs very quiet , actually the fans are n't audible unlike my old pc
Startup times are incredibly long : over two minutes .
It gives me the power and speed that I need to run all the programs I use to edit .
This newer netbook has no hard drive or network lights .
The backlit keys are wonderful when you are working in the dark .
The screen is bright and the keyboard is nice ;
It 's great and we will always stick with Apple computers , we have been so happy with them .
I can not even imaging going back to a PC after using this wonderful computer .
The shop will definitely push the problem to the service center .
And , if you are going to deal with HP be careful .
I hate the display screen and I have done everything I could do the change it .
Fan noise : The fan made a constant hissing noise in the background .
Have one myself and Love it !
Otherwise , I love it !
It 's not inexpensive but the Hardware performance is impressive for a computer this small .
It was definelty a smart move .
One of the primary reasons why I purchased an IPad was to store photographs so that I could show to my customers .
I had never owned a Mac before ;
I looked around and based off my price/features comparison from a brand I trusted I landed here .
First of all yes this is a mac and it has that nice brushed aluminum .
With all the goodies inside this machine , it is a value .
The only thing I dislike is the touchpad , alot of the times its unresponsive and does things I dont want it too , I would recommend using a mouse with it .
I honestly love my mac , thats why I am a self proclaimed mac addict .
The new os is great on my macbook pro !
I 'm excited to learn more about what this powerful machine has to offer and encourage others to do the same .
And now I am a proud MacBook owner also !
And it 's so quiet that I do n't hear it at all .
None of the techs at HP knew what they were doing .
fast , great screen , beautiful apps for a laptop ; priced at 1100 on the apple website ; amazon had it for 1098 + tax - plus i had a 10 % off coupon from amazon-cost me 998 plus tax - 1070 - OTD !
I waited to review to make sure it is what it is .
I bought this laptop so that the entire family had a computer in the living room ;
Customization on mac is impossible .
My only other complaint is that it gets really hot .
*** The review below is no longer relevant , Apple has fixed the issue .
It has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer .
at first !
Tech support tells me the latter problem is a power supply problem and have offered to fix it if it happens again .
By week two , my laptop had overheated and was completely dead even though I did not use it too much .
My Iphone synced right up just like a person would expect , unlike the PCs in our lives .
I 'm going to buy a logitevh c270 .
Somehow the system clock got messed up after reboot .
It works great and I am so happy I bought it .
Boots up fast and runs great !
I would n't play a first-person shooter with this , mind , but if you wanted to run MS Office , email , chat , download a video , listen to music from a certain fruit-named music store , and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in , I 'd highly recommend checking this out .
i use my mac all the time , i love the software , the way it takes a short time to load things , how easy it is to use and most of all how you do n't have to worry about viruses .
I have loved this since i took it out of the box .
The only issue came when I tried scanning to the mac .
I wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused , because they knew it was trouble .
I take it everywhere with me because it 's so easy to carry .
I also made a recovery USB stick .
The built quality is really good , I was so Happy and excited about this Product .
I find myself using the 10-key more than I thought I would .
I finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what I need it .
He said quite a number of people had encountered this problem and said it is a common issue .
This was my first MacBook purchase ever .
The resolution is even higher then any other laptop on the market .
EVENTUALLY we pushed hard enough to convince them that this was the MACHINE that was causing the problems .
It out performs any other laptop on the market today .
It is easy to navigate and update programs .
The Material this Pro is made out of seems a lot nicer than any PC Specs : Like I said this performs a lot better than any computer I 've had in the past .
Now the screen is going darker , darker , darker .
You just get a trial version either way .
this is my second one and the same problem , bad video card unreliable overall , this will be my second time returning this laptop back to best buy .
I had to pay $ 100 for a universal charger for this cheap $ 300 laptop .
One suggestion I do have , is to not bother getting Microsoft office for the mac expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a PC .
The Apple applications ( ex.iPhoto ) are fun , easy , and really cool to use ( unlike the competition ) !
It is amazing .
The worst a Mac ever did to me was freeze up .
As far as user type - I dabble in everything from games ( WoW ) to Photoshop , but nothing professionally .
It is sleek , smooth , and lightweight .
Using this machine is like a mild form of torture .
We both recently got new laptops .
Hard disk - The new editions gives you more hard disk space ( 500GB instead of 320GB ) but time has taught me never to trust an internal hard disk .
I have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied .
I will never purchase a HP again ever .
I did contact HP and share how unhappy I am .
So in late March , early April 2009 I was without it again for a couple weeks while I had online courses I had to complete and my fiance was in Afghanistan and web conferencing was the best communication method we had .
I was given a Mac as a birthday present and could n't be happier with it 3 years later .
you will not regret it , promise you !
My sister has the same Mac as me and she is in a band and uses GarageBand to record and edit .
the features are great , the only thing it needs is better speakers .
It makes sorting out all those photos on my digital camera a breeze , and organizing them by place , time taken , or sending them to an online print shop , or uploading them to Flickr or Facebook etc , is not hard at all .
Luckily , for all of us contemplating the decision , the Mac Mini is priced just right .
System is running great .
The only thing is that the battery wo n't last more than 1/2 an hour .
It 's very annoying .
Bottom line , if you can afford it , get a Mac !
company provides UPS shipping , fast , great !
My wireless provider confirmed my home internet is fine , and any connections I turn on should work .
If I had to buy another computer , I would most definetly buy an acer one computer .
This computer is really fast and I 'm shocked as to how easy it is to get used to ...
It is a bit heavy .
The Toshiba laptop I am using is easier to use than most I have tried .
The wheel that turns the volume up and down does n't work in real time .
As an owner of a Toshiba Satalite laptop computer things you should know before you buy .
It has easy to use features and all the speed and power I could ask for .
You may need to special order a bag .
The system it comes with does not work properly , so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all .
Not sure on Windows 8 .
By the way teachers , they offer a discount which helps !
I bought it to use in college and it is perfect .
Very satisfied .
Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase .
This computer is good for 10 days then it sucks for the rest of your life .
I have owned many computers and laptops .
it has times were it freezes for 10 seconds and then starts again .
You ca n't even get a satellite card which is why I bought to begin with .
No waiting to have my claim reviewed by someone in another state ( or more often , another country ) .
I love the Apple products .
My review mainly talks about the difference I have felt between an early 2011 and late 2011 mac book pro .
I got the black MacBook two years ago and have never regretted it .
I was concerned that the downgrade to the regular hard drive would make it unacceptably slow but I need not have worried - this machine is the fastest I have ever owned ...
I had in the past a Dell laptop and they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair technician to my house to fix it .
The buttons you have to press a little harder than most .
We use the built in tools often , iTunes is open nearly every day and works great with my iPhone .
The screen graphics and clarity , and sharpness are great .
I can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner .
But if you are in the computer field you probably would n't be here .
Very nice so far .
I did not have to call the support line at all .
And that probably explains why I 've already had my SATA controller go bad within a year of buying it .
Graphics are much improved .
This one has had the same effect .
I am definitely sold , and not going back to PCs for home use !
I just bought this laptop 3 days ago .
Also , it hardly ever crashes .
When I called Toshiba , they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $ 35 for the phone call , even though they did n't offer any technical support .
Learning all of the keyboard shortcuts only took a few minutes to get used to as some of the shortcuts are the same on Windows machines .
its by far faster and more stable then my PC .
I baby my electronics so I know for a fact it was defective and not anything that I did to it .
I am not happy at all with the product I purchased .
This flaw unfortunately detracts from everything else Apple got right with the Mini .
I use this for my tutoring business , and since I 'm always bouncing from student to student , it is ideal for portability and battery life ( yes , it gets the 8 hours as advertised ! ) .
This laptop does everything I need it to very well .
I WANT MY L505-s5988 BACK !
Finally , I could n't take it anymore and ordered my Apple .
I first purchased this Dell model " 1764 " on April 6 , 201
It was over rated !
PC users use the Powerpoint program for slide-show presentation and Mac users utilize Keynote .
do not buy you will be disappointed .
It is easy to go from one keyboard to another .
Typing on the keyboard becomes uncomfortable after extended use due to the sharp edges that your wrists rest on .
Nothing about it that i do n't love , apple always makes a great product .
It is absolutely horrible to use , despite all its so called advanced features .
After years of using PCs , a new Mac user is basically forced to re-learn how to use a computer .
I think this is about as good as it gets at anything close to this price point .
Also , macbooks come with much more features which are so cool !
This computer that I have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard functions .
It is as good as new .
Great product , very easy to use and great graphics .
A SECOND PROBLEM INVOLVES THE BATTERY WHICH IS ADVERTISED AS HAVING A STORAGE LIFE OF 11 HOURS BUT WHEN FULLY CHARGED SHOWS ONLY 7 HOURS OF SERVICE .
It had a seventeen inch screen which I wanted , but I did n't realize at the time it would be such a monster !
But to be honest , the compatibility issues and the other little quirks make me think I ll buy a PC next time .
Every driver on the drivers/applications DVD is everything you will need for a reload .
I am an Info Sys major in college , so I started researching this issue on my own .
My life has been enriched since I have been using Apple products .
My MacBook Pro has been a huge disappointment .
Three weeks after I bought the netbook , the screen quit working .
This is a great laptop and I would recommend it to anyone .
It s heavy for Mac book but is good .
A coupla months later , they change my hard drive .
So , if you 're thinking of a laptop , I would heartily recommend theApple 13.3 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer ( Z0J80001 ) Notebook for all your needs !
I would like to use a different operating system altogether .
So do n't get it .
* IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD LAPTOP , THIS IS NOT IT !
- Stay away from Apple , or hope you laptop does not break down .
I 've already upgraded o Mavericks and I am impressed with everything about this computer .
This was a significantly more affordable than getting a new MacBook Pro from Apple .
When I am next to my router on my HP I get full service , on my Eee PC I get 3 bars .
The laptop is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the Windows 7 starter and not the full Windows 7 .
Far superior to my MacBook .
Heck , I like all Mac computers , but they 're all WAY too pricey for the kind of economy the U.S. is going through .
My power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership , so it was covered by the Applecare warranty plan .
Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac .
The Like New condition of the iMac MC309LL/A on Amazon is at $ 900 + level only , and it is a Quad-Core 2.5 GHz CPU ( similar to the $ 799 Mini ) , with Radeon HD 6750M 512MB graphic card ( this mini is integrated Intel 4000 card ) , and it even comes with wireless Apple Keyboard and Mouse , all put together in neat and nice package .
I am ADDICTED to photo booth !
I 'm pleased .
I do n't really have a complaint .
It wakes in less than a second when I open the lid .
I will NEVER buy ( Refurbished ) again , I do n't cae how cheap it is .
Well i got this computer from Best Buy and I have had nothing but problems I bought the computer with a virus .....
The processor screams , and because of the unique way that Apple OSX 16 functions , most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software .
Waited on getting this computer , but it has been a great change .
I switched to this because I wanted something different , even though I miss windows .
It 's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook .
iTunes is a handy music-management program , and it is essential for anyone with an iPod .
Fast , fast and fast , the web pages just fly by .
Have had many higher priced computers crash and burn long before ever got to use all that great memory and speed , etc .
The driver updates do n't fix the issue , very frustrating .
They basically told me that the machine would be problem free now .
I would Highly recommend this MacBook .
It turned out it 's not really a problem to have a Mac .
Well I spilled something on it and they replaced it with this model , which gets hot and the battery does n't make it through 1 DVD .
I now realize that my $ 900 would have been better spent on a Windows laptop .
The programs that come standard with the Leopard running system are enough for the average person to run all the basics .
It is very easy to integrate bluetooth devices , and USB devices are recognized almost instantly .
It gets stuck all of the time you use it , and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work .
The OS is also very user friendly , even for those that switch from a PC , with a little practice you can take full advantage of this OS !
Speakers does n't sound that great .
The investment of a new MacBook Pro came at a price , but totally worth it for a good piece of mind .
But no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it ON THEIR WEBSITE !!!
The delivery was fast , and I would not hesitate to purchase this laptop again .
I wanted to spend around $ 700 to $ 800 so I was directed to a nice looking HP Laptop .
Better stick with another brand .
This comes in very handy for me as an educator .
When I turned it on , nothing .
Though you get a polite person , you often don t get a solution .
I could n't afford a new mac , so I bought a PC instead .
Apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached .
The Nortons virus scan is only for a very short time unlike others that usually are good for a year .
Great laptop for school , easy to use for beginners in the household .
- Called headquarters again , they report that TFT panel is broken , should be fixed by the end of the week ( week 3 ) .
Well , I started using Google Chrome , which is a little better , but it freezes too sometimes .
The new operating system makes this computer into a super iPad .
It is very easy to navigate even for a novice .
Easy to customize setting and even create your own bookmarks .
I love this product because it is Toshiba and its 15.6 " .
Trying to balance all of my roles leaves very little time for me to do anything , so I want to manage my time I do have to be the most efficient .
They break down just as often as PCs do , and the only reason they do n't get viruses , is because no one makes viruses for them , they 're not better in any way , they are worse , try finding virus protection programs for a Mac , they do n't exist .
I 've owned every " Pro " model Apple laptop for the last 8 years , this is BY FAR the WORST one I 've ever had .
The only thing I do n't understand is that the resolution of the screen is n't high enough for some pages , such as Yahoo!Mail .
If you have to ask you do n't own a Mac and your just not in the know .
The quality , engineering design and warranty are superior -- covers damage from dropping the laptop .
Ive had to call tech support many times .
So , owing to these problems , I went out and got myself an Apple MacBook Pro , which I am using with great satisfaction at this very moment .
Unless you do n't care how long it takes to get going , find something else .
so the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault .
Either way I 'm furious .
) And printing from either word processor is an adventure .
Be sure to have good air flow where ever you put it .
This wiped out several programs that were installed on the computer when it was bought .
I especially like the keyboard which has chiclet type keys .
Quick and has built in virus control .
The games included are very good games .
Awesome graphics !
also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard .
One drawback , I wish the keys were backlit .
and its really cheap and you wont regret buying it .
Never any doubt I would get a MacBook , just was n't sure which one .
With notes saying they replaced the hard drive .
I could save ten essay papers and have hardly any memory left .
So , I paid a visit to LG notebook service center at Alexandra Road , hoping they can make the hinge tighter .
I do n't do any high tech stuff on it , just write papers , check mail , and sometimes play games , so I ca n't reccomend it if you are in the computer field .
Thank you so much for the great item .
Wonderful zooming .
When calling Dell for help , reurn , or a new computer they were not useful and left it up to myself to figure out what to do with it .
But it may be potentially hundreds or thousands in the near future .
The battery life is excellent - 6-7 hours without charging .
It would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required .
Considering another computer should be out of the question
Other than that , I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities .
Seems to me that 's the best way to get Apple 's attention .
From the moment I opened the box to the present it has been a great joy .
I did add a SSD drive and memory
Price was higher when purchased on MAC when compared to price showing on PC when I bought this product .
The only thing I can imagine is that Sony jumped on early specifications for Vista requirements from Microsoft and designed it to those inadequate requirements .
It 's a good fix , in my opinion .
For my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin ( it happened 7 months ago ) they offered me an ITouch 8Gig ( you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich , offer a loyal customer like me , a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this ) .
Here are the things that made me confident with my purchase : Build Quality - Seriously , you ca n't beat a unibody construction .
So we exchanged it for the same on and after 2 hours it did n't work .
Highly recommend for daily use .
We upgraded the memory to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace increase in speed .
I use that alot on my desktop , so I am adjusting to not having it .
Time will tell .
This one still has the CD slot .
The Macbook pro 's physical form is wonderful .
This Mac Mini makes the Macbook Pro seem slow .
I definitely suggest getting an extended warranty , you will probably need it !
The Dell Inspiron is fast and has a number pad on the keyboard , which I miss on my Apple laptops .
I do n't like this company nor the toshiba brand , and I 'll never buy another one because I 've put more into it then it is worth .
i must keep it plugged in at all times because it will not keep a charge for longer than four minutes .
For the [ $ ] price ( special offer ) this is a great laptop .
I saved for this laptop for 3 months and I can tell you personally it was worth the wait .
It 's face and depanable .
The computer will constantly be getting hot and burning your leg unless you go through the hassle of taking off the entire back of it just to clean out the fan .
I loved it .
Apple hit a home run here .
Oh , it is such a great piece of equipment .
returned it to walmart .
I think the manual is somewhere on the hard drive , but I rather have a hard copy .
The only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible .
In short , you could say your mac could become your best friend ( no intention of replacing Rover your dog ) .
This device has met my expectations and I 'm sure it will meet yours .
Which it did not have , only 3 USB 2 ports .
We were PC users .
Frustrated I hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time .
I am so addict to this laptop .
Games being the main issue .
Was disappointed to find out that the model had been discontinued , apparently because of known motherboard problems .
It is very slim , the track pad is very much impressed with me .
Let me start with the good : So awesome .
Another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed $ 175 to send it in to fix it .
But see the macbook pro is different because it may have a huge price tag but it comes with the full software that you would actually need and most of it has free future updates .
Well , I had completed the presentation in powerpoint the night before on my PC , but took the Apple to the conference .
My husband purchased a laptop at the same time for about $ 300 less ( he got a pc ) .
Windows also shuts the computer down for no reason without warning .
I just ca n't fathom that the celebrated Dell would last a week in environment of free competition with normal products - it only survives b/c its substandard laptops are forced onto captive students and employees through question-raising programs .
I was tired of going without my laptop every few weeks .
I had static in the output , and I had to reduce the sound output quality to " FM " as opposed to the default " CD .
I 'm pretty sure it 's not newegg 's fault but when you turn on a computer you just bought you want it to at least get to desktop .
I am sorry that I purchased this laptop .
So you might ask , what did Apple do for me ?
I pondered very long over this decision .
The Mac takes about the same amount of starting-up time as the average PC , but keeps itself cleaned up and ready to use .
It has all the expected features and more + plus a wide screen and more than roomy keyboard .
My children wo n't even use it for their school work .
Every time I log into the system after a few hours , there is this endlessly frustrating process that I have to go through .
After about a week I finally got it back and was told that the motherboard had failed and so they installed a new motherboard .
I 'll wait and save up for a new one .
The keyboard is slick and quiet and not bulky like some other laptops I have had in the past .
Externally the keys on my keyboard are falling off , after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit , and the screen has a terrible glare .
) I also tried the touch pad and compared it to other netbooks in the store .
I sent it back AND THEY LOST IT .
System is loosing about 20 % of performance because of that .
Works well , and I am extremely happy to be back to an apple OS .
For the use it was purchased for it is a good Laptop .
Might not make the avid gamer happy but I do n't really think that is what this computer is designed for .
As well as having the plug in the computer come loose .
Everything about this computer is easy to use .
The operating system and user interface is very intuitive , and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing .
However , my girlfriend realized that the netbook 's hinge is a bit loose ( when you open or close the LCD ) .
I use it mostly for content creation ( Audio , video , photo editing ) and its reliable .
Hmmm - that high failure rate sure is n't reflected in the retail price .
If that is the case , then I am completely happy
I have had many , many issues with PC 's in the past and I 'm finally glad to have joined the Mac revolution !
I am constantly trying to uninstall programs , clean cookies , and delete unused files .
I 'm new - just switched from years of PC frustration .
and its not hard to accidentally bang it against something so i recommend getting a case to protect it .
They do n't crash .
The big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies , pictures and etc !
I love it so much .
If this would be your first Mac purchase then I would highly suggest that you take advantage of the class that they offer to learn about the differences between Mac and PC 's .
They informed me that I had around 7 " policies " or viruses on it .
It did not have all the features I expected it to have .
I 've owned this labtop for less then two months , already the mouse button has broke .
The cool thing about the Mac Book was that I went on my honeymoon and shot a bunch of pictures and movies with my iPhone , then I came back and put them onto my Macbook and made a pretty good DVD movie with all the pictures and videos from my trip .
The Mountain Lion OS is not hard to figure out if you are familiar with Microsoft Windows .
It weighed like seven pounds or something like that .
It is easy to operate and I have already ordered more software and gadgets for my new Rolls Royce of laptops .
I am first time Mac Buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the Mac offers .
Not to mention sometimes the whole charger unit will decide not to work entirely .
I 've had my computer for 2 weeks already and it works perfectly .
I 've had my Macbook Pro since August 2009 .
I have had another Mac , but it got slow due to an older operating system .
It is made better , thicker , and all out tough !
The repairs were made quickly though I must say , however the second time they shipped it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me .
Moving from a PC to Mac has never been easier , and I 'm glad that I did it .
It 's super fast and a great value for the price !
It 's graphics are n't bad at all , for the lower end of the MacBook Pro spectrum , easily capable of running StarCraft II and other games with comparable graphics .
Not as fast as I would have expect for an i5 .
The design is awesome , quality is unprecedented .
The display is beyond horrible .
3D rendering slows it down considerably .
The internet speed is spectacular .
Added an iMac about 2 years later .
I purchased a MacBook Pro and this to replace a couple of HP units that I was using .
But while this is one big advantage ( as you may know from the company s recent commercials ) there are other things to consider before going with Apple .
It is held in place magnetically .
The device speaks about it self .
The baterry is very longer .
Only problem that I had was that the track pad was not very good for me , I only had a problem once or twice with it , But probably my computer was a bit defective .
I only used it to browse the internet and and I dont know how many times it has spontaniously shut down and it is just a blank screen now .
This machine was a horrible experience .
What can I say , It 's an Apple .
so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop .
This was the second computer and brand bought that day .
The difference is the Toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space .
I took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one .
I bought it to be able to dedicate a small , portable laptop to my writing and was surprised to learn that I needed to buy a word processing program to do so .
Looking online , many people are having the same problem .
I found this laptop on sale for under 6000 at Best Buy which was a great deal !
WILL NOT EVERY BUY ANOTHER -------- LOU
Hewlett Packard HP Pavillion DV6000 Laptop is the worst laptop we have ever bought .
Small screen somewhat limiting but great for travel .
Apparently under the screen there are 2 little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth , they come loose .
Sure hope Best Buy will replace it asap .
This computer is exceptionally thin for it 's screen size and processing power .
I took it to the shop and they said It would cost too much to repair it .
It had a cooling system malfunction after 10 minutes of general use , and would not move past this error .
Screen is awesome , battery life is good .
I will upgrade the ram myself ( because with this model you can you can do it ) later on .
The screen resolution was exactly what I was looking for .
All in all , I 'm incredibly dissatisfied with this laptop , and with HP as a whole .
If you had PC for four years I can almost gaurentee that something would of gone wrong by now , maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer .
It was hard to handle and operate at school .
Sure , the initial out of pocket expense is greater , but that should not dissuade anyone from the fact that these machines run like none other on the planet , and when I factor in all the money in that I wasted on Geek Squad and the latest patches to de-corrupt my infested PCs , it probably comes out about even anyhow .
Because it IS a defective product .
It is super fast , and always loads .
I preferred the fit and feel of the 13 inch .
And mine had broke but I sent it in under warranty-no problems .
Toshiba knows there is a manufacturing defect but will not acknowledge it .
It is her first laptop and she is thrilled .
I would easly reccomend this laptop to a friend .
Fan vents to the side , so no cooling pad needed , great feature !
Sure it 's not light and slim but the features make up for it 100 % .
Then , within 5 months , the charger crapped out on me .
The unibody construction really does feel lot more solid than Apple 's previous laptops .
The acer one computer that I bought is 17 ince screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it , but I like the big screen on it .
What I 'd like is for the laptop to run well without having to purchase additional memory .
This computer is not cheap and represent an achievement for me .
I love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the Laptop in the sky !!
apple and quess what , you have to send the whole laptop in , too bad , so sad
The MacBook Pro is a great product which can meet the needs of the average consumer .
for 2 months .
Biggest complaint is Windows 8 .
I wish it had a webcam though , then it would be perfect !
You wo n't be disappointed .
This is my first personal Satellite purchase but had very good experience through previous Satellite work issued laptops .
Now , the next issue I had freaked me out .
My favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga port so I can connect it to a bigger screen .
Great overall .
Stay away from HP .
Money and time well spent !
I have never had to shut down the computer unexpectedly and the computer has never froze on me .
Sound card is limited though .
Everything is so easy to use , Mac software is just so much simpler than Microsoft software .
The new MacBook is lightyears ahead of my old white plastic MacBook circa 2006 .
The MacBook Pro is very sturdy and versatile .
Definitely worth spending the money on it .
Everything from the design to the OS is simple and to the point .
And inconvenient !
I do n't have stupid pop up windows ( even when I have pop ups blocked ) , I do n't have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download , and best of all I can run all the web programming software I need to use all at once without slowing me down .
He 's thrilled with his new laptop .
One , owning a mac is essentially a full production studio ( in the case of a mac book a portable version ) .
Has a 5-6 hour battery life .
Temperatures on the outside were alright but i did not track in Core Processing Unit temperatures .
And Toshiba is totally unconcerned .
Just for a stupid CD .
From the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer !
It is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an Alienware gaming machine .
This hardware seems to be better than the iMac in that it is n't $ 1400 and smaller .
No , tey do n't even support their own bios and it " could be a problem with the bios " How can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity ??!!
However the frozen screens kept happening .
This computer I used daily nice compact design .
It 's also very energy efficient , running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a 60 Watt lightbulb .
It 's fast at loading the internet .
I ca n't say enough good for it !
Now mainboard is broken , have to wait for a new one .
The only thing I wish is the 15 inch MacBook Pro has much better speakers on the side of the keyboard .
Be safe buy a Sony .
I like the Mini Mac it was easy to setup and install , but I am learning as I go and could use a tutorial to learn how to use some of the features I was use to on the PC especially the right mouse click menu .
I love how easy every thing is to do on my Apple products .
Bigger HD , better graphics card , and a bid HD .
I had my IWORKS , Itunes , Email , MS Office , network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour .
Summary : They played games with me for the warranty period .
Adjust the sensitivity since it 's not that responsive to begin with .
Quality Display I love HP , , it 's the only computer/printer we will buy .
cosmetically , the only thing they changed was 2 of the Function keys at the top .
I am loving the fast performance also .
They refuse .
My sisters same laptop broke about the month later for the same reason .
While lacking some of the functions of the other versions , this was very acceptable for the uses planned for this computer .
It took so much time .
Later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months .
Although I opted for the lowest end MacBook Pro , this thing holds its own .
I would recommend this product .
Actually , I think I was intimidated by the change from a PC .
The one thing I wish it had was a detailed hardcopy manuel .
I finally made the leap after my Gateway crapped out on me .
Can listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display .
This computer is the ideal college companion .
Also , the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it .
the apple pro notebook will not let you down .
She brought out 2 other identical netbooks and still insist that " It is like that one " .
Keyboard is reasonable size .
But the performance of Mac Mini is a huge disappointment .
Yes , he is a self professed " Mac snob .
I was very worried about making the two compatible - but literally , it was so simple I was almost worried that I was doing something wrong .
just chill and enjoy .
the speed is fine .
Bought for my daughter to take for starting college this fall - she has been on it non-stop ever since " learning how to use it " .
( Beware , their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a computer is .
The second issue I had with it occured a month later and it kept overheating , even if on for less than an hour !
Not too much " junk " software to remove .
Apple is always great about the aesthetics of things , they always come up with good looking products .
Skype is just so dang cool with this machine too .
I love the keyboard .
Pretty much made sense to get a Mini .
I saw the Mini Mac at Best Buy and decided to get this as my replacement .
i give this laptop a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me .
It fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and I have never had any issues with it freezing .
Of course , eMachines can not be made entirely to blame for this computer 's woes ;
Honestly , this is absolutely wonderful .
Never had a single problem , and do n't have to worry about viruses .
But if you 're willing to pay another 200 dollar for a windows disc .
I 'm still within the one year warranty but the repair " depot " has deemed that this time it was caused by physical abuse and is not covered .
It absolutely is more expensive than most PC laptops , but the ease of use , security , and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag .
I will not be using that slot again .
I will not hesitate to recommend it to family and friends
Came fully loaded - good .
BOUGHT FROM WAL-MART , I BELIEVE THAT THIS LAPTOP WAS A REPAIRED ITEM .
Again , I sent it off to Acer , by this time they were paying for me to send it to them and everything , but it was still inconvienent because of my classes and my communication with my fiance .
Once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts .
It had the full sized touch pad with 2 buttons instead of just one .
Windows Vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service .
But the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing .
It came in brand new and works perfectly .
I love the feel of the key board , as well as the trackpad .
After a little more than a year of owning my MacBook Pro , the monitor has completely died .
It 's silent and has a very small footprint on my desk .
The performance is awesome .
Toshiba is a great brand , even though I have n't had it for a long time , I am very happy with it !
Best thing is I can use existing 32 bit old programs .
Dell wanted to charge us for everything everytime I called them with a problem .
Best money I ever spent .
I love my macbook pro !
It was always getting froze up .
Did not enjoy the new Windows 8 and touchscreen functions .
After way too many times sending the thing in for repairs ( delivery service was slow , and without the laptop I had no access to the internet , and thus no way of tracking it to find out when I might hope to see my computer again ) , it finally kicked the bucket after just over 2 years .
It works great for general internet use , Microsoft Office apps , home bookkeeping , etc .
HUGE Apple MAC Fan !
The only objection I have is that after you buy it the windows 7 system is a starter and charges for the upgrade .
This computer had exactly the specifications I needed .
tried windows 8 and hated it !!!
That was a big mistake .
* 6th week * - They are not responding to my emails asking when they expect to dispatch the new unit ...
I would buy one of these for every person in my office if I could .
Was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba ? Probably not ever again .
Many people complain about the new OS , and it 's urgent for Apple to fix it asap !
The problems started with just the screen freezing .
Not super fancy , but not super expensive either .
This laptop is very large and barely fits in any carrying cases .
Looks nice , but has a horribly cheap feel .
I Have been a Pc user for a very long time now but I will get used to this new OS .
I edit and burn to DVD a lot of video , so I obviously could not live with a non-functioning drive .
it is very easy for anyone to use an apple and specially the mcbook pro notebook .
Best commuter I have ever owned .
However , this laptop has a fatal flaw that i discovered merely a week after buying it .
I seem to be having repeat problems as the Mother Board in this one is diagnosed as faulty , related to the graphics card .
I dislike the quality and the placement of the speakers .
I did an internet search and this is a very common problem with this laptop .
The biggest problem is that the box had no instructions in it .
My dad has one of the very first Toshibas ever made , yes its abit slow now but still works well and i hooked to my ethernet !
tech support would not fix the problem unless I bought your plan for $ 150 plus .
I like to use it at the race track to handiecap the horse races .
The advantages of owning ' a ' mac are numerous .
At home and the office it gets plugged into an external 24 " LCD screen , so built in screen size is not terribly important .
The battery life is excellent , the display is excellent , and downloading apps is a breeze .
I am overall very pleased with my toshiba satellite , I like the extra features , I love the windows 7 home premium .
Just bit the bullet and bought the Mac hoping it will last a lot longer … .
I was n't really sure I wanted to spend that kind of money !
Its pretty much fire it up and go .
The keyboard is like no other laptop keyboard .
More times that not the screen pops up saying I have a bad internet connection , or the page ca n't be displayed .
i love the size of the computer since i play games on it .
Good bye BLUE SCREEN and Critical errors !!!!
Though the picture , video , and music software is nowhere close to professional grade software Im used to ( CS5 ) but does the job for beginner and even intermediate media designers .
really no problems with the hand me down computers I received from my children .
bought the first asus laptop in san francisco , returned it in santa maria , thinking it was just a problem with that computer .
- When I started worrying for not hearing anything from them , I tried to call .
This is a great value for the money .
The battery life also does n't keep up with the claim but still I think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack .
Thanks for the fast shipment and great price .
The pro is a great product , I wish that the 13 inch models came with the Intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge ( the edges hurt my wrists ) .
The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely .
and it fits in my briefcase with ease
I bought it for college and so far it 's amazing !
I do not like too much Windows 8 .
Very powerful especially for the money .
They sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still did n't work .
It is really thick around the battery .
There is nothing better .
I know that everyone thinks Macs are overpriced and overrated , but once you get past the initial expense you 'll find that they 're worth every penny ( besides , there 's always the financing plan that Best Buy offers ) .
I 've been impressed with the battery life and the performance for such a small amount of memory .
The exterior is absolutely gorgeous .
We purchased this as a back up computer after our more expensive HP needed to be repaired .
Another THREE weeks later I had my laptop back with a new mousepad , keys , and casing .
great machine if you want to drop the cash for one .
this company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this " never " happen ...
Applications open in seconds and there are no lags , hiccups or awkward moments when you wonder whether your computer is out for tea .
I thought that it will be fine , if i do some settings .
Very good quality and well made .
bought notebook 07/2009 .
Ca n't wait until I go on vacation and take it with me .
I 'm having the laptop returned unrepaired since paying $ 176 every 3 months just is n't worth it ( that 's about how long the port seems to last ) .
and if u did .
Having USB3 is why I bought this Mini .
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse .
The battery is not as shown in the product photos .
but now i have realized its a problem with this brand .
After numerous attempts of trying ( including setting the clock in BIOS setup directly ) , I gave up ( I am a techie ) .
The only downfall is the battery only last 1.5-2 .0 hrs when not plugged in .
There is hardly any memory on the computer 's hard drive .
If you can afford a new laptop , and are in the market for one , of course , then definitely go for this .
I know some people complained about HDMI issues but they released a firmware patch to address that issue .
I burned my leg , after lifting it from my desk , and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table , so I can place it there .
Bottom line , I doubt you 'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine .
I bought my Acer Aspire custom made in June 2008 .
The company sent me a whole new cord overnight and apologized .
I will never buy anything from HP again !
the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer , left right and front .
Overall , it 's ok .
I have n't used the product long enough to write a detailed technical review .
The only thing that is n't perfect about this netbook is the speakers , they are not loud at all but I expected that .
This computer is also awesome for my sons virtual home schooling .
This is what they told me : It heats up , and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops , and simply categorize them as portables .
The battery gets so HOT it is scary .
So I got another netbook which I love !
It 's so useable and responsive .
I was amazed at how fast the delivery was .
I have been a mac user since the mid 90s .
I remind myself from time to time to take off my watch when ever I look at the small scratch that it has caused .
Replaced this one with my mac that was stolen , its a great computer .
It 's small but powerful , light but strong , elegant and beautiful ... In resume : it 's a Mac !
I have had my MacBook for almost 6 months and can honestly say that I will NEVER buy another computer if it is not a Mac .
Comfterbale to use light easy to transport .
My laptop cost approximately $ 2,300 and DIED after only 2-years , 10-months and 18-days of use .
High price tag , however .
It does n't bother me though .
Still under warrenty so called Toshiba , no help at all .
