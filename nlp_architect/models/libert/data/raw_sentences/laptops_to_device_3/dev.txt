after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. .
i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it .
3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip .
at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice .
if you 're intrested in buying a spare battery it 'll run you another $ 50 , a little steep i thought .
what kind of a company does that !
now i have to return it and rip all my music again .
the camera was a marvel .
i was prepared to love it .
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .
a similarily priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room .
for the money apex machines have good features .
the nomad is sent back to creative labs .
i did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras .
a big plus in my book .
this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .
perhaps because of its smaller user base there is also a lack of accessories .
of course you do !
second , the " automatic " sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .
not sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear .
also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .
so much packed in a small case and very affordable !
as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) .
these problems were consistent , and also not present on another dvd player .
get cheaper panasonics or toshibas or even sonys .
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .
there are n't many reviews for the iriver ihp .
there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !
have used it frequently and have had no problems .
negative points :
the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful " scene " mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless .
the little digital elphs were the best-designed , most-elegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them .
after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd .
maybe it 's good for tvs with not so good color settings , but not good for my tv that already has very vibrant pictures .
if this doesnt bring back the picture , try pressing this button without playing a dvd .
yet they 've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone , including italian , german , and dutch .
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand .
this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .
if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .
the remote is a little hard to understand .
i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n't work !
this does n't affect the picture , of course .
wish it included somebody to re-rip all the songs .
that 's been my experience .
do n't drop this unit :
sold in other parts of the world :
i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times .
- excellent sound quality
the player 's mechanics are also flawed .
i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .
all rechargeable batteries lose their holding power over time ( around 2 years ) .
has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod .
battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargebles , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .
i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product .
it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for .
if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are .
it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ).
the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera .
do n't buy this player .
it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk .
i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .
we 'll see if i need them to .
go for it ...
sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .
this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .
tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent .
yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .
i first intended to buy the 3100 , but am really happy to invest the extra money for the 4300 .
very cheaply made .
red chair 's notmad explorer is great & recommended by about every reviewer to repleace the creative jukebox software .
but for now this will do .
dont let the bad reviews of the software change your mind .
a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .
have had problems since the first day
but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle .
it is light weight , sleek and attractive .
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .
having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .
i purchased the extended warranty ( something i almost never do ) when i returned the unit to get the replacement .
the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .
my goal of using it as a music player * and * data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake .
. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image
somewhat disappointed that i could not " hook up " to my sony multi brand remote commander .
still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features !
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .
however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off .
very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
i am even a bit technology oriented , so i thought it would be a breeze to set this up .
the volume level of the phone is not all that good .
you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .
i also registered the unit online and posted two messages to the apex support person ( there can 't possibly be more than one !
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .
well that was not a simple task .
the only creative software i am using is the device driver ( s ).
well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) .
the bottom line :
these are the reasons i think it 's great :
for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds .
i dare you to surf the net and find the code .
if the dvd is stopped , it will display " playback only " .
i received this as a gift for christmas .
3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .
look / design :
considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me .
after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds .
i highly recommend this phone to anyone .
i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience .
if you 're copying cds with windows media , its really simple to give your songs id3 tags , so thats what i do .
i bought the nomad when i went home on leave and it worked great for about a month .
it is not perfect though .
i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile .
be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries .
- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it .
the prior one looked and felt lightweight , cheesy , and assembled by the oppressed :
for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital .
if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .
1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .
- since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera .
i purchased it for it 's easy ability to accept cd-r hacks .
2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .
the distortion is not a flaw .
it is great to no longer wonder what music i want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip - now i just take everything .
nokia has definitely won me over with this one .
however , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution .
i am returning mine for a replacement , but if i receive another ad-2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund , but never buy another apex product in the future .
now i can always be in contact .
the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .
i bought an ipod and am very happy with it .
i 'm sending this pup back to amazon and looking for the 2500 on ebay .
if you have the appetite choose the one that you think has the least deficiencies or is best suited to you .
i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .
the storage capacity is great .
( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too .
thankfully amazon has free return shipping !
in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !
most of these " annoyances " , though , are comparable to what you 'll find on other cameras in this price range .
its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus.
while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .
save your cash - go for a brand that actually cares about their reputation .
it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .
comes with standard rca jacks for output , along with s-video output ( s-video cable not included , must be purchased seperately ) and also component video outputs .
unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .
6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .
best electronic i 've bought since i was born .
i purchased this phone after having been an at &#38; t subscriber with a nokia 8260 phone for over three years .
able to use service in another country :
always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !
the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ahwile .
otherwise , be smart , save the cash .
first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .
whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .
the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .
i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far .
4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .
settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .
i am going to have to try an online download and see if that works .
i first bought a 6 gig nomad jukebox ( original ).
sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization .
after i went through the transer issue , i returned the zen xtra and purchased the 40 gig ipod .
its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .
and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ).
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad .
rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .
you see , i can 't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product .
i ordered 2 .
tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .
i hoping they will then begin building quality dvd players again , as i do like them .
basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 .
got way too many blurry pictures .
not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .
so i pop-in my first dvd and start to watch .
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .
i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar .
it will not load any further songs on and customer service has no idea what to do .
hope the unit lasts as i 've only had it for 3 days .
the karma does have a stop button .
and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?
when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :
great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes
this almost made it worth the price alone .
-- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library .
i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it .
but heck it plays my alias dvds .
in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer 's remorse .
i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .
they fall in love with the product .
this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared .
thank you !
the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
my " fast forward " button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go .
i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable .
one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing .
i 'll have to borrow cd 's to rip from friends to even come close to filling the thing .
i love the pros and cons reviews so here ya go :
it has a nice color screen .
since the zen xtra does not use a folder structure , the " duplicate name " problem stems from the actual file name , not from the song 's title / artist / album .
luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can 't .
just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc.
( i guess only time will tell ? )
i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed !
i went to an at &#38; t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads .
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com
we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .
i got this phone in t-mobile 's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal .
( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however )
first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. .
i purchased two apex 2600 for christmas presents .
lastly , ipod / itunes will not play wma formatted songs .
having 4000 or so mp3s , i never got more than 500 transfered .
as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr .
while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs , mine has run well , and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase .
i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com .
is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel .
great quality picture and features .
it plays everything , even vcd 's .
awesome feature .
eax on : 6 hours eax off : 8.5 hours
many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .
+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine .
- the unit is easy to use and intuitive .
but that 's a moot point now .
i bought the apex ad-2600 dvd player for the family for christmas .
i purchased one of these to replace an ailing dvd player that 's a few years old .
i bought this camera because it fit my budget and the pre-production and production model reviews were positive .
i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .
i know the saying is " you get what you pay for " but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse .
nothing but hassle with this company .
if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it .
buy an extra battery - life is good but still somewhat short .
anyway , im gon na go find dennis now , have a nice day ! ! !
the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number .
i love my g2 so thought i would upgrade .
i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .
or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe .
it was no problem for me to use their software .
now as others said , so far this player is an awesome player , there are flaws .
rip your tunes at 192kb if you like , alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy , and you 'll get more tunes stored on it .
i will never buy another apex digital product !
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .
if that one fails too , and i hope if it does , let it happen in the first 90 days , not later , cuz thats the warranty .
the reason it does not get 5 stars
its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .
the higher the number the better the quality ( less data compression is used ) and the larger the file size .
but the major problem i had was with the software .
9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop
btw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information .
my favorite is to play " any track " - am rediscovering my music !
can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .
you might think you are saving money by buying an apex but in the long run you will spend more .
it was just a problem with the player .
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .
the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .
i took the camera and just gave it to someone .
the zen has no stop button .
you can find any song quicky by an artist , album , or genre search .
their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .
i have read a lot of the reviews and my phone does not have a hiss or anything that people are talking about .
3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .
4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .
i returned it once , then i sent it back , and it is crap .
if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time , you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country .
the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .
the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .
but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. .
technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !
again had to remove the battery .
you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost .
second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .
good points :
i have had this phone for about 5 months .
it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more .
it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .
you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .
i 'll still use my photosuite for editing .
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it .
that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce .
they are not wowable good .
i bought this product from amazon .
cheaper in every way .
and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .
the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .
however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures .
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !
i just got it today and have tried to verify the claims of other reviewers .
2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax .
the pictures are amazing .
even at the " normal " setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a " digital " .
i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .
and go from there ... if you chose one of the " all " options , then you do n't need to do anything until it 's done .
and since the current language selection was english ( even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were " ? " s and even though the songs had different names in chinese ..
if you purchase this product , definitely rip your songs through windows media player .
i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment .
software downloads on the site crashed my pc .
took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box !
stayed up all night trying to figure out that thing .
what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox .. .
that is a very nice feature .
it is made of plastic .
not many .
after about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player .
5 for " digital film " it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome .
i cannot recommend it enough ! !
bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .
the product manufacturer promised me 14 hours , and what i recieved was 6-8 .
" you can send it in , but i would n't count on ever seeing it or a replacement again .
i purchased this unit 3 months back and i think the unit knew when my warrenty expires .
player controls :
please , if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions , i 'm wait very happy .
but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .
range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
that 's what i did and hopes this helps .
spend the money its well worth it .
make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !
2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .
needless to say , the canon won , hands down .
i 'm really happy with this purchase .
the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . "
it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .
all these phones have color screens , polymorphic tones , and are internet ready .
1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office .
how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu ?
the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .
1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .
overall an excellent phone .
ok this is our first dvd player so what do i know .
it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . )
this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .
i got weird messages about it not being ok 'd by microsoft ( or something like that ) , then i thought it failed to load , then it loaded .
basically wat happened , is that the hard drive failed .
small problem .
i got this a while ago knowing nothing about it .
i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3-year - old unit again just to see .
simply configure the mediasource software ( or windows media player , or your ripper-du-jour ) to create file names that include artist and ( especially ) album names in addition to track names .
my office would not let me put the software on to my work computer .
i am still trying to figure out the may options it has .
update : january 27th 2004 - the second one crapped out only after a week - dont buy this product !
buy new ones asap. every time you move your face or something they pop out .
this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways .
i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there 's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first .
the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .
i am returning it , and again in the market for a multiformat dvd , svcd , vcd , mp3 , etc. player .
for `` cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does n't have any wow factor .
controls easy yo use and easy to get to .
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out !
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .
it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here .
i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .
fm receiver - it has none .
i was a little concerned to be the black sheep buying this player instead of the incredibly overpriced apple i-pod .
two days later the phone was returned to me in complete working order .
it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .
the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .
i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites .
i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .
some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get .
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .
then you can say , " my dissapointment only cost $ 39 . "
i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .
first there 's the unit itself .
the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .
please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used .
the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .
5 ) handle the player with care - it is not meant to be dropped .
those that have it like it .
i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .
anyway , on with the review .
i 'd always eyed the nokia phones and had heard decent things about t-mobile , so i gave it a whirl .
it may have taken several years to fill this up .
this player is an ideal purchase .
i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control .
what a disappointment .
on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !
- well-backlit keypad
i researched , held , tested , and observed 3 different brands .
the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .
it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice .
what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ?
i shopped around for a month looking for a good mp3 player , and all i heard was how good the i-pod was .
easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll / pushbutton .
easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot .
wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker !
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .
the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .
the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .
i love photography .
i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .
the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !
either way , can 't go wrong with this price .
yes it is 56k speed , but the functionality is what you are paying for .
i accually did n't buy the apex ad-2600 from amazon but , the reviews i found here helped me purchase it .
it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .
do too many stuffs to get to a free phone after rebate .
however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips .
the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .
saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable , as i already had a coax cable .
the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .
it is easy to " focus " in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .
and then you will start to belive them .
the software will convert your cd 's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to .
so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .
it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .
i use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday .
there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev. machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance .
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category .
imagine my shock - and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex .
ok , everybody loves the fm radio in this , but you want a cell phone first , right ?
- you just have to buy a new player .
playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options .
my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
what a disappointment !
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .
maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .
i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .
the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .
i do n't think i will ever use the full 30gb .
buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .
it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !
many before me have done that already .
the batteries would not charge .
in all a winning combination .
lastly , you cannot manage anything on the ipod itself .
. if you want to have the date ; time on the image , its only through their software " nikon view " which reads the images date ; time from the images meta-data .
try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .
i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem .
i highly regret trying to save a few $ with this purchase .
i 've had the player for about a month now .
i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards .
that meant even less light and just as much action .
i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition .
i have my mp3 's stored on my workstation .
comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .
update : the finish is more " mirror " than silver -- and i like it !
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 .
the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .
the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures .
i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .
i was told that it is no longer available , so there must be something really wrong with it .
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera ..
there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation .
the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .
at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe 's photoshop elments 2.0 software , and can 't praise it highly enough .
the player itself has all sorts of problems .
if you want to be a poser and follow the herd , mooooooh , then buy the i-pod .
one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .
interface - practically seamless .
the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .
had to cut out a window using a swiss army knife .
now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it !
it lasts , truly , 7 days on standby .
at $ 49 .
bought one for $ 49.99 .
even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal .
when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was .
being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .
but who wants the wires involved .
please go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story .
great camera , great investment !
a great new use for that underutilized computer .
i guess that 's why you so often see " ipodders " bashing every other player out there ( very often not knowing anything about them the whole " i spent $ 120 more for something not any better and so should you ... so i can feel better " thing .
the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .
so i took it back to best buy where i bought it and exchanged it for a newer zen 20 gig model .
still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera .
amazon has been working with me to refund my money , but they reminded me that i have past the 30 day return policy and this was a courtesy return .
looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual .
not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy .
i 'm pay in auto-debit in my account .
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the " rigor " of a business traveler .
i just want to at least try an exchange but you can 't get through to their number , it 's always busy .
6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .
the only drawbacks that i have noticed :
really happy with this little camera .
the player kept displaying " no disc " , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * !
the ipod is also an attractable piece , being lightweight and small .
the nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six .
the first one was the 705 which i hacked successfully to play all region dvds and disable macrovision .
i also own an " apex ad 1201 " dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 1/2 years ago .
i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died .
here 's where the ipod drives me nuts .
when talking the voice is not very clear .
the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .
also , there is the need to send the ipod to replace the batteries when they die ( which they will ).
one thing i should note is that i have only had this product for one day , so there are many options i have not explored .
i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow !
makes me use it much less than i otherwise would .
updating the unit 's firmware :
and so i must ask , what are cameras for ?
i bought this to replace an expensive ( $ 300 + ) onkyo dvd player that quit after only 3 years !
i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway .
a card with more memory is a must .
this is especially useful for those who listen mostly to pop music and store all those short ditties .
first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .
this one was rated very high by several people check out this site and epinions.com .
of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents .
the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .
unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd .
even if it has n't expired , creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty .
and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod .
the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive .
that is , if a folder on your computer called " mp3 " has slayer ( thrash metal ) , stravinsky ( classical ) , and ice cube ( rap ) in it , you will only be able to play the contents of that folder by searching for the artists or genres manually .
- included creative software is pretty poor .
however , if you are keen , you can attach a camera to this phone .
the workaround is to update id3 tags on your files ( through mediasource ) but it can be a hassle if you have many such music files .
is eax faulty ?
it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .
people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .
b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display
word ... peace in the east bruvah .
who cares if it does n't have multiple slots ?
now i may buy two !
but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately .
i shopped around for a while before buying a hard-drive mp3 player .
the sound from the player is ok .
it will read and play all cd audio disc .
does n't always register push-button movement .
video output stopped workin .
go get it .
8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ).
we tried it out christmas night and it worked great .
the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .
the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .
i have owned an apex ad-3201 for close to 3 years now and i love that deck .
i purchased it at a retail store , and got an extended warranty .
on an average , you would charge it once a week .
your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment .
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .
i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .
after playing with this little device , i do n't know why i would look at an ipod with the same space when it costs $ 500 and i got mine for a little more than half that price !
in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery .
7 picture quality is excellent .
i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way .
it was not my first choice .
the setup and transfer process was cake for me .
i just bought this player today and i already love it .
3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .
the phone has several color schemes you can choose from .
extremely convenient .
do not buy this product or any apex product unless you are looking to be frustrated and lose money !
get better headphones .
the powershot g3 is a great camera .
i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) .
t-mobile was a pretty good server .
-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .
pass this player up , and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas !
first let me give you the bad things :
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .
i love my new nomad , its great !
i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .
mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory .
i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .
connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !
4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do .
when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with .
6 . the g2 's " color effect " exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable " effect func " menu option available in all exposure modes .
i always shoot using the lcd panel .
i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous .
have had the player since xmass and love it !
with progressive scan , i expect it to play play play - and give my old pioneer a rest .
now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school !
once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers .
the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .
the entire unit was poorly crafted .
those who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it .
i 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens .
it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .
i purchased the phone last week and have been using till then . .
that beside you are prob. very well aware of many of the features that this phone is known for , and one that has not yet been mentioned : using this phone as a modem for any computer with a usb 1.0 port !
finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier .
i 've bought the very expensive sanyo 5500/vm4500 -- which i love -- and i 'm okay with my services .
i 'd like to see how well a small company supports its mp3 player in 2 years when its battery dies as all rechargeable do .
i will never buy a creative product again .
i own a 35mm slr camera and this is my second digital .
i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .
it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .
a $ 300 device and they skimped on the headphone jack ?
the battery recharges real fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .
i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .
i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .
i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone .
1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .
if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300 , i would order another just like it .
they take excellent macro shots as well .
this thing kicks mighty apple butt !
better actually cause my carpet looks clean , lol .
any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages .
so , i bought apex ad-2600 in november ' 03 from amazon .
while you can create a temporary playlist , you can 't store it permanently , delete songs , search very easily , etc.
i ordered this player for christmas , and so far i have it for only 2 weeks .
got it for christmas , still learning a few of the settings , but i do n't take pictures every single day .
i wanted a dvd player that had basic features and would be able to play dvd - r format disc 's that i had made myself .
it is small .
i was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke .
also , if i had already loaded and tagged by cds on my home computer , this would not have been an issue .
it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .
the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .
as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !
also love waking up to music with attached speakers .
seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection .
the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .
my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the " year " field .
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .
it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .
after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it .
i purchased this as a christmas gift on 12-4 - 03 .
friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it .
as i travel quite a lot , i 'd want something with gsm as well as cdma tri-band .
it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar .
the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .
i have tried the belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter but found there was too much interference .
after charging my card for the camera and for expedited shipping , 5 business days later , they still had n't shipped the product .
called customer service and basically was told to either keep buying univ. remotes to try or buy the replacement remote for $ 23 ( which is almost half of what i paid for the whole player ) .
after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .
many reviewers refer to it as " clunky " or " difficult " - heed their warnings .
what it lacks for me is n't available on one phone yet , namely gsm850 ( also sometimes known as gsm800 ) , bluetooth and edge .
i will say this .
this is quite simply the best you can ask for .
i doubt i will use half of the storage capacity , but you never know .
i spent much time debating on whether i should go with the zen xtra or the ipod .
the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs .
i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .
removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .
a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .
i guess i 'm just lucky to get a good working unit !
so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again .
hope to get my refund in a timely manner .
i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever .
it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes .
i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 .
my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .
i followed their advice but that failed , too .
that does n't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability .
i am very pleased with its quality and durability .
all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .
the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you .
i figured with a great first product and with this one having more features than the 600 i would buy one .
maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
as soon as i lifted the unit out of the box , i questioned my judgement .
many people recommended the ipod , and i borrowed one from a friend .
i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .
finally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing .
the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .
. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that .
the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv .
oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^
( batteries last longer too ! )
the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie " extras " on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that .
4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery 's out is not included , although one can be purchased separately .
meaning i do n't have to manually clear the list , and then load the new list .
no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad .
i repeat - do n't wast your money .
the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .
the mediasource itself was flaky ... crashing my explorer twice within the first hour ( the crash did n't require a reboot ) ... but after another reboot , it has n't crashed since .
. images taken indoor were n't so clear .
it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds .
so , if you read the instructions well , you should n't have any problems with this dvd unit .
after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all .
no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .
is my unit defective ?
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year " no questions asked " replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !
no issues as of yet
well to say , i had a very bad history with players .
anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix .
8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
now , i thought it 's time to upgrade .
my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .
overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .
granted this is cheaper than an ipod .
and really this is the best phone one could have .
small size .
* protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window .
it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .
i 've owned 6 or 7 dvd players since 1998 .
big mistake .
i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .
when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .
as i travelled internationally and did n't want to haul it back on a plane with me it was an expensive addition to the recycling bin .
when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .
nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .
i hope i have helped you continue to enjoy the apex dvd player with these troubleshooting tips .
i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines .
not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .
for the price and features it is really good .
so i do n't understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them .
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .
the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go .
i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally .
if you are planning to buy that player , do not !
i bought this as a gift for my sister .
an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper .
this will cause the discs not to show up together when you are looking for them on the nomad .
1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .
this thing does its job .
the dvd player just would't recognize them .
it focuses in a snap .
after messing with it at a store i noticed how bad the i-pod was .
pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
" when will my t-zones work ? " , csr :
this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
if you have the money and need 40 gb , this is the player for you .
a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .
i think most of you people complaining about no video is due to you hitting the wrong button either the p/n = pal / ntsc or the i/p is set to progressive scan .
oh my goodness --
if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books .
the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue .
this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .
i am really impressed by this dvd player .
when i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small .
people complain about the scroll wheel , but its not a big deal at all ( though it is just a little annoying at times ) .
i do n't really like bounce .
good thing i got a replacement plan .
usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it .
the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .
every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .
i received this as a gift .
the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key ) .
i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) .
however , it has failed to deliver on quality .
what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it .
lastly , the price is fantastic :
notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx .
in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this camera .
fact is , it could n't be easier to use .
do n't waste your time , engery , resources on this thing , just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod .
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units .
i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera .
once again , the sound is awesome , the batter life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life .
11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player
do n't get me wrong , the thing was like heaven for about a week .
it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
so consider what you 're going to use the device for .
i got the 40gb jukebox zen xtra for christmas .
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .
definetely a great camera .
creative is talking about updating it via firmware , however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players , looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates , not too much of new features .
i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one .
my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up .
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !
based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .
i bought this dvd player in november .
all i am looking for is a rebate form !
was it a full moon that night ?
now honestly , i love this player , but with all seriousness , i would not recommend it to other people , because of the breakdown flaw. and i honestly would not recomment the people of the ipod , that crap sucks big donkey ..... never mind .
my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .
overall i like the unit .
one bad thing though , i find the remote control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does .
reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item .
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player.for the first three hours , and then it died .
i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .
hopefully , this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod .
in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries .
nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality .
this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it .
i waited a few years between phones , mostly because ( like most i think ) i didnt really need one .
another stupid move .
the way to fix this is to rename the track by adding a number yourself to the end of the track listing .
it did also seem to have a strong " new electronics " smell for some time .
i can 't imagine why i would spend hundreds of dollars more to have an ipod .
this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .
this is one of those items that , at first glance , looked cool but did n't really ring a bell with me .
grandma in church quiet .
we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work " apex " dvd players and none worked .
karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity .
3 ) you must press the play button and hold it for a couple of seconds otherwise it will not work and you will think the whole unit is broken .
one thing puzzles me is that for " fine and 2200 + " quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .
the value , name , and resolution signed the lease .
size and style :
so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift .
overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .
difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say " difficult , " but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate .
with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet .
also , if you 're an audiophile , you 'll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short .
so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad .
anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix .
artist , album and genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player , and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory .
i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year .
before i decided to get this player , i did my research .
i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective .
well , this apex dvd player turned out great !
it makes the dvd player to switch between interlace mode and progressive scan mode .
an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into " out of battery " situation .
software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .
i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .
what kind of product goes out within a month ?
however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .
truly , i am quite impressed . . ! !
i have had this player for 2 weeks , i will be returning it for an exchange in the hopes that the locking problem and scroll wheel are problems with this particular unit .
i bought coolpix 4300 two months after i had bought canon powershot s400 .
there have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time , upon powering it up it starts on the " now playing " screen with a song or cd that i had been playing days before .
in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .
d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on
this is a great investment for someone like me who enjoys music and hates carrying multiple cds .
the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .
my 2.6 mhz pentium 4 with usb 2.0 was able to perform the task pretty quickly ( i would estimate ~ 5 - 8 minutes per cd ).
+ you can have different kind of lens if you want + flashes , etc.
hopefully you wo n't regret .
while it is true that it will stand on end , it is also easy to knock over that way .
the zen nx is $ 100 cheaper than the ipod of the same size , so you have to wonder just how much apple 's markup is anyway !
i love the storage in this thing .
i eventually gave up with customer support and worked on fixing the problem myself .
radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpiece in .
no way to contact their customer service .
features that would have been nice :
now i know why - they are pieces of junk .
the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones .
one thing that i found out recently is that you do n't need t-zones from tmobile to go online .
i did that and re-installed the software but had the same error .
the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .
working for 10 hours with it on " shuffle " totally rocks ! !
it do n't get any better then the nikon 4300 .
originally i wanted the ipod .
from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .
i enthusiastically recommend this camera .
the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click .
it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed-light settings .
connecting the same outputs to a video card in my computer , there was sound but still no picture .
8mb for a camera like this is a joke .
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying .
after two weeks the picture kept freezing .
i 've gotten used to it ( holding it in just the right realation to the ear , ducking into quieter places in bars ) but when others borrow it they 're shocked i can use it .
the reviews of this product can be roughly divided into two groups : ( 1 ) those who have had the product for a few weeks and ( 2 ) those have had the product for a few months .
depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .
the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers .
after reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common .
it actually gives the option to clear the previous playlist when i want to play another list .
on several different occasions it has displayed " no disc " with a disc inside .
the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool .
the reason for this the ipod has " a better user interface " .
now we come to the zen xtra .. .
personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice .
it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented .
then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .
the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .
the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .
they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .
i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :
i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime .
noiseless , light weight and oh yeah .
i 'd have given it 5 stars , but i 'm waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one :
i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time .
8 battery life is excellent .
the p/n button switches your dvd players video output signal between pal and ntsc .
the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .
the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .
poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .
thought i 'd weigh in here with my stats .
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .
it can get pretty lonely out there .
you have to buy better ones .
it says i have a harddisk problem .
it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .
cheaper to produce , holds a lot , heavier and has moving parts which means it 's a little more prone to damage from being banged around .
the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .
i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .
still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !
i guess you get what you pay for .
i was able to return it to the retailer where i bought it and got a replacement .
i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .
the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering !
the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad .
back to the 2600 :
finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me !
for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .
great phone .. .
this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler .
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .
no more annoying series of beeps .
i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !
after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends , i bought this nokia 6610 .
you 're talking totally different hardware .
save money on the long run - buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month .
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .
the sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with .
when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff .
well , it was nice while it lasted .
my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months .
you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though .
if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for .
with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet .
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house , that one didn " t work either !
they play just about everything , but # 2 and # 3 died very shortly after getting them .
its great .
even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .
sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .
drop if just a few inches on a hard surface and the faceplate pops off ( but not if it 's in its case ) .
it 's a shame , but mine is going back .
this required patience as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it ( which i could do with my flash player ) .
i could crush this thing in half with two fingers if i wanted to .
the battery life is amazing .
with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it .
it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !
i am averaging 4.5 mb per song , to give you an idea of how many songs you can get by the amount of memory .
recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
there 's a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330 , especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures .
overall , a good buy for the price .
on my relatively new computer ( p4 with windows xp and usb 2.0 ) , the os complained about the installation of the drivers .
i love this player .
navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .
how does it sound ?
b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .
which means that in trying to save a few hundred dollars , i 'll end up spending more than twice that .
if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe .
but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .
the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .
a tons of reveiws has reported this problem and the same here .
i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering .
to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )
this camera has a major design flaw .
what is up .
buyer beware ! sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly ( maybe this applies to other players too , and not just the nomad , i do n't know ) .
the dvd player does not work properly .
regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop .
it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket .
the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .
i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend .
notmad worked right away after install and it is what i would like to see from the product .
a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .
a great buy .
they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy .
as i emailed to the the customer service department , the only thing this player has done consistantly is use enought electricity to keep the red led burning .
i am a business user who heavily depend on mobile service .
and does n't need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does .
i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now .
depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models .
5 hours max. i did it like this
3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players
basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n't used .
bought this player after reading the reviews here which identify it as reading most formats including dvd + rw 's and vcd 's .
i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !
but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture .
so far so good , no problems , no conversions .
battery life is good for a phone of this size .
perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy " off " brands .
lot 's of other features that i need to find out about .
they told me i would have to connect to my laptop , which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email .
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
