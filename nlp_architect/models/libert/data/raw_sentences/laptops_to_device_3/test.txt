if it were not for that i would have given it 4 .
it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .
another point of note : the battery life is incredible !
added 2-24 .
in fact , everyone who saw it thought i was " the man " and wo n't believe i returned it .
if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .
after the first one fatally crashed , the replacement did not work .
i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .
overall this is a slightly better than average phone .
it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs .
some dvd 's i rented would not play .
carry your entire collection !
even if there happened to be identical track titles on the same disc , you could still edit the file name manually and get them both onto the player .
my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .
like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels .
ok , that happens , so i try to skip the chapter .
it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .
is it a coincidence that i no longer can get any of your nomad zen xtras ( worst name ever ) at best buy and now the 60gb nomad xtra is " sold out " or more likely " discontinued " at the almighty amazon.com ?
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .
my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of .
what more could you ask for .
i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra .
as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .
the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box .
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting .
bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations .
overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !
1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .
the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .
however , if anyone has participated in violent or extreme sports while using their zen , please share your experiences .
if the music had been on my home computer , the transfer would have been accomplished very quickly .
his i-pod can only play for a couple of hours with a fully recharging now .
since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .
no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .
well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players .
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies .
i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me .
picture this :
if you watch dvds once in a while like i do , get this !
want the laundry list of reasons why ?
i 've picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful .
so far , however , i 'm a very happy customer .
i do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand .
its quiet .
i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .
after that it seems like you 're on your own .
the included earbuds were uncomfortable .uncomfortable -1
the first one we installed did n't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least .
the software , mediasource , cannot work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) .
this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .
the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .
in manual , you can set it to " single af " where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features .
so far i 've only had it since christmas , so i cant tell you much about the battery life .
and then it breaks .
i didnt wait to experiment .
the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .
almost half what an ipod would cost you !
the prints are beautiful !
navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .
short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .
it also has an optical out , which it should .
most of the dvds i was trying were fairly new and were in great condition .
since the ipod lacks this review feature on its auto-sync and it only allows one-way transfers , the first time i connected my ipod to my laptop , i wiped out the 20gb of music i had transferred from my desktop to the ipod .
bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent .
i needed something with more power , so i bought a nikon coolpix 4300 .
i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily .
now , i suddenly have no picture .
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything .
+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .
i originally purchase a 30 gb nomad zen xtra as a portable mp3 player .
i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .
if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .
the pros :
in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered .
the technology is finally here folks , to make your photo life easier .
3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze .
get it , it 's woth every penny ! !
this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver .
when i turned eax off the static disappeared .
the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !
my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again .
anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it .
a dock is unnecessary as the charger and usb cable do the necessary .
manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
we got a 256mb card , and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend .
they refunded my $ $ $ so fast and paid for the shipping back .
i changed video cables , tried connecting to tv on input1 and input2 but no help .
that 's a huge difference ... especially in this price range .
to say the least , i was horribly dissatisified with my service with sprint , which was why t-mobile was so fantastically refreshing .
6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .
nokia does not disappoint in this model .
i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name .
i treat the battery well and it has lasted .
my last mp3 player 's screen drove me nuts .
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
it 's almost like having a media player / file manager built into the dvd player .
most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy .
i find this to be a great feature .
hope someone else has better luck !
so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out .
no matter the format .
i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .
well , not with this one .
first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .
but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .
cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .
i am a soldier serving in baghdad right now .
the g2 was better in this respect .
this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .
a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included .
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver .
it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .
will never purchase apex again .
5 . the zen does not have a stop button !
i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem .
the visceral teases include the case , the sound quality , and the capacity .
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .
i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .
note : this will add about $ 30 to the price to purchase , but worth it
autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .
besides user error ( surprise , surprise ) , it 's hard to imagine people having trouble with either .
that way i could keep it in the case all the time .
it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .
i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any product ) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes .
it 's nothing major , just a bad hard drive , any hard drive mp3 player can have that problem .
this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cdr / cdrw / dvdr / dvdrw , and of course plays dvd movies from uk. i love the aiff , progressive scan feature .
p.s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ?
the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .
this is my fourth mp3 player ( creative nomad jukebox2 and 3 , rio chie , and this one ) , and my third player from creative .
if you have a question , they have the answer .
the dvd player is fine .
i intend to contact the company , but from what i 've read .
this model has come down in price since i purchased mine .
i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .
some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .
1 ) fm receiver - some models out there have this .
if you have windows me you should upgrade to xp anyway , lol .
for the most part this is a good dvd player .
as mentioned above i broke the player within the 1st 10 days .
bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .
another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on .
so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine .
great price .
had this been my only dvd player , though , it would have been a real problem .
( good going , amazon ).
i got an rma from creative , sent my player in to them for repairs .
i can 't simply bring up my entire list of songs , click play , and then hit next .
this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .
the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage .
the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day ( although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life ) .
very large pics take 8mb each !
the device is larger than an ipod of similar capacity .
structurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you .
what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies .
i am new to the whole digital camera thing ; well , new to the whole camera thing period , really .
cons summary :
- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .
many reviewers say the faceplate simply did n't fit well so they returned the zen .
every t-mobile plan comes with gsm data , meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps ( with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference ) .
i have a large collection of cds and have loaded over 100 of them so far .
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .
another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine .
however , the ad-2600 does n't have this feature ( for now ) .
i can 't comment on the quality of the audio , because it was back at the store before i ripped a single cd .
i would replace them with some better sounding and more comfortable phones .
first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds .
so what ?
also , it was only $ 39.99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player .
when i hit " menu " it told me , " playback only . "
the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat . clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .
the software you get with this camera is perfect .
if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !
and also , it 's priced very affordably .
after having had my heart broken by a sexy piece of hardware that simply would n't perform .
i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .
i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty . ( it 's fast too ! )
use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run .
besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !
when plugged in , it does n't lag the computer like the archos did ... unless you are doing a massive transfer of data in one load .
the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons .
using the remote control , press the i/p button located on the bottom right corner of the remote .
if you want the other accessories the ipod offer , maybe that 's where you should go .. .
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .
i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer , and then transfer them to a friend 's .
in the last month i bought the apex ad-1600 and the ad-1220 .
one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like .
it happened to me once .
even better , ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap .
if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed , i would rate this a 5 star machine .
of course , unlike that person i will mention that i upgraded the firmware to 1.23 . 00. but i did transfer files before the upgrade without problem too .
got a great deal from a reputable seller .
this is extemely lame .
it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there .
getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows " no disc . "
if this is your fist dvd player .
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .
so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one .
there was very little light in there .
the upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions .
sure it 's " old school " to carry a cd wallet around , but it will be easier to manage and i 'll save around 250 bucks .
anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 .
i have a 128mb card in it and can shoot over 150 hi res photos .
but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .
often i fill i need to have better organization for the library and there is not enought of variables .
plugged it in .
most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera .
and how can i do that ... .
this is pretty cool .
my first player ( model ad-500a ) went into the trash about 6 months after i bought it .
i 've been using it for about 3 months now .
the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling .
battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours .
i have n't tried setting up any playlists yet so i can 't comment on any problems there .
you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly .
for me , that was the only drawback .
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e. , mp3s ) .
however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !
the plus points are -
the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .
i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with " bass boost . "
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .
nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes , medium; compact size , price , brand name , good software that is included and previous reviews .
the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .
it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .
i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player .
gee ... thanks a lot creative .
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !
player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play .
apex sucks !
this is the 4 apex player that i have bought .
just get some new headphones and your set .
and i am hoping the static i heard when using eax was a blip ...
i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .
but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose .
also , very light and portable .
the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .
i called them twice and both times they said it is " about to ship " .
even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio .
if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .
i bought this last week through amazon .
while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .
set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week .
the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel
find another phone , or buy this one in its manufacturer-unlocked form .
a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on " normal " resolution .
get one now !
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .
i only have one question , when i add tracks to my nomad , via nomad explorer , they are automatically put in alphebetical order , rather than album order .
the mini ipod 's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there 's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage .
like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product .
but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .
-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .
even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them .
replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 .
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n't had any problems .
those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
overall , i highly recommend this phone .
obviously there is no composite video output and different analog audio signals at progressive scan mode .
if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 !
only used for 3 month before it 's down !
i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .
do yourself a favor and save your money to get something of better quality , or at least works .
i had apex regular ( non-progressive ) dvd-player for two years .
first of all i have been a big nokia fan and have been upgrading my cell phones about once a year ( right after the release contract is over ) .
( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .
it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .
focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
i made an additional five attempts at creating a playlist , before packing the unit up and heading over to amazon 's product return page .
otherwise , this player is awesome !
i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .
this is the third apex dvd i bought .
let 's face it - when you want to watch a movie you want to see a picture .
the image quality is excellent .
the features are really cool like the radio .
of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest .
it 's worth it .
i set the camera to the " manual " mode for one main reason :
zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough .
downloads are a snap and quick .
the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .
i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive .
finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .
one broke , one got stolen , and then i bought the riovolt sp - 350 .
you will find it very hard or impossible to get you money back .
it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .
it worked good for a while .
the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good .
the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera , which i do agree .
i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
i am still trying to resolve the problem with the second one .
any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor , along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support .
not just the transfer software ( which was a hellishly horrible experience ) but also the player 's software .
unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds. even though they were not damaged in any way .
friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased .
. this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped .
5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .
if only it played stand alone avi files .
one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .
4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying .
pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry .
the software , which comes with player is not good at all .
the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .
do n't buy this player .
subsequent behavior even worse .
on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured .
now what about the flash problem ?
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .
the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance .
the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .
this is nothing new , every mp3 player , memory card , etc. , used for digital media today has some kind of preloaded operating software on it .
i just sold my archos 20gb jukebox recorder after not being satisfied with it 's slow loading & difficult navigation , not to mention it froze quite a bit .
that 's all for now .
having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers .
i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) .
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking .
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .
the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .
great screen and great sound .
my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .
it did lock up on me a couple of times .
having to copy / delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage .
apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r/rw and another supports - r/rw ) .
it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates .
once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located .
i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast .
9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .
we got a familyplan from t-mobile which saves us tons .
i think a $ 39 dissapointment is better then a $ 125 dissapointment !
f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course
very simple to use .
they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it .
2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow .
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .
the vibration is not top .
anyone looking for more than " point and shoot " can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .
scroll bar :
excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems .
on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good .
compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck .
my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands .
the biggest drawback that people have about the zen xtra is the software .
like most people , i do n't want to read the instructions , i just want to use it .
( throw a cell phone and you 're asking for trouble . ) 3a .
i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .
if it does , ill give up .
for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .
i am bored with the silver look .
if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later .
you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .
i suppose that you could jog with it but it seems to be made for the enjoyment of music .
both creative and third-party powered speakers work great , as do third-party wireless transmitters .
this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags .
i was trying to decide whether or not i should go with the 40 gb ipod or this 30 gb zen xtra .
the controls definately took some getting used to .
case - the nomad comes with a leather holding case .
i purchased this player last week .
i ordered two of these puppies for christmas gifts .
yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .
i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it !
using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account .
after i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't .
some of the more geeky ( non-apple type ) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface .
it really does n't make any cents $ $ to build a great reputation then destroy it from lack a research and testing in one season .
since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make .
nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .
the downside though , may be a big one for you .
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds .
great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.
the second one is up and running .
now i can transport files to friends house with ease .
i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media .
im taking mine back tomorrow morning , and getting a nice shiny new ipod instead .
despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography .
i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) .
crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time .
whatever you do , do n't buy this product .
this is the best dvd player i 've purchased .
. go ; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card .
when it arrives , you press the shutter release .
first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .
this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket .
the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use .
what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses .
the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .
strike 1 .
no-one mentions whether there is a stop button , but the photos do n't show one .
i bought the player this week and i like it by far .
i replaced it with this not-quite-so-dazzling , but definitely more functional device .
what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
unfortunately it turns out to be the " disposable " type .
the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .
i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy .
one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent .
eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs ( reviewers figures )
i was cruising around the device within 20 minutes .
apex 's website is down and they wo n't answer their phone .
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .
i was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base .
* removable battery
win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs .
if you can live without an integrated camera , you wo n't miss much more .
i 've tried several dvd 's and even new ones do the same thing .
you can also delete songs from the player itself , and create playlists - on the fly - on your player .
the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .
i have n't figured it out yet .
when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture !
i 've had no problems with the software .
i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable ( 49.99 @ nokiausa.com or t-mobile.com ) press dial up on my laptop ( by the way it is a mac pb 1gz. and in a matter of seconds i can access my email , fax , and the entire web from my truck !
and we all know about the rush to market on new products .
but the earbuds suck !
- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .
that 's a rare and valuable feature .
i made the mistake of thinking i could easily manage my mp3 library with this device .
output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv .
yes , the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late , but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium ( unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe ) .
final verdict :
but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
so buy the g3 .
touchups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct .
the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend .
the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .
now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos .
worth every penny !
however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .
perhaps there is a way around this delay .
i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones .
4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed .
i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work .
yes , i recommend it over the competition .
other than that this thing is great ...
overall design :
it only took me about 10 seconds to transfer a 200mb file .
the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc .
the i/p button switches the tv display between interlace and progressive .
software : for the people who complain about software , please , stop complaining .
this is ridiculous .
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain .
however , i should have followed my instincts :
it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .
a disipointed customer .
if you 're investing in a camera at this level , buy this software !
i 'd look elsewhere .
so i do n't know what the previous review that could n't do more than 30 songs is talking about .
after investigating a multitude of player options , i asked for and received the 60 gb zen xtra for christmas .
this phone plays up to 4 tones at one time and it actually sounds like music .
anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception .
loved the slim design .
so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )
i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch widescreen dvd 's to normal .
the " scene " mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a " regular " setting .
after a lot of research , i decided on the g3 .
this junky is super duper rad. it be my fav c-phone and stuff .
different people have different needs , of course , but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive .
- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .
what 's going on creative labs ?
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll .
the less computer-saavy might find apple 's software a bit friendlier , though ( i use it at a friend 's house and it does do a lot more for you . )
i was surprised by t-mobile 's service .
oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy .
i purchased and returned this product , but not because of any glaring flaws in the design .
i definately recommend a large memory card .
the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .
it 'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it .
great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
i am enjoying my phone a lot ....
after using it for a few weeks ( the amount of time before the hard drive crashed ) it revealed a few of its shortcommings .
pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent .
while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .
if you have any doubts about this player , well do n't .
third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .
i purchased the apex 2600 after reading good reviews of it , both here and in other places .
you need the remote control for this so you better get it from your dog before he burries it in the backyard .
or save time and just do it , you wo n't regret it .
it referred to a " microsoft jet database engine " error and the install program suggested i download a service pack from the ms website to fix the problem ;
it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video .
loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well .
as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .
( but as any hard drive , all of them freeze at certain points )
you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .
this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records .
i am still trying to resolve it four months later .
also , i downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates .
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .
- uploading music is quick and easy .
also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore " the " when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .
after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for .
if i knew then what i know now i would have paid the extra to get an ipod & avoided the zen .
the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap .
i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time .
all of the zens use a standard notebook drive .
huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .
if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .
this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !
through the software you can classify songs in genres .
that said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory .
yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .
i bought this player during a christmas sale at an excellent price .
none of these are perfect .
their website does not show it as a compatible phone , and should i try to access the game downloads on t-zones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported .
the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !
one minor complaint :
i can do that myself .
but i would expect that , since my movie discs have all played with no problem , the extras discs would , too , without any additional tweaking .
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .
i have 100 of my cd 's transferred and have n't made a dent in the 30 gb drive .
and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness .
the price compared to the ipod is great .
the movie mode is also working great .
i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .
they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .
another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 " or 5x7 " prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 " photos once in a while .
the screen 's large and easily read .
installed software .
get those mp3s off your hard drive , save space , and enjoy your massive music library .
i cancelled the order .
it also has unproven battery life .
the most important thing for me is sound quality .
do n't walk , run and buy this camera if you have the budget , i guarantee you will not be disappointed .
it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .
if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 !
the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's " notmad " software because of some advanced features i wanted .
apple 's solution - pay apple another $ 400 + for a new ipod ( less a paltry discount ) .
i then installed the software manually instead , after having to click past about 5 windows of " please register with us so we can spam your inbox " .
it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !
it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture .
i thought it would be haggard but when i be gotted this junky i was mad happy and stuff .
one still works fine , the other quit after one day .
however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .
30gb is more than enough for most people .
hope this review has helped you in making up your mind .
purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it .
3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
it 's bigger , but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it 's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods .
as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .
recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .
apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .
however , it serves its purpose .
that is a major minus , but its not that bad .
in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it .
although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
i currently have ~ 1100 songs encoded mostly at 196 kpbs and i have n't even used 10gb of storage yet .
pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?
( i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead ) .
if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty .
come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones .
pro : 1 .
overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .
i agree with the positive reviews .
enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
my first impression was positive .
i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !
now where did i put that manual ?
this would have been much easier .
it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .
all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .
amazon was supposed to send me another one , but did n't and sent me a gift certificate instead ( i 'm guessing because the price has gone up on this unit since december ).
ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .
i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out .
a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names .
it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do .
you can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions .
the battery life on this phone is surreal .
although you may think you 're dealing with amazon , you 're dealing with some second rate store that you 've never heard of .
take my words and give it a try .
i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still can 't get a video signal from the machine .
the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .
the fact that the " 0 " key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the " # " key instead .
if you buy the stereo headset , you will enjoy it much more .
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial . its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )
the door would not close .
these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .
it takes great pictures .
however , the creative software is not real intuitive .
here 's something you have to know before you considering about buying this one .
just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city / exchange you wanted .
surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .
my sister has this series of phone and she loves the radio and headset .
unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it .
i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive .
now , for the t-mobile service :
by the way my alias dvds are legit too not no bootleg from the internet .
i think this is it 's biggest flaw .
seriously ! i love it !
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty .
go for it !
just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .
speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .
i believe the napster mp3 player has this feature .
after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures .
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine .
i wanted to use the nomad with a cassette style car adapter .
the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .
as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you wont scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys .
i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .
it 's easy .
and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .
none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers - you cannot make changes on the ipod that are premanent .
you can even skip that step and rip them directly from the cd to the player .
price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .
i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .
the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly
redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more !
it would just spin up and stop , and display " no disc " .
the grain was terrible .
i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .
i guess that i can not complain since it does not actually claim to play vcd / svcd formats , but others say they can .
i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .
making the step from film to digital has been a great move .
- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last .
you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .
i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes .
but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes .
it practically plays almost everything you give it .
if you have always on internet or are logged into the internet you can use the feature that will download the album & song id information ( this is a free service ) with the click of a button .
really quiet .
unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks .
with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .
fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice .
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
which was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone ...
it costs like 200 dollars to replace - now you mail it off to get the battery replaced for like 99 .. .
otherwise , you 'll have to mess around a lot with filenames inside the ( decent ) nomad explorer , which is not fun at all .
also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy .
what the hell is wrong with this thing .
my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity .
i had no problems following their installation instructions .
i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .
the cd just has too many problems with win xp .
i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price .
it took maybe 15 minutes to transfer 1000 songs .
the light auto-correction is awesome .
huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you .
the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses !
the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal .
be advised , however , that you may encounter problems .
overall it is the best camera on the market .
i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode .
bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better .
to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press " menu " on the remote while the dvd is playing .
i would recommend this product to anyone .
the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .
i have a dvd burner .
player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 .
many of our disney movies do n't play on this dvd player .
overall i like it .
this dvd play is basicly junk .
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .
because , you will be dissapointed .
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .
try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems .
i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of " juice " .
it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .
it always pays off .
if you 're like me , that will definitely make you pause .
the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .
did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution .
the phones are awesome .
you have to add all the songs to a play list .
ipod has no stop button ; when new users mention this ipod veterans call it " unnecessary " and " so 20th century " .
while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that , an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it .
size - bigger than the ipod
always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .
sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod .
the top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable .
compusa , memorex , fuji .
four megapixels is great .
for me , i 'll save that cash for another purchase .
it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .
i do recommend getting the data kit for those geeks .
but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there .
so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .
i would recommend replacing the existing software with the " notmad explorer , " which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .
there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk !
buy this for the storage and price , avoid it if you know nothing about computers .
sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .
before anyone says hey you have n't used the product , i have , my friend received one for christmas instead of an ipod and has since envied me for my vastly superior product .
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user-friendly player imo .
remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons .
creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery .
about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc .
the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .
unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed .
it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .
although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint .
bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price .
the screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it .
there 's a dent on the upper-back-right and lower-back-right corners ... not too obvious unless you 're up close .
door broke after a month .
also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .
i bought my nikon coolpix4300 about a week ago .
2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
before they are sold out !
itunes does what apple is famous for , makes software that works for the less computer saavy .
after much research i decided on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
now my dissapointments .
but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !
btw , be sure to have your mp3 tags labled correctly , as this will ensure a great organization .
just before we all spent a couple weeks in an rv together .
so far not going to get a good review .
cleaned the dvd , tried again , no luck .
i 'd recommend against this unit .
you have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to , instead of just connecting it with a usb connection .
also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .
2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .
sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .
i searched on the internet and found one tip which solved our problem : press i/p button on the remote control .
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .
maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again .
the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .
forget about it .
nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .
also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 " tv ).
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .
amazon , do your customers a big favor , do n't carry this item , and give them refunds !
a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer .
my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .
i think the reson for the creative being larger is for sound dampening and protection , whihc is a plus , but then again it is only speculation .
well that is not true .
the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use .
but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it !
they sent me a new ad2600 with the same problem .
got a " system error " problem 30 days after purchase .
creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static .
whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together .
i 'm not sure why people have problems with either the interface of the nomad , or the software that comes with the unit .
i was n't sure how long it would take before it would break .
typically people use 96kbs to 320 kps.
i am quite happy with the camera .
overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .
i listened to it for several days before needing to recharge them .
things that i 'd prefer different - there 's a red light that shines when it 's turned off !
each of the 4 lasted less than six months .
software - the software is crap .
i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos !
when the previous versions of the zens were shipped with musicmatch , people had this problem because musicmatch creates both sets of tags , which seem to confuse the zen xtra .
2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .
the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .
only con i can think of is no camera ... .
not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want .
i currrently have service with t-mobile , verizon , and t-mobile .
you get what you pay for .
only one disk played through to completion successfully .
this gap allowed the front panel to fly off after barely being touched .
and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey !
that 's probably a bad thing .
i like to play my music by album and the nomad jukebox plays the songs in the same order as the actual cd .
i just used the explorer program to move my songs to my player .
when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .
the radio feature has superb sound quality .
the longest that i have n't charged it was maybe 3 days and that 's turning it off every now and then .
the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too .
it lasted about 1 1/2 weeks .
the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .
i was a little disappointed in the low end .
that is where my satisfaction ends .
when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good !
the build quality feels solid , it does n't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd5.1 sound good ) .
size and weight :
i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .
flash card memory vs. hard drive ( i.e. why does a 256 mb player cost $$$...and a 40 gb ( 40,000 mb ) player only cost
this explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players .
the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .
this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure .
we did n't get to use it again for over a month ( sad , i know ) .
after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us .
i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it .
9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .
when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .
however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .
the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .
unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs .
i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept .
do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype .
spend the extra 20 $ and buy a name brand dvd player .
accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .
i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player .
the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better .
i did buy separate headphones as other have recommended .
and should they not know it , they can find it out pretty quick .
you will be sorry if you do .
this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ).
well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .
it goes nicely with my apex 27 " in my bedroom .
i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .
i was , however .
this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas .
you can get weather , movies , horoscopes and more with a few clicks .
i 've had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola , sony ericsson , nokia etc. ) and in my opinion , nokia has the best menus and promps hands down .
bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it .
i like the speakphone function a lot .
reading other reviews , i do n't think the replacement one will be any better .
anyway , the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago - you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product .
that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty .
i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all .
the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .
i did have some problems figuring out how to turn the unit on , but creative did a good job with this , as they had a clearly labled " on " button that i found when i left my cellar for the first time in years .
highly recommended .
you will be told goldstar codes work , and you will be told zenith codes will work , and radio shack will give you apex codes but they will not work .
night mode is clear as day .
however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .
i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box .
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :
silverish color really adds a special touch .
zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .
" enjoy " !
the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .
i give it 10 stars !
unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box .
the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .
a. the cddb downloads information for the cd that you insert such that you do not have to type in the track information such as album , artist , song title , etc.
rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc.
i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price .
personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more .
with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .
getting files onto it is quick and painless .
two months ago , an internal part failed ( not due to customer abuse ; it just failed ) .
from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles .
yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway .
bought two ad2600 's for christmas .
if i wasnt a runner i would take a bullet in the foot for my nomad jukebox .
i call apex customer service and they told me that there is a known problem with the model playing disney and other movies and that it is not there problem so i 'm stuck with a new dvd player that wo n't play my kids disney movies .
buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem ..
do n't let my five star rating fool you .
most of our emplyees use this model phone .
i received this dvd player free with the purchase of a palm tungsten e from officemax .
fair warning - do not buy .
what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy .
not a big hassle as many would have you think .
now i need to buy myself another one !
i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .
it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .
do n't be pulled in by the great price -- you get what you pay for , and there 's a reason this model is so cheap .
the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk .
still no response .
i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 .
i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures .
i chose the canon speedlite 420 .
accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .
there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .
i particularly like the " txt " file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take .
i do n't think so .
here were my requirements in a digital camera :
i think it fell right on the earphone plug when it fell ( murphy strikes again ) .
in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .
bought the apex ad-2600 from amazon in 12/03 mainly on price , $ 49.99 - $ 10 rebate = $ 39.99 .
sent mine back .
. lens cap is a really annoying
the sound quality is very good .
duplicates are a no brainer and cheap .
also the ipod has games on it .
apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy .
in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play .
i did everything i could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader .
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .
i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs , which is an unaccustomed luxury , even with t-mobile service .
i have been assured this will be fixed soon .
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .
one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched !
people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone .
negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .
hopefully you still have the remote control .
amazon.com promptly refunded my money for the first one , because a replacement was not available ( thanks amazon.com !
also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .
feels solid in hand .
this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi .
i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner .
1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision .
i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .
the zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced .
i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .
this problem vanished after the first month , so i assume it was a temporary dust issue .
i did n't had any problem till now .
great job canon !
having said that , this is what you do . " add to cart " !
i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .
typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .
there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free .
a remote would have been cool too ... but lets not push it .
however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players .
it wo n't play all of my movies .
would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .
this phone is a winner ...
before jumping on the ipod train , take a look at this marvel .
plays them all .
for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer .
progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) .
the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
i 've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual .
when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .
sound quality :
this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .
it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .
i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .
sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 .
the ipod also does not let you see what 's coming up next on the player .
some of my friends had well branded dvd-players but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks !
audio on video also lacking .
when the player was working it was great ,but .
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .
because of the large capacity of the nomad , owners can load hundreds of cds on to it .
navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard .
i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .
all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .
nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .
it has many great features and very few bad ones .
i do hope that they offer more faceplate options .
i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .
the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough .
good quality video .
furher it contains a card reader , a flash card folder for up to 8 cards , a lense cleaning rag , and an ac adapter , which is very helpful when working in an " outlet environment " .
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .
the buttons and interface are very easy to use .
now let 's talk about the software .
now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk .
c. i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer .
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player .
ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1.1 usb ) .
- light , compact design
it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves .
a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .
here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of " plastic-like " ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera .
3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .
i will just say this :
you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do .
i purchased a jukebox 3 from creative almost a year ago .
do not recommend .
forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds.
with our compact 35mm broken , and a vacation in europe at hand , i finally decided to enter the digital age .
at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast !
the canon g3 .
so now i 've got to call their customer " service " ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back .
i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting .
i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it !
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
if you are going to need a player that is rugged this may not be the one for you .
by what time standards -- martian ?
