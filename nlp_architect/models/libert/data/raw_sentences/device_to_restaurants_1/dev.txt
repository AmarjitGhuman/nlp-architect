Just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday .
The exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations .
The food was very good , but not very thai .
Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers , no matter what the reviews say .
Our waiter was helpful and charming , the food was perfect , and the wine was good , too .
The BEST Chinese food Uptown !
the food was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining .
And the staff is also young , energeic and hot !!!!
I go twice a month !
This place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area .
Plus they made a perfect martini .
Dessert is a joke ... dont bother
The unfortunate lady next to us thought she had ordered a salad ( including asking for salad dressing ) and was instead given a quesedilla .
I 'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service .
( Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer !!!
Do n't judge this place prima facie , you have to try it to believe it , a home away from home for the literate heart .
Oh yes , and they lie on the phone , claiming they have seating in the garden , then of course the seats are not available .
The dinner was ok , nothing I would have again .
All the money went into the interior decoration , none of it went to the chefs .
We were less than impressed .
( 2 ) egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of Mott street just south of Canal .
This is my fourth try over a two year period , and I 'm done .
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian .
We love the food , drinks , and atmosphere !
I recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great .
Both were very good , but nothing you could n't get at similar restaurant .
My friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatos .
The foie gras was sweet and luscious .
Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS !
Only complaint would be that at an average cost of $ 12 - $ 15 per meal , I 'd like not to have to worry about finding a seat !
The service is spotty , sometimes really friendly and sometimes barely there .
We bring in a party of ten or so every week .
I highly recommend the fish tacos , everything else was ok .
The sake menu should not be overlooked !
Service was prompt and courteous .
The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome , great appetizer to share !
It 's not mind-blowing , but to me , thai food never is and never will be .
Great food , great decor , great service .
Really cool stauff inside .
Great staff .
I think this would be a pretty good spot if it were not so overpriced and overrated .
I have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .
Filled with suits , though , so you never really feel terribly comfortable .
First of all , this place is * not * romantic , as claimed by Citysearch 's editorial review .
We do not need to go to a four-star restaurant anymore .
So , again , give it a try .
I have known about this secret for the last 13 years , Emilio ( the Godfather ) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices .
We saw them heating up at least one frozen item though I 'm not sure which dim sum dish it was .
So all I 'm trying to say is this restaurant is by far the best thai food restaurant I 've ever been to .
One should not go to Lucky Strike for the food .
They pray to their Food Gods to make them into a good pizza like VT 's .
Yamato is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi , or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much .
Its located in greenewich village .
I just had my first visit to this place and ca n't wait to go back and slowly work my way through the menu .
The food was good overall .
He always says , I do n't have customers .
Great wine , great food .
Haru serves very fresh fish , has a trendy , modern ambiance , prime location on Park Avenue South and friendly service .
Not a large place , but it 's cute and cozy .
and you ca n't beat the prices .
Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you .
Tables are close , so you better be comfortable bumping elbows with other patrons .
We were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry .
Searching to get out from the cold , freezing weather , we went into what we thought was a deli .
My husband and I have been sold on this from the first visit .
Only complaint is the pricing -- I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .
Not worth the prices .
Even the pasta is delicious here ( a rarity in New York pizza restaurants ) .
It is simply amazing .
Shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here : simple contract , deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20 .
The waiters are very friendly and helpful and if you frequent they will remember you .
Also , do n't plan on asking for your favorite roll , if it 's not on the menu , you ca n't have it .
This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money .
Terrible , terrible management - deserves to be shut-down .
Service was prompt , friendly and great .
The service is always great , and the owner walks around to make sure you enjoy .
I never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it .
After dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : Where are you from ... maybe you dont know how things work in America ... and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on .
skip dessert .
Largest and freshest pieces of sushi , and delicious !
I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try .
Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey .
There are other Vietnamese restaurants in the chinatown area and you can forget about those .
I expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu .
Try the tandoori salmon !
One of my Fav spots in the city .
I love this place !
Price no more than a Jersey deli but way better .
The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing !
I have to say they have one of the fastest delivery times in the city .
The bibimbap was average , but the stone bowl was n't even close to sizzling .
I honestly do n't even know where to begin .
Without the wait or attitude , I would probably go back , but there are just too many other restaurants in Brooklyn that are as good or better and do n't make me jump through hoops .
You guys are awesome !
My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it .
Aside from the Sea Urchin , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail , Boton Shrimp , Blue Fin Torro ( Fatty Tuna ) , Sea Eel , etc .
The rest of the menu is limited by everything is good eats .
The pizza was really good .
Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers , no matter what the reviews say .
People dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans .
The most annoying thing , though , is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue .
I would recommend to ask for a bigger sitting area when you make a reservation ( if possible )
Prices are in line .
if you 're daring , try the balsamic vinegar over icecream , it 's wonderful !
With so many good restaurants on the UWS , I do n't need overpriced food , absurdly arrogant wait-staff who do n't recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy service , and management that does n't care .
The food was just OK , at least for what food was available .
great eats , good times .
Not too crazy about their sake martini .
- i asked for them spicy and they were delicious ) .
When we notified him that he did n't mention the specials , he did n't apologize but let us know that we made a very good decision regardless .
Have been several times and it never dissapoints .
Really , I find it rather scandalous that such a crappy restaurant attracts such crowds -- this , in the city of a million restaurants , at least 9/10 of which are way better than this one .
The food is wonderful , artfully done and simply delicious .
If you 're not familiar with the cuisine , you may encounter problems ordering here and be sure to bring plenty of cash with you as they do n't accept credit cards .
Ess-A-Bagel ( either by Sty-town or midtown ) is by far the best bagel in NY .
The comments about fried foods is correct ( below ) but the other dishes , including the lamb entree and many of the salads ( avocado shrimp ) were quite good .
moral stay away .
They 're terrific !!
We also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka .
i would recommend reservations on weekends though .
I did not try the caviar but I tried their salmon and crab salad ( they are all good )
I love Indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it .
However , it is jus too good to not praise it .
Too many other good places to have to settle .
Its good to go there for drinks if you do n't want to get drunk because you 'll be lucky if you can get one drink an hour the service is so bad .
Decent Thai food in cute - though a bit dank - little Nolita hangout , BUT service terrible .
Plus , when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy Saturday night , the owner sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over !
It 's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early .
Their coffee is quite good too !
None of that yucky whipped stuff .
Not only is the cuisine the best around , the service has always been attentive and charming .
P.S. Please do n't tell anyone in my family i eat there .
The food is great .
It was pretty inexpensive too .
I 'm no food critic , but I 'd like to think I have a tiny bit of experience under my belt having lived in NY for the last 11 years .
Have a mojito and sit in the back patio .
They do n't walk around with the trays of Dim Sum .
When we arrived at 6:00 PM , the restaurant was practically empty .
IT WAS HORRIBLE .
They have it all -- great price , food , and service .
I 've been to Sotto Voce several time , and I have to say this one place that hits the nail right on the head ever time !
Still , any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house ...
Ive been to many Thai restaurants in Manhattan before , and Toons is by far the best Thai food Ive had ( except for my mom 's of course ) .
I have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a mushroom consomme - and this chef accomplishes without fats .
go to any corned indian restaurant , and the little india strip along east 6 st rules supreme !
When I saw that their website had a link to da Ciro in Napoli , I knew there was going to be good pizza !
We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods .
I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night .
My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it .
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date .
The manager then told us we could order from whatever menu we wanted but by that time we were so annoyed with the waiter and the resturant that we let and went some place else .
If you are in a big group , this place is perfect because it recomends sharing - they have lazy susans on most tables - even families can feel comfortable here .
The entrees were served with miso soup and rice .
First the wrong bread came out with the appetizer , then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course ...
When going out for a nice dinner , I like a nice ambiance as well as very good food .
rice dishes and noodle dishes rarely exceed $ 5 and add on a refreshing ice drink for $ 2 and you 're set for the night !
There is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me .
After the main course came , we did n't see our waiter for at least 40 MINUTES !
Very good wine choices .
their dinner specials are fantastic .
Great find in the West Village !
the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded :) :) : )
The service was bad , the food took to forever to come , we sat on the upper level .
The food is all shared so we get to order together and eat together .
Good atmosphere , combination of all the hottest music dress code is relatively strict except on Fridays .
One thing I liked about this place is that I never felt rushed or pressured to give up my table ot incoming guests .
On a recent Saturday night , I was with a group of 5 at the Bread Bar .
the restaurant was completely empty , but she gave me a dirty look and asked , no reservations ?
The portions of the food that came out were mediocre .
We paid a fixed pricce but got nothing !!
THe back garden sitting area is very pleasant , where you can see their personal herb garden .
In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food , this is one of the best spots .
The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive .
Best Indian food I have ever eaten .
We never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating .
The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes .
All I can say is WOW !
The only thing I could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my table .
They 're also friendlier here , especially the owner , Kenny .
Very , very nice
I take all my NYC guests to VT 's .
The jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes .
Sure enough , exactly 30 minutes later we got the call and were seated promptly .
The staff members are extremely friendly and even replaced my drink once when I dropped it outside .
Try the cheesecake !
Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place .
Our waiter and all of the people helping him were attentive and genuine .
I have to agree with the previous reviewer .
My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge !
I do n't get it either .
Waitstaff are very friendly .
All my co-workers were amazed at how small the dish was .
Most importantly , food is excellent .
We were less than impressed .
Suan is a great place that I often take my friends ( classmates ) too .
Chow fun was dry ; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family .
No desert menu , no apology , nothing !!!!!!
I asked for a simple medium rare steak .
The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees .
What you are paying for is the environment and the name .
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian .
The appetizers are ok , but the service is slow .
Over the years the host , Vittorio , and his crew , have always treated me as family -- although with all the business this not-so-little gem does , it amazing he 's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor .
It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine .
Anyway , this is the last time I cross the williamsburg .
Here 's to the fake fish tanks too ...
I 'll be back for sure .
I 've eaten at all three locations and I always love , love the food , the service is always wonderful and the prices are really reasonable .
Also very inexpensive .
Even after a few bad evenings at Bardolino , I keep coming back .
This is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates .
The best burger I have had in the Village .
I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price ( just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $ 25 ) , which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place does n't have an upscale feel .
It 's a shame that a nice , convenient place like the Pink Pony can be so ruined by lousy service .
Get the tuna of gari .
The staff is accomodating , the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed , and the food is out of this world !
The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day .
There are other people waiting !
Pricey , but worth a try , at least once .
However it is the ONLY Taiwanese restaurant in town .
The prices can not be beat for the quality , quantity , freshness and taste .
Now it 's so crowded and loud you ca n't even talk to the person next to you .
believe us , we 've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs .
The location is perfect .
So some of the reviews here are accurate about the crowd and noise .
Great Indian food and the service is incredible .
Appetizers are somewhere around $ 7 each and the main dishes are between $ 11 and $ 16 .
We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and will be going back for the desserts ....
Try everything for that matter , it is all good .
We went to eat at the Jekyll and Hyde restaurant on Friday night and really enjoyed the fun atmosphere and good food .
WORST PLACE ON SMITH STREET IN BROOKLYN
So I 've never actually been to M proper , but I 've had it delivered a few times .
The staff there is very attentive and down to earth .
I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong , it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent !!
stick with the chicken , beef , and lamb dishes .
Really though , where 's the seasoning ?
we spent 50 $ $ definetly will come back with my friends !!!
Great food , amazing service , this place is a class act .
The table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long overdue bottle of wine finally arrived .
The crust is thin , the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly .
Food is great and inexpensive .
My party had the BBE $ 29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake !
The service is ok , some of the people did n't get what they asked for .
The mussaman curry that I ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that I ordered in it , they graciously provided me with ONE piece of poorly cooked potato .
Have to tell you : Not at all impressed .
Now we moved out of the state and every visit to NYC includes a stop here .
There is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times .
The atmosphere is relaxed and casual .
I heartily recommend .
I 've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious .
The service is awful .
Meanwhile , the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil , gratis .
The meat is fresh , the sauces are great , you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too .
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices .
Once for dinner and once for brunch .
I would highly recommend it .
After we got our sashimi order , I could not believe how small the portions were !
This is a true gem of the village .
And I would have to agree with the masses in terms of service - delivery is their Achilles ' heel .
The service varys from day to day - sometimes they 're very nice , and sometimes not .
The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal .
Each time we 've been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return .
It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy , creamy , and slightly buttery .
Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer .
I will be going back and heartily recommend it !
My husband and I both ordered the Steak , medium .
This place is great .
I think I 've had some the best meals of my life at minnow .
The only downside ... they only take cash which is OK if you know about it ahead of time .
We 've never had any problems with the staff but maybe we 've been lucky ?
Our first course was Tuna Sashimi with Green Yuzu Sauce .
We liked it so much , that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York .
they were able to squeeze me in at 6 after i called the night before my anniversary for a friday night reservation and told me they 'd treat us well for the occasion .
You will find yourself returning quite often .
What ?
Others have to go to other restaurants and feel sad until they 're eaten .
And forget what you read under me , the atmosphere is n't that bad either .
Overall , worht every penny .
I recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal !
The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese ( gets a little messy ) .
My boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque .
I have n't been to the other locations .
All I can say is $ 2 pints during happy hour and the some of the cheapest oysters you 'll find in the city , though the quality is some of the best .
I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date .
We recently decided to try this location , and to our delight , they have outdoor seating , perfect since I had my yorkie with me .
There was a great deal for 6 Blue Point oysters and a beer or glass of wine for $ 8 !
We ordered the special , grilled branzino , that was so infused with bone , it was difficult to eat .
The view is spectacular , and the food is great .
The wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for Chinatown ) alternative .
Definitely Highly NOT recommended .
The food is so good and so popular that waiting can really be a nightmare .
Yes , they 're a bit more expensive then typical , but then again , so is their food .
It gets very crowded so I would suggest that you get their early .
Tends to turn people away .
Was her Monday for lunch - was working on a film in the area - and found this rare jewel .
I 've been coming here as a child and always come back for the taste .
I would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard .
Our server checked on us maybe twice during the entire meal .
Deff recimmend Bukhara they also have opened two new locations guess ill try them out .
Meat dishes now adorn the selections , although there 's still a large number of vegetarian-friendly choices .
Prices are in line .
I 've been coming here on and off for the past five years and I have to say that La Lanterna has never , ever dissapointed me .
Hey , I think $ 2 + for a 5 block walk ai n't bad .
We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday , and I was thoroughly impressed with the food .
The sushi was awful !
The food was definitely good , but when all was said and done , I just could n't justify it for the price ( including 2 drinks , $ 100/person ) ...
The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger , to steak , to escargot .
The sauce on the pizza is sooo good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they do n't skimp .
The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I 've had at this price range .
Great for large groups and celebrations - our SUPER HAPPY waiter was the entertainment of the evening .
The decor is nice , but more casual than fine dining .
This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent .
THE MOST FUN RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TOO !
The food is o.k. , but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant .
Starters : Kobe Beef Sashimi .
I had the Thai style Fried Sea Bass ... which was very good .
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us .
This is a great Thai restaurant with a very friendly staff .
great toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost !
The quantity is also very good , you will come out satisfied .
The halibut cheek appetizer came with a generous portion of foie gras , but that 's about the only positive thing I can say about the meal .
There is actually space to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner .
I found it on a cold night , the perfect spot to warm up .
I ordered tamarind duck and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef , and we were both delighted by the way the dishes evoked Thai flavors in unexpected ways .
The place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious .
Best In ALL of NYC
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!
On a recent Sunday afternoon , a friend and I accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT .
Looking around , I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen .
They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another .
A hearty two thumbs up !
Love their drink menu .
To celebrate a birthday , three of us went to Mare anticipating great food .
To my right , the hostess stood over a busboy and hissed rapido , rapido as he tried to clear and re-set a table for six .
I was n't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes , but I guess that 's the price you pay for a popular place .
Went there for an office lunch .
This was , from start to finish , a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience .
I love the fact that the pizza tastes so good and is so cheap .
This place has been around for a few years .
Be sure not to get anything other than bagels ! . .
My husband and I moved to Nolita 6 years ago and for as long as we have lived here , Peasant has been our favorite !
Was surprisingly disappointed .
I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side .
Too bad the food was n't of the same heritage .
Great spot , whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner .
The wine list is interesting and has many good values .
Interior was so so .
The restaurant has a Family feel , not least with regard to the portions which are enormous ; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine .
I went this past Saturday and had a excellent meal of consisting of a braised lamb shank with mashed potatoes .
The Waitstaff were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal .
keep up the good work .
The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance .
La Rosa waltzes in , and I think they are doing it the best .
I have been twice to this restaurant .
I can not recommend OG more highly if I tried - check it out for yourself .
The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty .
We spent $ 200 in this place and left hungry and very disappointed .
Did n't seem like any effort was made to the display and quality of the food .
But that is highly forgivable .
For $ 600 ( the most we have ever paid ) not even waving a magic wand will ever get us back for a repeat performance .
My first time there I happened not to like the Crab Croquette apt that i ordered and they were happy to change it for me without making no big deal .
The staff is 100 % Italian and the food is as authentic as it gets .
For appetizers , I recommend the shrimp fritters and dumplings .
Everything about this restaurant was special .
I have been coming to this neighborhood spot for years .
The appetizers are also delicious !
you can actually get 2 salads worth if u take it home and add it to some lettuce !
I highly recommend it .
Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff .
im not necessarily fanatical about this place , but it was a fun time for low pirces .
Two people in our party felt like something else , and Volare immediately obliged with two great dishes that were not in their regular menu .
The place was quiet and delightful .
I generally like this place .
People dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans .
Nicky the Nose at the bar is a treat .
Montparnasse 's desserts -- especially the silken creme brulee and paper-thin apple tart -- are good enough on their own to make the restaurant worth the trip .
It 's really a takeaway place , I would n't sit if I could take it home .
they did n't disappoint , service from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table .
We were then shooed inside .
Three courses - choices include excellent mussels , puff pastry goat cheese and salad with a delicious dressing , and a hanger steak au poivre that is out of this world .
The pasta was well cooked , did n't have enough sauce though or flavor .
but overall i give it a 10
I wo n't go back unless someone else is footing the bill .
Ive been here so many times the waiters know my name .
Decent wine selection too .
The restaurant could use a little paint , but all in all a great sushi place !
You can even get packages of the chutneys to stock your fridge !
Their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for .
Sushi so fresh that it crunches in your mouth .
The closest that I got was the Cherry Marscapone , but they were out of it that day .
Would n't recomend it for dinner !
I have to say I have never had a disapointing meal here .
Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away .
bottles of wine are cheap and good .
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for a first date .
I absolutely love this place !!!
Great friendly service , Fast seating , Fast Delivery , Excellent sushi .
What more could you want ?
I would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices .
This place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city .
I also ordered the Change Mojito , which was out of this world .
This place is the most Japanese it can ever get .
Maybe the secret was that we went on a Sunday night and everything was great .
This is my favorite Italian restaurant in all of New York City .
we were seated at the sushi bar in front of yasuda .
From the terrible service , to the bland food , not to mention the unaccommodating managers , the overall experience was horrible .
I could have drank 4 glasses of water and still been parched - so watch out .
The service is outstanding and my crab-cake eggs benedict could not have been better .
But they do .
There was a long wait for a table outside , but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice .
Considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time , the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed .
The service was extremely fast and attentive ( thanks to the service button on your table ) but I barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order .
Service was very friendly .
How is this palce still open ?
The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water .
This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls .
The food , drinks and service are clearly among the best in the city .
The bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the " free " appetizer of olives was disappointing .
It was huge , delicious , fresh , and will be the reason we return .
This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent .
Have always found that the waiters will go out of their way to be helpful , despite the fact they are often busy with lots of diners .
I would recommend Roxy 's for that , but not for their food .
Great Indian food and the service is incredible .
The food here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it .
Loved it
But they do n't have a toaster , which is strange .
Murray wo n't do it .
The dim sum here is only so-so .
I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken .
I can not imagine you not rushing out to eat there .
We were n't even at our table for more than an hour total .
Skip this restaurant , it 's a big disappointment .
We , there were four of us , arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude .
Service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique-seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience .
it 's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food .
Maybe it was the great company ( I had friends visiting from Philly – yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but I just ca n’t say enough good things about this brasserie .
Culinaria is a welcome addition to the Garment district - far better than any restaurant in the area .
For some reason , all the seafood on the menu was unavailable except for the Salmon .
Okay-i do n't mind the oily part ( cause most are cooked that way ) but it was way too bland .
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose .
Coffee is a better deal than overpriced Cosi sandwiches .
the salads are delicious , both refreshing and very spicy .
Best Italian food I ever had ( and being Italian , that means alot ) .
You can not go wrong with this place .
Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
Good Experience
The hostess said " Wow that 's a large group , unless you are n't together " , to which I replied " no we are , and there will be one more , so a table for six please . "
Service is friendly , prices are good - delivery time was a little slow , but for the way this pizza tastes , I 'm willing to overlook it .
Whether it 's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar , you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite .
It can be a very fun experience with a group , and kids ( 6 and over ) would love it .
I LOVE their Thai noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST !
Was there Friday night .
We visited Orsay during NY Restaurant Week and tried their $ 35 menu .
If you are a Tequila fan you will not be disappointed .
Easily the worst stir-fried squid I 've ever tasted .
Romantic if you want it to be ( brightly lit ) .
He was terribly thirsty after the meal too .
Went to Village last night for my birthday .
They have a delicious banana chocolate dessert , as well as a great green tea tempura .
Skip this restaurant , it 's a big disappointment .
i would recommend reservations on weekends though .
And these are not small , wimpy fast food type burgers - these are real , full sized patties .
The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic , just simple , small and sparse .
I have been to Casimir over 5 times and I have always had a great time there .
It 's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone .
After the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner .
the mushroom barley soup is amazing .
The waitstaff were attentive , polite and helpful - an impressive feat in such close quarters .
We started with lox and mussels ( the best ive ever had , ever ) and had the cod and trout for dinner .
Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store .
If the weather is nice , try to snag an outside table .
The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual .
they really provide a relaxing , laid-back atmosphere .
The people in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud .
If you wrote a bad review , it 's because you do n't understand what Rao 's is all about .
Never once did I leave feeling unwelcome or impressed .
Based on a visit a month ago , I returned the week before Christmas and was hugely disappointed .
This food is asian-air fusion .
I love this place more and more everytime i go .
They are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in Yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey .
SO GOOD
The flavors are very fresh and pretty inobtrusive , nothing flashy .
I have to say I have never had a disapointing meal here .
I live in the neightborhood and am a regular .
I care more about the food and ambience .
Baluchi 's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices .
It can not be the ambience , because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle .
Eating at Ottimo is like eating in Chef Salvatore Esposito 's home .
A gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order .
For great chinese food nearby , you have Wu Liang Ye and Grand Sichuan just a block away .
Have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience .
we did notice however , that some tables had what looked like pita instead of naan .
lobster was good , nothing spectacular .
We recently decided to try this location , and to our delight , they have outdoor seating , perfect since I had my yorkie with me .
Malted Milk Ball Gelato - have you ever in your life heard of anything so ridiculously wonderful ?
The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed .
I am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded .
I will be returning .
First of all Dal Bukhara Rocks .
They also do a great job for restaurant week .
The buffet had a nice selection .
The restaraurant is very small so reservations are a must .
With so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district , is truly an excellent find !
The absolute worst service I 've ever experienced and the food was below average ( when they actually gave people the meals they ordered ) .
The food is reliable and the price is moderate .
Went on a 3 day oyster binge , with Fish bringing up the closing , and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended , because it was so great !
This is a nice sushi restaurant in Brooklyn that 's located on 86 street , right underneath the train station .
I found the food , service and value exceptional everytime I have been there .
Ask for Usha , the nicest bartender in manhattan .
All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends !
Pacifico is a great place to casually hang out .
Definately check it out !!!
Slightly above average wines start at $ 70 + with only one selection listed at $ 30 + .
But , hey , there is anything better with a decent vegetarian selection in Astoria .
This place has totally weird decor , stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional ...
Thank You Emilio .
And you 're hungry a few hours later .
Atmosphere is nice and relaxed too ...
Very good service and very good prices .
But too far east !
The worst excuse for Japanese food I 've ever encountered .
Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner .
For the price , you can not eat this well in Manhattan .
But the service is HORRID !
It 's just O.K. pizza .
The food is good , especially their more basic dishes , and the drinks are delicious .
It was raining , and we figured why not ?
Plus , on Wednesday nights the house wine is unlimited !
We were on our way back to NJ , and since I am in NY , we figured why not grab some food ?
The cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee !!
I have never had cheescake like this .
The food is average : breakfast food , soups , salads , sandwiches , etc .
Do n't eat here unless you 're starving for thai food and you work next door .
Every waitress and customer who passed by me bumped into my chair .
I thought this place was totally overrated .
The atmosphere was crowded but it was a great bistro-type vibe .
I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service .
A different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) .
Our waitress was sweet and accomodating , not overbearing .
So , if yo really do n't care who is sittingnext to you , which is about 2 inches away , I would say try it .
Owner must have coem on this website to give himself credit .
We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh .
Everything is delicious , though , my gf and I come here once a week sometimes - you will get addicted !
would NOT go back .
we have been there 3 times since last week we alked it by chance first day the manager offerd us the margherita pizza adn we said yes .
Frites were delicious if a bit on the thick side .
The room is a gorgeous , bi-level space and the long bar perfect for a drink .
This is the perfect spot for meeting friends , having lunch , dinner , pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks !
The dinner was ok , nothing I would have again .
Authentic Korean food lovers should visit 32nd Street , of course .
The food is great .
Most importantly , it is reasonably priced .
Cornelia Street looks like a Broadway set for West Side Story and the inside of Po is so cool quaint you really ca n't top the setting for a romantic dinner in NYC .
I wish they had one near my office - I would go everyday .
The food here does a great service to the name ( Cantonese that is ... ) .
noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST !
The ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal , but some dishes are quite good , such as the eggplant parmesan , veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca .
I 'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food .
They 're are better Taiwanese restaurants and they are located in Flushing , Queens .
Stumbled upon this gem of a pizza place and I will be going back frequently .
bad staff
great taste
I had the best ravioli ever .
This is the best thing in Soho .
Mussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening .
Baluchi 's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices .
I recommend it !
I was n't there for the Half-Price Saturday Night Special , but Tuesday Night .
fresh restaurant was amazing ....... . food was delicious and of course fresh .
Food is excellent quality for a good restaurant price .
If you want to dine with large party , I recommend to make reservation BASEMENT .
The place is a BISTRO which means : simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere .
They are by far the BEST past in New York .
The last time I went we were seated at a table in a corridor next to the kitchen .
Noodle pudding is exactly the type of service and food I enjoy .
Service is not exactly five star , but thats not really a big deal .
I always get the Shabu-Shabu dinner and the beef is always fresh .
We waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right .
Favourites include : potato spinach gnocchi and the lamb .
Good food at the restaurant ( a bit expensive , but great if you want to impress your date ) .
Yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously , but it should n't .
Yes , they use fancy ingredients , but even fancy ingredients do n't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .
the homemade Guacamole , the unbelievable entree , and thee most amazing deserts .
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta ( raddichio was kind of bitter though ) .
The food was wonderful and imaginative .
I 'm looking forward to going back soon and eventually trying most everything on the menu !
Each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface , and you get platters of thin sliced meats , various vegetables , and rice and glass noodles .
This place has the best pizza .
Oh , do n't even let me start with how expensive the bills were !
Recommendations , of course , are required !
Try everything for that matter , it is all good .
But I 'd go back
I 've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times , but more often I order delivery .
Most of the servers are very attentive , friendly and quite attractive .
Great neighborhood joint .
His response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening .
The bruscetta is a bit soggy , but the salads were fresh , included a nice mix of greens ( not iceberg ) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen .
Go there on an empty stomach and leave feeling like a baby Veal Calf ( ok bad joke ) , but you will see .
The food was good .
The location and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it .
Dessert - ca n't be missed , so save room !!!
I ca n't wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic patio .
food was luke warm .
You 'll adore it .
Keep up the good work guys !
Ummm ... the beer was cold .
Visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews .
Also they were $ 15 each !
My friend is 100 % right in the experience we had .
It 's a small cute restaurant .
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines .
Read all the other review , they 'll confirm it .
Meat-phobes are in luck with the extraordinary veggie burger , made from a distinctive blend of chickpeas , carrots and other vegetables and spices .
Love the Jazz bands on Fri and Sat .
The fried calamari was even better !
The service is awful -- the last time I was there ( and I do mean the last time ) we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave .
The wait staff was loud and inconsiderate .
The bartender on my most recent visit was so incredibly rude that I will never go back .
This establishment is the real deal .
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place .
Great atmoshere and worth every bit .
I 've been here twice now .
Great food at REASONABLE prices , makes for an evening that ca n't be beat !
I have never had anything like it !
And they provided a delicious dessert on the house !
The food was great .
I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors .
Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens , this is among the best .
The only positive was the wait staff , which was prompt , knowledgable , and likeable .
There is a real gallery of stars that have visited .
Will not be back .
This place was the worst .
The prices are not terrible .
After really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner .
I LOOOVE their eggplant pizza , as well as their pastas !
I read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself , but may be it is worth it .
Their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic .
People are always friendly .
Everyone was more then happy with his choices .
they were dry and disgusting , i did n't even finish my first piece .
Best dish is nori-wrapped tuna .
I love and I know gourmet food by excellence !
The waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing .
The pizza is good though .
I will not be coming here at 3am again .
Will comeback for sure , wish they have it here in LA . .
Great wine list , reasonably priced . -- Sara
The corned beef was tender and melted in my mouth .
Try sushimi cucumber roll .
Now at the top of our list , Del Frisco 's Steakhouse .
Definitely something to come down and check out .
We did tip , I guess the model/waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager .
For the people who want great food plus great service , Roxy is a place to AVOID !
Always good drinks and service is pretty good ;
They even scoop it out nice ( for those on a diet ) not too much not to little .
We 've lived in the area for more than 8 years .
Worth the trip from Manhattan .
This restaurant used to be our regular Thursday night dinner location .
You want to have a real hot dog in Brooklyn ?
Check it out .
Seating is ok even though sometimes there 's alot of people .
First , the waiter who served us neglected to fill us in on the specials , which I would have chosen had I known about them .
The flavors robust and subtle .
Quite frankly , this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried .
It 's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend .
The food tasted very good .
WE WERE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WITH OUR CHOICE .
Food does n't appear to be cooked on premisis but there 's a high turnover so its pretty fresh .
Have frequented ' ino for several years and the food remains excellent .
Yes , there might be a wait if you have no reservations .
The music which is sometimes a little too heavy for my taste .
The restaurant was packed at first , so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated .
Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant .
Arigato Gozimas Yuka !
If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you 'll love it here .
My husband and I enjoy Sangria .
The jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes .
Service is average .
Such a disappointment ...
It 's very spicy but not offensive .
I only tried a simple dish of spinach ravioli in a light oil and garlic sauce , but it actually faired better than most NYC Italian joints I 've tried similar dishes at .
I need at least three rolls to be full , and that 's at least $ 14.00 !
Bay Terrace mall is nothing ( ok , almost nothing ) without it !
Taxan delicious !
I was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter .
Harumi Sushi has the freshest and most delicious array of sushi in NYC .
The pizza is the best if you like thin crusted pizza .
However , in the summer of 2003 , it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup .
Great service , great food .
I went there with my friend last saturday .
You rarely have to wait for a seat and the currys ( masaman , green , red ) are full of flavor and come super spicy if you ask for it .
Good service , great food , good value , and never have to wait in line !
Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else .
Try the chocolate mud cake ( warmed ) with 2 scoops of dulce de leche gelato .
However , looking at the table next to ours , we both sort of wished we had ordered pizza , which looked PERRRRRRRRRFECT .
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date .
The fettucino alfredo was amazing .
It was rather pathetic that it took them over an hour to seat us .
The food is yummy , especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries .
I was looking for banana tempura for dessert and they dont have .
No , really .
Their calzones are horrific , bad , vomit-inducing , YUCK .
It was a very nice surprise .
Each bite of food at Kai was indeed delicious , fresh , and elegant .
I recommend the black roasted codfish , it was the best dish of the evening .
Not only is the food authentic , but the staff here are practically off-the-boat , they are young and hip and know what they are doing when it comes to food and wine .
Not enough wines by the glass either .
I have eaten at Shabu Tatsu at least 5 times and I always want to go back for more !
Service , however , was excellent ... and I liked the setting/atmosphere a lot .
i 've noticed megadeth , mr. scruff , st. germain , traditional vietnamese songs , black sabbath , jay-z , and daft punk all being played .
Go girls !!!
Overall I was impressed and will return , it 's a great QPR ( Quality to Price Ratio ) .
The service was attentive and her suggestions of menu items was right on the mark .
The food is very good , but not outstanding .
We started with the scallops and asparagus and also had the soft shell crab as well as the cheese plate .
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE HEARTLAND BREWERY .
The food was amazing , the service was so attentive and personable , and how about that ambience !
I 've enjoyed 99 % of the dishes we 've ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional too-authentic-for-me dish ( I 'm a daring eater but not THAT daring ) .
No apologies during restaurant week .
The appetizing is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable price ( if bought by the pound ) .
Service was also very good .
Do n't get me started on the margaritas , either .
but the service was a bit slow .
Although the place could be a little more eye catching and roomier , at the same time , it does n't really matter .
Thius is a must for anyone who loves Shabu-Shabu .
I have been to Mary 's many times and I like it .
The large selection of bruschettas , paninis , tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating .
Much more reasonably priced too !
Entrees include classics like lasagna , fettuccine Alfredo and chicken parmigiana .
Again , if you are in this neighborhood - by all means , come here .
Among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants , this offers by far one of the best values for your money .
The menu is great , with a good selection , and everything that I have tried is absolutely delicious .
Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef .
But now that it 's under new ownership and has been renovated , it looks great .
But , they were too big for the bun .
All of it was simply amazing , unique and tasty and best of all it did n't break the bank .
Ca n't wait wait for my next visit .
I 've made the trip out here a few times with a friend who lives nearby ( I live on UWS ) .
Never have I had such dramatic delivery guys ( a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c I live in a walkup ) who always seem disappointed with their tips .
The only drawback is that it 's a little pricey .
In the evening , this place attracted a well dressed , with it , NY crowd .
The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach .
I have tried the various slice joints around the village but this is by far the best one .
It is the best hidden spot there and I rave about it to everyone .
If you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde .
My friends settled for rice dishes , but we came back the following day to try the dim sum , which was good ... not outstanding , but good .
Good food : my favorite is the seafood spaghetti .
When my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .
My roommate and I LOVE this place .
This is n't your corner Chinese food takeout .
My boyfriend and I recently had an early dinner at Artisanal and was satisfied with our experience .
All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better !
It is thick and slightly soggy .
I had my eyes on this place , promising myself I will one day ' give it a try . '
Since it literally is a complete hole in the wall , it 's a bit intimidating at first , but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you - do n't hesitate to ask for help with what to get .
The dim sum servings here are a bit larger than I 'm used to .
Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting .
Excellent food , although the interior could use some help .
The service was dreadfully slow ( the place was only half full ) and a smile would have been nice ...
Try the Pad Thai , it 's fabulous and their prices are so cheap !
We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche .
If you do n't mind pre-sliced low quality fish , unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place .
From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff , I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it .
While it 's not Nobu , it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full .
Just do n't take the seat between the bar and the back half of the restaurant , i saw a woman get nudged 40times sitting there .
but for the value , it was a great affordable spot to enjoy a fun night out with small group .
I loved this place !!
This was one of the BEST restaurants I 've ever been to .
Dakshin is one of the few affordable and tasty Indian restaurant in the upper east side .
Boy was I wrong !
With the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room .
We always have a delicious meal and always leave feeling satisfied .
Good spreads , great beverage selections and bagels really tasty .
The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I 've had at this price range .
In any event , even though its a bit on the pricey side , we still love this restaurant and will definitely go back .
Stepping into Casa La Femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in New York !
Great bagels made the old-fashioned way .
my picks are : - Scallion Pancake ( fried with vegetable juice , very special and tasty ) - Guizhou Chicken - Shredded Squid Family Style ( one of my personal favorites ) - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab - Shuizhu Fish ( this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans , I would n't recommend to my American friends as it 's very spicy .
You can eat gourmet food at a fast food price .
But trust me it is so worth it .
We 've been following chef Lyle 's food around New York for 15 years and while remaining classic , his innovations with bistro fare have made us return and return .
Indo Chinese food , pretty good ...
We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night .
LOVE the atmosphere - felt like I was in Paris .
Just an odd group .
While the $ 20 entree range is not overly expensive , in New York City , there is definitely better food in that range , and so Sapphire , despite it 's lovely atmosphere , will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return .
Took my mom for Mother 's Day , and the maitre d' was pretty rude .
What I did n't like was how the food came right after it was ordered .
We 've always gotten amazing service and we love the food .
I complained to the waiter and then to the manager , but the intensity of rudeness from them just went up .
Lives up to the hype
We had Pam 's special fried fish and it was amazing .
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere .
Dessert was also to die for !
We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order .
When I 'm feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office , I head for Cafe St. Bart 's .
Casablanca servces delicious falafel , tabouleh , humus and other Mediterranean delights , which are all very inexpensive .
Small servings for main entree , i had salmon ( wasnt impressed ) girlfriend had chicken , it was good .
There are many french bistros in the midtown area , and I wholheartedly recommend this one .
Everything was wonderful ; food , drinks , staff , mileau .
Yakitori ( bbq meats ) is tasty too .
( $ 200 for 2 glasses of champagne , not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks ) .
I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night .
Horrible food and Horrible service .
The pizza was great .
We arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly .
Great food at reasonable prices .
Pizza here is consistently good .
Perhaps this food is considered extreme to an Upper East Side resident , but for the rest of us who 've actually eaten ethnic food , this is simply dull .
It 's a steal !
hmmm .
Not because you are " The Four Seasons " ... – you are allowed to charge an arm and a leg for a romatic dinner .
the food is always fresh ...
First went here to enjoy their garden terrace .
You will find everything about Trio to your liking !
Order the panang duck , it 's fantastic .
You have to increase the service a lot .
The floor was wet , the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor , no soap , and no hand towels left .
Toons has recently been redone , so it 's now a very attractive space .
SEA has become so popular that they 've let it go to their heads .
This is the best Italian restaurant in the city .
It was pleasantly uncrowded , the service was delightful , the garden adorable , the food ( from appetizers to entrees ) was delectable .
I went to Del Frisco 's Friday night with my boyfriend for an 8:00 reservation .
Keep up the good work guys !
If the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items BBQ-ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not-so-fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .
We ended the dinner with a surprisingly light and flaky apple tarte tatin .
Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else .
If celebrities make you sweat , then your in for a ride , but if your like most around these parts then you 'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype .
Our food was great too !
The service is pretty good .
The crackling calamari salad , which is usually a cheap disaster at many restaurants , is crispy and lightly dressed .
we love th pink pony .
And their prices are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and service !
All the food was hot tasty .
Yeah , sometimes the service can be slow .
this is the best secret place in midtown ' , I heard that from the bartender , after having brilliant food ( try steak with portobello mushrooms ) and drinks on the bar last Tuesday .
But they do .
There was a small wait , but shorter than I expected .
The Thai food is good .
still stay away , the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were serves eventhough they were there much longer ...
I completely recommend Casa La Femme for any special occasion and to REALLY impress your date .
i 'm surprised about some of the bad reviews posted here - i 've been to tamarind about 5 or 6 times and always come away extremely satisfied and looking forward to returning .
Interesting selection , good wines , service fine , fun decor .
I 've waited over one hour for food .
Satisfying .
This place is to be avoided .
I plan on eating here more often .
The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great .
The barebecued salmon is elegantly spiced and not at all dry .
Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top .
And the food was fantastic .
We were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the service was very quick and professional .
This place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area .
The food was as creative as the decor and both worked .
This restaurant was way overhyped .
The only thing more wonderful than the food ( which is exceptional ) is the service .
I know because I live nearby .
I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she " had a BBQ to go to " that night - WTF ??
What an amazing meal and experience !
These innovators of french indian fusion do a great job of making dishes as interesting as possible while still being accessible .
Unfortunately , with our show tickets , we did n't have time to sample any desserts .
Maybe I say so because it looked promising for people who like artery-clogging jewish deli food , but turns out to be poorly run and awful .
I 've waited over one hour for food .
I do n't get it either .
I stumbled upon this great pizzeria as I explored my new neighborhood .
We were n't even at our table for more than an hour total .
As we waited I watched 3 seperate groups of diners discuss how dissapointed they also were .
The bagels are also reasonably priced for NYC .
When he 's not making authentic Neapolitan pizza in the open brick oven or lightly frying zucchini blossoms , he 's visiting the regulars ( a growing legion ) and checking on newcomers .
It 's a great find in Astoria .
Not sure where the previous reviewer , lonk , dined , but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food !
Our visit their to say the least , was an unpleasant and costly experience !
those rolls were big , but not good and sashimi was n't fresh .
That place was awesome , , , sally !
While the menu is n't especially groundbreaking , everything I 've tried so far has been well-executed and tasty .
Trust me , it will be great , and all of it will be devoured in no time .
My boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent .
Overall , the best bagel in town .
Wondering who had the best deals we noticed a line had formed to wait for this one particular establishment .
My wife and I will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them , as they tend to offer large portions .
This is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed .
big and soft as well as good lunch food .
Butter was melted , white wine warm , cheese oozing everywhere .
However , it 's not worth a special trip .
Leon is an East Village gem : casual but hip , with well prepared basic French bistro fare , good specials , a warm and lively atmosphere .
Very different than regular dimsum places .
Yes , it is good , but I 've had better for cheaper .
From the erbazzone emiliana to the mostarda on the cheese plate , the dishes at this restaurant are all handled with delicate care .
Taking Hot Dogs to the next level
Great atmoshere and worth every bit .
The corned beef and pastrami are excellent , much less fatty than those big tourist places around Times Square .
The all-Italian staff is warm and engaging from the start .
Red Dragon Roll - my favorite thing to eat , of any food group - hands down
My family and I ate here last night for our annual Christmas dinner with the family members who would rather spend the holidays with friends out-of-town .
And amazingly cheap .
The owner truly caters to all your needs .
The food is consistant and good but how it got name Best Diner In Manhattan is beyond me .
The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day .
We shared a bottle of sake , an order of edamames , and she had the sushi plate while I had the sashimi .
If you 're craving for Haru 's great food , especially the House Roll , but ca n't stand the wait building outisde , head across the street to their Sake Bar !
Their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for .
Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment .
My entire family was horrified .
Where Gabriela personaly greets you and recommends you what to eat .
Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town !
May , the owner always has a smile on her and will warmly greet you .
The food is nothing like its menu description .
For all you lazy folks that do n't want to come to Alphabet City , I say , good - stay out .
Although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great .
Truly the mark of an attentive waiter .
I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki and my husband got Garlic Shrimp .
The service was poor , restaurant poorly lit , staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald 's than this joint .
I HATE HATE HATE this place .
A coworker and I tried Pacifico after work a few Fridays and loved it .
Come on .
We were very pleasantly surprised .
The mussles were the fishiest things I 've ever tasted , the seabass was bland , the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese , the penne w / chicken had bones in it ... It was disgusting .
This Thai restaurant is a couple blocks away from Sripraphai ( another delicious Thai restaurant ) .
The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates .
While the ambiance and atmosphere were great , the food and service could have been a lot better .
I could n't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach .
It is so romantic .
While the food was excellent , it was n't cheap ( though not extremely expensive either ) .
The red sliding doors may be unique but they do not block off the cold air from the outside .
It ’s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘ excuse me ’ before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth !
The hostess was very pleasant .
Compared to other shabu restaurants around town , this places wins hands-down .
The pastas are incredible , the risottos ( particularly the sepia ) are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing .
The catch is that you are charged extra for ANYTHING that you leave on your plate so do n't be a greedy pig !
Even better , they know how to cook French classics like Steak au Poivre and Onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it .
The sauces used are also not that exciting .
Overpriced and not tasty
Everyone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi , seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice !
But WARNING : to all those that use this site be weary , be very weary of recommendations .
Get the tuna of gari .
This restaurant is VEGETARIAN ; there are NO MEAT dishes whatsoever .
This is literally a hot spot when it comes to the food .
Everything looks great , the drinks , the decor , the food , even the people .
Fantastic !
The combination of fresh tomato sauce , fresh mozz cheese , basil and the dough they make with imported flour , makes this is one of the better pizza 's in NY .
I 'm almost tempted to give this place a bad review so I can keep the crowds away ... been going there on and off for a year now and it 's really my fave hang out in the city .
Based on the reviews for dinner , this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that , but definitely not for Dim Sum again .
The servers give you some sample slices of your order while you wait ( shortly I might add ) .
Any if you have a reservation you 'll wait for max 5 minutes - so have a drink at the bar .
We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods .
But on a lazy Saturday night , we ended up going .
The only weird thing was if we got a bottle , the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price X4 , which makes no sense whatsoever .
just walk by the window and see all the unbiased positive reviews in all the major nyc publications .
This is the first time Citysearch did ' t call it right .
There are many Thai places in the city but so far Toons is # 1 .
My only problem is that you are literally sitting on top of the people next to you !
Excellent spot for holiday get togethers with co-workers or friends that you have n't seen in a while .
The worst excuse for Japanese food I 've ever encountered .
The nakgi-bokum was horrible .
Plain and simple it 's bad thai food .
They have authentic Indian at amazin prices .
Growing up in NY , I have eaten my share of bagels .
Haru on Park S is simply disgusting .
A wonderful place !
Way below average
Not to sound too negative but be wary of the delivary .
Definitely try the calamari , any pasta , or even the Sliced steak entree .
Try green curry with vegetables .
Also , they do not take credit card so come with cash !
Be aware .
I go twice a month !
happy to be a regular at this place and would warmly recommend it to anyone .
Try their chef 's specials -- they are to die for .
Believe me , they live up to the name .
and for this i had to shell out a small fortune ?
Patsy 's Pizza = true love
Do n't waste money on decor .
Overall , decent food at a good price , with friendly people .
Spice is sleek , modern and cool with a menu that will not hurt your wallet .
They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great .
The cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables , but the service could have been better .
they live up to the thai way of living .
A defitely must visit .
But the meals were terrible .
Went here last night - nice decor , good service , but the food was surprisingly excellent .
It is not a place for tourists or someone who has never dined in Bay Ridge .
My boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent .
The menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them .
Taxan delicious !
There 's nice and quiet , small but enough for 6 ( or more ) .
The place was nice and calm .
They have homemade pastas of all kinds -- I recommend the gnocchi -- yum !
The staff is n't the friendliest or most competent , and I am stickler for service , but everything else about this place makes up for it .
No plans to return anytime soon .
Amazing !
They are the best bagels I 've had .
Food was very good , but not what I would consider out of this world .
Fantastic !
Rosario 's is without a doubt one of the greatest pizzerias in existence .
I had Filet Mignon with garlic mash .
The lobster sandwich is $ 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price .
The boutique selection of wines covers a wide variety without being imposeing .
All in all a wonderful experience , ca n't wait to come back .
Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you , but the food does n't quite match up .
At first we were a little taken aback , as this seemed to present a problem , although the restaurant looked fairly empty , but they hastily put the table together for us .
Good , because hey , it 's more food , but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap .
We were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd .
i know , you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored , but my agenda is i 'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends , seeking a pleasant experience .
The restaurant is cute but not upscale .
The lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it .
We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai .
They have great rolls , the triple color and norwegetan rolls , are awesome and filling .
This place is incredibly tiny .
So rude !!!
The sauce is excellent ( very fresh ) with dabs of real mozzarella .
( I 've ordered from the 2nd ave.
Desserts are almost incredible : my personal favorite is their Tart of the Day .
Still , any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house ...
Seriously , this place kicks ass .
My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .
Probably would not go again ...
The portions are HUGE , so it might be good to order three things to split ( rather than one appetizer and entree per person ) for two people .
Seating is always prompt , though the restaurant does fill up in the evening .
The dim sum however was very good .
Great food , great waitstaff , great atmosphere , and best of all GREAT beer !
This place , which is only a few months old , is perhaps Queens ' biggest secret !
It was good , but none of the flavors WOW .
The side dishes were passable , and I did get a refill upon request .
The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it .
Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza ( as I love La Pizza Fresca ) .
I do n't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron 's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff ( more than the price ) .
The service is excellent and always informative without an air .
The place was nice and calm .
Good spreads , great beverage selections and bagels really tasty .
I seriously doubt I will ever dine at Jimmy 's Bronx , or for that matter , Jimmy 's Uptown , again .
At first i was rolling my ideas of yet another French place on the UES .
For those prices and the dressed up atmosphere you expect more and should get more .
On our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table .
I used to be a regular costumer at pongal until dosa hut opened right next door to it .
Everyone was smiling so that made me feel welcome .
The entire place and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt .
stick with the chicken , beef , and lamb dishes .
As a Japanese native , I 've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years , but I was just so amazed at this place .
Take a good sense of humor , an American express card with no limit , walk out with a lollipop , gift bag in hand and enough marketing materials for alain to to take the show on the road
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you wo n't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME !!!!
I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee ( rice porridge ) .
The one vegetarian entree ( Abby 's treasure ) was actually quite a surprise - it was delicious and had wintermelon covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables .
We ordered a glass of wine and were finished eating and paying before the wine came .
Since we were already waiting so long , we felt we had no other choice but to accept it .
being a fan of spicy ethnic foods , indian included , i made friends with this place long ago .
Two wasted steaks -- what a crime !
The food is excellent !
I am so coming back here again , as much as I can .
Not because I was pregnant , but the food here is always delicious .
Good drink .
The menu is interesting and quite reasonably priced .
The food is also outstanding and is served quite quickly .
I had roast chicken and a salad .
Do n't expect to sit down inside though , there are only a few tables and they are always full .
I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks !
The place was n't too hard to find , but it was kind of packed , as soon as my boyfriend and I got our food , the line reached the door .
When we threatened to leave , we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing .
Siam Square is fairly new to the neighborhood and I think in time will gain the recognition it deserves .
At 5 dumplings for $ 1 , you just can not go wrong .
The menu looked great , and the waiter was very nice , but when the food came , it was average .
The homage to India is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer , a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce , while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated , fresh take on sweet-and-sour .
I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read .
I highly recommend it for not just its superb cuisine , but also for its friendly owners and staff .
The food -- though mostly deep-fried -- is simple and satisfying .
If you love wine and cheese and delicious french fare , you 'll love Artisanal !
A guaranteeed delight !
The best part of the experience was knowing that the manager ( a bubbly , friendly young woman with a great smile ) truly cared about how we were doing .
Taj Mahal offeres gret value and great food .
Turned out there was full service upstairs and sat down .
We got a little tipsy from the sake but is n't that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about ?
Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner
Had we been stalling I could understand where they were coming from , but we had been there less than an hour and they had n't even brought us a check yet !
I 'm partial to the Gnocchi .
Good crowd , good outdoor seating , with a hip japanese vibe .
I ordered the chu chu curry and my friend ordered the pad thai chicken .
I live a block away and go to Patsy 's frequently .
The ceiling is amazing !
The decor is designed in a contemporary Japanese style restaurant .
Other than the crappy service from two individuals , it 's great .
I recommend their Pad See Ew , Pork Chops or Tofu plates .
Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet , where greasy , dry and tasteless are complimentary .
Great sake !
This is the first place I 've been that a runner remembers my order ... hope he likes his job because I have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant .
Remind me of home .
But after last night , Spice Grill is the only place I 'm eating indian cuisine .
I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork .
All the staff is absolutely professional !!
We 've lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had dinner there .
Went there for a special celebration .
Acceptable prices .
Nice find .
We were charged full price .
The ambiance was fine , a little loud but still nice and romantic .
I would highly recommend this place !
The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary .
Had a late night dinner on a Saturday night .
Quartino is my favoriate resturant in NYC .
The environment is romantic , but the food is horrible , the service is pathetic , and gabriella lies about everything she could .
From the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the place was packed .
I would highly recommend this place to everyone for any occasion !
I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one .
it helps if you know what to order .
The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine ( which cost less than the food ) , and made it seem like a big concession .
I would never wait for a table to eat , it just is not THAT great .
We laughed when he finally offered us a dessert menu and we left a 10 percent tip , which was generous , I feel .
Definitely will be back !
We went to this restaurant based on prior internet comments .
Bon appettite !!
The place was real empty but that was because this was the first Sunday they ever opened .
The staff was accomodating , the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely .
It 's just average , just shredded , no seasoning on it .
We will be back .
I live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of The Pizza Place at 3am .
Owner is pleasant and entertaining .
Given the incredible architecture surrounding it , this place has no character .
OU MUST TRY THIS RESTAURANT .
Excellent dumplings served amid clean , chic decor .
We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there , sharing a large Pelligrino , a pizza of two of their specials , one was goat cheese the other blue cheese , and both were excellent .
The food is okay and the prices here are mediocre .
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service .
The tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .
The staff is also attentive and friendly .
The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough ( both in quantity AND quality ) .
quacamole at pacifico is yummy , as are the wings with chimmichuri .
The drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced .
Inside is a little cramped , but to be expected .
The chicken dinner was real good .
Have recommended the place to friends , always gets good response .
My friends and I came across this place while walking in the village .
Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
The service is ok , some of the people did n't get what they asked for .
Will give it another chance before I write it off .
Host and Hostess was quite rude .
I never had anything I did n't like here .
Even if the food was n't this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax .
The wine the service was very good too .
Our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese .
I must say the view of NYC is so beautiful !
Besides , we were on vacation !
The staff ignored my friends and I the entire time we were there .
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .
It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy , creamy , and slightly buttery .
It is nearly impossible to get a table , so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner , DO NOT pass it up .
less wait time for me !
I love to visit Murrays for my bagel fix .
honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives .
Have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience .
It 's the kind of place I like to support !
I went to Amma after a friend recommended it .
The steak melted in my mouth .
But $ 500 for a dinner for two that did n't include Wine ?
They 're are better Taiwanese restaurants and they are located in Flushing , Queens .
The price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate .
I ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime .
I paid just about $ 60 for a good meal , though : )
It 's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we 've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years .
I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time .
I have no idea why this restaurant is so often overlooked .
The wait staff is friendly , and the food has gotten better and better !
I take all my NYC guests to VT 's .
I keep my fingers crossed the whole subway ride hoping that there will be a table I can sit at by myself and not have to share with the rice congee soup people .
We have been to Montparnasse many times and return often for good reason .
If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible !
Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza .
i do n't usually order wine with indian so i ca n't comment on their wine list or their wines .
The other night we had the $ 30 three course meal and everything was delicious - if I could of licked the plate clean I would of .
overpriced japanese food with mediocre service
I have lived in NY for many years and have dined at many restaraunts .
Whenever you need a Sushi fix , Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service .
A cool place to hang with your friends for a couple of healthy drinks and desserts .
The tastes makes your mouth water for more .
If you 've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer .
The crowd was older and the restaurant is very cramped , but it has old school charm .
Best things to order are from the grill ( Churrasco and Ribs ) .
The rice to fish ration was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice .
No thanks !!!
It 's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend .
I have to say that if this what makes it easier to get a saet a lunch - I dont mind .
I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll .
This place must have cost the owners afortune to build .
I have been going there since it opened and I ca n't get enough .
Could have had better for 1/3 the price in Chinatown .
After I paid for my purchase , I noticed they had not given me utensils so I could eat my pie .
i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family .
It is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late , raucus dinner .
Feels like family when we go there .
She gets 10 for her excellent service and advice .
Yes , the place is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while .
Moules were excellent , lobster ravioli was VERY salty !
I like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing .
The staff is very attentive and we can almost always get a table .
I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors .
They have it all -- great price , food , and service .
Their duck here is also absolutely delicious .
Went with mommy ( the only person who could afford taking me here ) .
I read the other review and have to say I had the opposite experience here last Sunday .
Nice ambiance , nice little bar , good bartender , Francois , and good service .
With all the mundane or mediocre places on 8th avenue it is nice to have one that is a step above in quaility and atmosphere .
ALWAYS full with tourists ( especially because of it 's close proximity to Rockefeller Center ) .
great food , great wine list , great service in a great neighborhood ...
Also , specify if you like your food spicy - its rather bland if you do n't .
And really large portions .
The service was excellent and the food was delicious .
I plan to come here again and look forward to trying their assortment of bruschetta , panini 's .....
This place is not worth the prices .
I started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two .
Moules were excellent , lobster ravioli was VERY salty !
Some of the workers ignore me and talk to the female customers , other times , they 've skipped my order .
We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town .
I liked the beer selection !
While it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude .
I did n't go there for food so I ca n't comment .
In addition , the food is very good and the prices are reasonable .
I am bringing my whole family back next time .
I had the tuna tartare with sake , mushroom ravioli with pinot noir , and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $ 49 .
This is the best unknown restaurant in and around New York .
We picked it randomly , without a recommendation from someone who has been there , so we were n't sure what to expect .
When I 'm feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office , I head for Cafe St. Bart 's .
Do n't ever bother - the drinks were awful , but it was the people who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining .
I really loved the different and inovated touch that 's the cheff gives to the food .
It was nice and fresh , but I ca n't give it high scores on being authentic thai .
We were seated next to a couple whose kitchen was being renovated and we agreed since we 're all foodies who eat out a lot - that this was n't a place we 'd return to .
PERFECT FOR DATES !
I lOVE THIS PLACE !
then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi .
The establishment scores big points in presentation and style .
Skip this location and go to the one in Soho .
I recieved prompt service with a smile .
And it was quick which is very important .
While the room is not particularly comfortable , once you 're seated you 'll forget about everything except what 's on your plate .
I showed it to the manager , and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts ( but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for ) .
I 've been to at Cafe Spice probably 5-8 times , it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square .
A pleasant surprise .
I recommend the jelly fish , drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings , certainly the stir fry blue crab .
This quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my Manhattan restaurant list .
Service was very good - prompt , attentive and non-intrusive .
get over it !
My husband said the portions were very small , but if my main course was good to eat the portion would 've been fine for me .
Immediately after we paid , the waiter took the money and said , okay , you guys are outta here .
Frankly , the chinese food here is something I can make better at home .
Two complaints - their appetizer selection stinks , it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu .
Heartland Brewery is by far one of the best places in NYC to make new friends and catch up with old ones .
Found service above average , but that could be because we were 13 of us .
Anytime and everytime I find myself in the neighborhood I will go to Sushi Rose for fresh sushi and great portions all at a reasonable price .
It 's a great place to order from or sit-in .
The design is very intimate and romantic .
We all ordered different entrees so we could share .
Overall , the ingredients and technique are there and I am encouraged enough to return at lunch or dinner to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves .
When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets , and then ordered for them .
Warning : You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu !
Three strikes and this restaurant is out .
After that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it !!!!!!!!!!!!
There are a few Italian employees who may not speak the best English but for me that adds to the experience .
Spice is great Thai food , love the inexpensive appetizers .
Ciao Bella
They do n't concern much of customer 's health , just want to make money .
excellent tapas at great prices , romantic , small but not overly crowed , excellent
You 're going to drop some coin , but completely worth it , especially if you are looking to impress someone .
We were there March 7 and found Maison very nice .
Innovations are just as assured , from the simple Carinthia cheese ravioli with wild mushrooms to the caviar-topped sturgeon , beautifully matched with a bright green spinach-vodka sauce .
Ambiance is barely romantic but management tries .
highly recommended .
I have eaten at Saul , many times , the food is always consistently , outrageously good .
Beef noodle soup is good as well .
They need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the place is consistent .
I have NEVER been disappointed in the Red Eye .
Love Pizza 33 . .
Go here if you want fresh and tasty salads of any type you can imagine .
This is also where I was from .
amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages PLEASE do yourself a favor and check this place out !!!!
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect , which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me , i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water , or the check .
The service was pretty poor all around , the food was well below average relative to the cost , and outside there is a crazy bum who harasses every customer who leaves the place .
They are tasty , but I suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average American digestive system .
Before the place did n't call my attention .
So close , but not good enough .
Ca n't wait to go back .
Great vibe , lots of people .
Its not the same if you have to sit inside .
I 've had the chicken with garlic sauce , chicken with black bean sauce , and hunan chicken .
this is can became on e of the NY Italian Food fare institutions .
Our first greeting when we entered was The last call is at 10:15 .
I would highly recommend Nina 's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming surrounding filled with candles and family pictures .
Service was on par but not wonderful .
You are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but : Cassuolet , Steake Fritte , Tripe Stew , etc ; simple stuff .
the dinner menu offers a variety of great entrees , including fresh seafood and huge steaks , there 's also a couple of non-meat alternatives .
It was n't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it 's simply repulsive .
The service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served .
I visit New Green Bo when I have money or when I am broke .
Just go to Yamato and order the Red Dragon Roll .
We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria , but facing away from the bar when we turned back around , the $ 2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it .
We had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses !
They had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice - RESULT - WE HAD LARGE CHUNKS OF BURNT RICE IN OUR SERVING BOWL .
With so many good restaurants on the UWS , I do n't need overpriced food , absurdly arrogant wait-staff who do n't recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy service , and management that does n't care .
I choose to go with one of the special , the braised lamb shank in red wine , which was excellent .
Best Indian Chinese in the city , by far !
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose .
My friends spoke so much about it for months , I finally made the time to come down ear and dine in .
Every time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street .
Then they somehow made a dry and burnt crust , around a raw and cold inside .
The wine list was extensive - though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings .
The atmosphere is unheralded , the service impecible , and the food magnificant .
I 'm partial to the Gnocchi .
Save your money and do n't waste your calories , go to Margharita 's on Washington Street instead , they have amazing food and the BEST service .
My chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily .
go here for the drinks !
A must try !
The food was good , the place was clean and affordable .
I noticed alot of indian people eatting there which is a great sign for an indian place !
Average cake thats been courted by a LOT of hype .
A great way to make some money is to buy a case of snapple from Costco and sell it right outside for only $ 2.50 .
They were dry , stale and pretty flavorless .
Having been a long time Ess-a-Bagel fan , I was surpised to find myself return time and time again to Murray 's .
at taj , vegetarians can rejoice-all the dishes are manna from heaven .
Love it .
Best Pastrami I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous .
There 's nice and quiet , small but enough for 6 ( or more ) .
I find that most Kosher restaurants are average to good , but this has been the best I 've eaten so far .
The food is consistently wonderful - I 've been coming here for years , and the owner has always been accomodating and friendly .
I came across Village Underground by accident , now I go there all the time .
We left , never to return .
The lone argentine chorizo appetizer at $ 8.95 was a heavy fennel flavored Italian sausage like the ones that sell for $ 2.99 / lb at the store .
I loved it and will be back soon .
Ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me .
Restaurant was dirty and unkempt .
I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine !
They never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table .
You should pass on the calamari .
I am not the most experienced person when it comes to Thai food , but my friend who took me there is .
Service is extraordinary , yet not overbearing , and the decor brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens .
Enjoy !
Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem !
Everything I had was good , and I 'm a eater .
The cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan .
We came across this restaurant by accident while at a DUMBO art festival and thoroughly enjoyed our meal .
The waiters were not attentive except that the bill turned up on the table before we were finished .
they bring service up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small dessert for our celebration .
Go to japanese sushi place or Spanish tapas place - this creation in Williamsburg is a misstake .
I found the food to be outstanding , particulary the salmon dish I had .
Salads are a delicious way to begin the meal .
Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that .
I 'm just reading some of these reviews and its nonsense that people are reviewing some places because it was too loud .
I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of .
Dug the blue bar area too .
When we sat , we got great and fast service .
Can be a bit busy around peak times because of the size .
The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal .
The photobook menu was a cute touch , certainly helped my group and I pick the fried chicken , pork chop , and noodle dishes that we all ordered .
I was visiting New York City with a friend and we discovered this really warm and inviting restaurant .
The staff has always been friendly without seeming grating , and the chef has greeted us on a couple of occasions .
I have to agree with the previous reviewer .
I 've been coming here regularly since it opened , about 2 years ago .
great for a romantic evening , or a fun evening with friends ...
Told us to sit anywhere , and when we sat he said the table was reserved .
The food is delicious .
night without a reservation , we had to wait at the bar for a little while , but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience .
Sake collection was excellent ( Try Nanbu Bijin ) , but pricy .
The service was a bit slow and the portions are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush , this is not the place for you .
Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant !
word of advice , save room for pasta dishes and never leave until you 've had the tiramisu .
The bread is the soft paratha bread ( unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta ) , and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful .
The food here was great , a treat from beginning to end .
Succulent steaks cooked precisely to your desired ' doneness ' accompanied by salads and sides that do n't look like leafy road kill .
This is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates .
I wo n't go back unless someone else is footing the bill .
LOL
My husband and I have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the sushi bar ( chef Yoshi ) and ordered everything ala carte .
I 'll keep this short .
Great , original taste .
The food is great and reasonably priced .
Everything on the menu is great .
Every course was better than the next .
I drop more dollar bills here than your uncle after a weekend at Scores .
If you want some roast duck , pork or chicken on rice with ginger , try them out !
Give it a try , menu is typical French but varied .
Try the crunchy tuna , it is to die for .
However , if you want great food at a great price and do n't mind the decor , you ca n't beat this place .
The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .
Pizzas were excellent in addition to appetizers and main courses .
I stumbled upon this great pizzeria as I explored my new neighborhood .
I have to say the place was awesome .
but the food was delicious .
I had been searching really hard for a restaurant in New York where I could really feel unwanted and ignored and I finally found it !
And it all comes at a very reasonable price ( congee , noodles , and rice dishes are no more than $ 3-6 each ) .
I LOVE their spicy scallop roll , and my boyfriend consistently gets the sesame chicken .
Excellent experience .
And , atlhough tables opened up next to us and we ASKED for a slightly larger space , they left us awkardly seated .
Over the years the host , Vittorio , and his crew , have always treated me as family -- although with all the business this not-so-little gem does , it amazing he 's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor .
Restaurant snobs need not bother , this is a small , neighborhood kind of place .
We will definitely go back .
Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids .
Seriously , this place kicks ass .
awesome
In fact , while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu , and I could n't help telling them that the food was horrible .
The sushi has been from average to below average , the wait service has always been sub-par the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating ( if you sit in the area beyond the kitchen , the acousitcs are horrid , everything echoes is extremely loud ) .
He takes real pride in his food and his business .
This place is so much fun .
Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant .
The sandwhiches are out-of-this world !
I really liked this place .
I had the best ravioli ever .
Always great service !
Coming from Boston this place is like Emma 's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge ( although they have more funky toppings ! )
I loving bringing friends here - and I do so every chance I get .
The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you do n't like .
Molto bene !
It is thick and slightly soggy .
Sure , everyone 's got their favorite , but to know Sal , is to know New York .
It is set far from the small street it 's on , and there is no traffic noise .
Normally that would be improper , however they were all delicious and my host did not complain .
The sushi is cut in blocks bigger than my cell phone .
This place is worth going even if only for their beer .
The kitchen however , is almost always slow .
As a retired hipster , I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city .
If you are a vegetarian , this really is n't a good place to go .
The food was extremely tasty , creatively presented and the wine excellent .
in an effort to increase turnover , the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary espresso cup filled with chocolate mousse .
After a seafood craving , i checked citysearch and chose to go to Fish based on a previous review and the citysearch info .
The dim sum is ok but does n't taste that fresh , and the little dishes do n't look steamy hot as they should ( also note lack of Chinese here ) .
And comparing it to the Chinatown restaurants is simply not fair .
Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the thai food is excellent too .
Definitely worth the trip to Battery Park City !
The food is very good too but for the most part , it 's just regular food , nothing special .
But when you are seated the waitresses are great , they explain everything on the menu , and the price of the food is really cheap for the service you get .
Obv caviar is top of the line but the rest of the menu is so diverse it gives you a chance to taste so manydifferent varietys .
Overall I would recommend it and go back again .
The banana tower is an amazing dessert as well .
its a little out of the way if you do n't live in the neighborhood , but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are .
We had a 3 hour brunch - they definitely do not rush you - and they kept the unlimited mimosas flowing the whole time .
It was $ 14 not really bad for a pound of Pastrami-but it did n't have much taste-I 've had better for less elsewhere !
I am not a vegetarian but , almost all the dishes were great .
Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff .
Recommended .
No gimmicks here -- the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation .
I look forward to eating here again
But too far east !
What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka . . some of which we never received !
I would not recommend this place to anyone .
Also , do n't plan on asking for your favorite roll , if it 's not on the menu , you ca n't have it .
I was one of the people that went for this horrible experience .
The food now is inconsistent .
Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable .
We had the most wonderful waitress .
To me it exemplifies Soho , cute , artsy , interesting .
The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that I could barely eat it , and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish .
The food arrived 20 minutes after I called , cold and soggy .
Go here .
I highly recommend this beautiful place .
The second you walk through the heavy vault like door , with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime .
Stick to the gulab jamun .
I particularly love their yellowfun tuna and their mussel selection .
The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes .
The place is sleek , modern and playfull and i will return again frequently .
Jimmy is Dominican !
We have never had any problems with charging the meal or the tip , and the food was delivered quickly , but we live only a few minutes walk from them .
Where tanks in other Chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters , the tanks at Ping 's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover 's brunch .
Orsay , is a very pleasnt throw back to traditional French food , and French service as well .
In fact , it appears he is going to go postal at any moment .
I live a block away and go to Patsy 's frequently .
Bukhara is on my top 5 Indian places in NYC
Go for the Seafood Paella for two .
Whether your choose the iced blended mocha or the hot white mocha you are sure to be extremely happy .
