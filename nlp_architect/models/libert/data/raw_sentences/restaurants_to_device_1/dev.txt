the title says it all ...
note : this will add about $ 30 to the price to purchase , but worth it
i have a large collection of cds and have loaded over 100 of them so far .
you could have paid more and got a lot less .
so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .
sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .
this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .
the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
that beside you are prob. very well aware of many of the features that this phone is known for , and one that has not yet been mentioned : using this phone as a modem for any computer with a usb 1.0 port !
the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .
get it , it 's woth every penny ! !
so what ?
i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it .
as it is , i 'm keeping the machine .
i have it connected to speakers for a nice musical alarm in the morning .
in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this camera .
i first intended to buy the 3100 , but am really happy to invest the extra money for the 4300 .
the only good thing about this whole process , is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back , because of the price difference between when i bought it , and now .
9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .
i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !
a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
i have a dvd burner .
size and weight :
-- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library .
it was marked up increadably high compared to other models ( almost $ 500 for a 30gb ) , and theres was nothing about it that made it worth that much money .
had this been my only dvd player , though , it would have been a real problem .
maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .
i find this to be a great feature .
hopefully you still have the remote control .
* protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window .
as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .
overall i like it .
beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .
i will say this .
i have had no problems with the phone .
on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured .
maybe it 's good for tvs with not so good color settings , but not good for my tv that already has very vibrant pictures .
i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it !
buyer beware ! sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly ( maybe this applies to other players too , and not just the nomad , i do n't know ) .
i spent much time debating on whether i should go with the zen xtra or the ipod .
they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .
i bought the zen xtra 30g as a gift .
but that 's a moot point now .
the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .
if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are .
i 'm not sure why people have problems with either the interface of the nomad , or the software that comes with the unit .
win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs .
as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale .
but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. .
the zen has no stop button .
now i know better .
i think this is it 's biggest flaw .
this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .
it is light weight , sleek and attractive .
let me quote a customer service rep from one of the authorized apex service locations in my state ( they only service apex tv 's , not dvd players ) :
the button on the remote to switch from pal to ntsc was undoubtedly my problem .
even at the " normal " setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a " digital " .
i bought this player as a christmas present for my wife .
that 's the first thing to understand .
just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date .
i tried called apex cust service , no help .
you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit
personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors .
the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk .
this thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time .
no line out jack - as i said , there is none .
the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .
we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken .
in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .
the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera , which i do agree .
me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) .
fact is , it could n't be easier to use .
i made the mistake of thinking i could easily manage my mp3 library with this device .
sure it 's " old school " to carry a cd wallet around , but it will be easier to manage and i 'll save around 250 bucks .
it also has an optical out , which it should .
there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .
however , if anyone has participated in violent or extreme sports while using their zen , please share your experiences .
the biggest drawback that people have about the zen xtra is the software .
it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .
the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap .
next time i set it at 100 and used the flash .
once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper .
working for 10 hours with it on " shuffle " totally rocks ! !
is my unit defective ?
many people recommended the ipod , and i borrowed one from a friend .
i have used this phone for two months now .
lastly , the price is fantastic :
with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more .
i applied a $ 25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying $ 29 for this machine .
before i " get used to it " , here are my first feelings :
i have not yet tried the photo show capability , but i 'm thinking that will probably work well too , based on the success with the above mentioned disks .
i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way .
when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .
i bought this only to have it break within a month .
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year " no questions asked " replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !
i was going to get a 10gb ipod , but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com ( battery lasts 18 months ;
although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan , they still did n't ship it .
so i contacted customer service at creative , but they said , " if the product seems broken , we cannot help , " or something to that effect .
i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous .
5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control .
when talking the voice is not very clear .
despite these grieps , i still recommend the camera .
i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic .
3 . that 's pretty much all the negatives the positive things truly outnumber the negatives , and the negatives are n't that bad .
with the nomad explorer software , songs should be drag-and-drop .
the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .
the p/n button switches your dvd players video output signal between pal and ntsc .
not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording
a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .
as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .
it really does n't make any cents $ $ to build a great reputation then destroy it from lack a research and testing in one season .
my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .
uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .
having my entire music collection is great when travelling ( both on plane and car trips ) and i do n't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it 's all there .
below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends :
this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks .
this is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway .
given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .
however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond .
neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying - i 've been waiting 27 days . )
i agree with the positive reviews .
i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .
i purchased the ad 2600 from another company last month and was very satisfied with my purchase , until last night .
i think a $ 39 dissapointment is better then a $ 125 dissapointment !
+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .
zens rule .
eax on : 6 hours eax off : 8.5 hours
i have n't figured it out yet .
if anybody knows of a remote to work this-i 'd love to hear from you !
this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !
if this doesnt bring back the picture , try pressing this button without playing a dvd .
it actually gives the option to clear the previous playlist when i want to play another list .
it overrides songs so you have to go in there and put it your own titles especially if you have remixes .
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it .
you can sort your music by artist , title , album , or genre , and you can play music based on those categories .
a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine .
the price is way below an ipod of the same size .
after playing with this little device , i do n't know why i would look at an ipod with the same space when it costs $ 500 and i got mine for a little more than half that price !
i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n't do it !
the pros :
did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution .
you discover this later when you 're listening to a song and it 's the wrong title , causing you to rename everything on your own .
as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !
did i mention i 've already dropped it once ?
the menus are very easy to navigate .
the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .
and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality .
9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
only problem , if you think it 's going to be delivered in the 24hrs amazon claims , do n't hold your breath .
the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small .
i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still can 't get a video signal from the machine .
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again .
thumbs down on that one .
always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !
i like the automatic key lock function .
the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .
it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .
the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .
it only took me about 10 seconds to transfer a 200mb file .
it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
ability to play most discs - i tried dvd , vcd , dvd-r , audio cd and it played all
the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal .
it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price .
i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .
you can also set a background wallpaper .
this is the 4 apex player that i have bought .
the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .
the sound quality is very good .
this player is an ideal purchase .
the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck .
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .
radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpiece in .
here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :
anyone looking for more than " point and shoot " can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .
then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .
i should point out that the new rio karma is now down to about $ 280 and is reviewed readily as being as good as ( and better in some areas ) the ipod .
it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .
so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again .
in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking .
anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix .
if you 're a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rock-bottom price , i highly recommend this model .
the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .
i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there .
extremely convenient .
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ).
so what 's the problem ?
although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint .
if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .
if you have the appetite choose the one that you think has the least deficiencies or is best suited to you .
now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems .
connecting the same outputs to a video card in my computer , there was sound but still no picture .
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .
but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw :
oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone , but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam .
it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .
my first impression was positive .
the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) .
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .
for other problems go to http://www.apexdigitalinc.com/support.asp
9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .
i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .
i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept .
for me the sound of the music is what is important .
now , for the t-mobile service :
after having had my heart broken by a sexy piece of hardware that simply would n't perform .
i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra .
note : about 2gb ( 5 % ) of the advertised 40gb of storage capacity is used for the operating software ( firmware ) .
you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution .
the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .
what is up .
i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me .
the reasons below will be true for any product in this category .
there are plenty other features that i have n't checked out , but i 'm sure i soon will .
* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ).
it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .
i recently bought this after my archos 20 multimedia self-destructed ( do n't get me started on that piece of junk ! ) and expected it to be flawless .
t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .
the dvd player just would't recognize them .
if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one .
one horrible flaw , or mayybe more than one .
it would just spin up and stop , and display " no disc " .
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
sound quality :
this thing plays everything i feed it .
always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .
reason for two ?
guess i will return it for an exchange and hope for the best with the new one .
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .
i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer .
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .
it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .
ease of use :
alright , well i read alot of these reviews , and i read alot of bad and good things about this player .
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .
do n't buy this player .
the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )
amazon , do your customers a big favor , do n't carry this item , and give them refunds !
i have owned an apex ad-3201 for close to 3 years now and i love that deck .
navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .
i searched on the internet and found one tip which solved our problem : press i/p button on the remote control .
m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !
after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !
this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !
overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .
however , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution .
i would recommend buying one .
also , the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with .
so far so good , no problems , no conversions .
i have an older computer , running windows 98 se , and so those of you with something more recent would find the process even quicker .
this thing seriously is a good player though .
the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good .
if you are planning to buy that player , do not !
picture scrolling in b/w :
this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features .
bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better .
" check out " !
the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .
perhaps because of its smaller user base there is also a lack of accessories .
while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .
i spent $ 269 for my 30gb zx , compared to the $ 299 for a 10gb ipod and the also expensive iriver ihp-120 .
these are the reasons i think it 's great :
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .
it was always after it finished a process or something , so it did n't cause any file errors .
card reader is included .
i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control .
3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .
i got every song i had downloaded to the player within a day or so .
after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift .
the ipod also does not let you see what 's coming up next on the player .
apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r/rw and another supports - r/rw ) .
thought i 'd weigh in here with my stats .
this is one of those items that , at first glance , looked cool but did n't really ring a bell with me .
it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !
not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .
we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .
3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip .
the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try .
i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case .
i can only hear the sound .
it is not perfect though .
but for now this will do .
i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal .
i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .
video output stopped workin .
my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .
in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .
not an urgent issue , as it still works .. .
i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now .
6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) .
p.s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ?
i 'm sending this pup back to amazon and looking for the 2500 on ebay .
it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .
instead , i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in .
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use .
try to buy a high capacity ultra card , as it 's 2x as faster as the regular cf card .
removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .
and then it breaks .
its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus.
i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player .
all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved .
i bought myself an rca mp3-cd player , and i 'm happy with that until a cheap , worthwhile mp3 player coomes out .
while i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it .
i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .
btw , be sure to have your mp3 tags labled correctly , as this will ensure a great organization .
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed !
but with a low price , comes lower quality .
personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice .
it was not my first choice .
this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags , and if you 've downloaded your songs off the internet , many probably do n't .
guess where this unit is headed ?
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .
but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. .
but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !
in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .
you have to add them to the playing list .
i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything .
or better yet , buy from another company that stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty .
i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .
i wanted to use the nomad with a cassette style car adapter .
makes me use it much less than i otherwise would .
i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .
before they are sold out !
besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !
i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly .
3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players
there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !
i 'd have given it 5 stars , but i 'm waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one :
if you tossed it out the window , you need to fetch it .
reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !
i have had this player for 2 weeks , i will be returning it for an exchange in the hopes that the locking problem and scroll wheel are problems with this particular unit .
it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .
even viewed cds full of jpgs .
first of all i have been a big nokia fan and have been upgrading my cell phones about once a year ( right after the release contract is over ) .
i 've gotten used to it ( holding it in just the right realation to the ear , ducking into quieter places in bars ) but when others borrow it they 're shocked i can use it .
i set the camera to the " manual " mode for one main reason :
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .
( but as any hard drive , all of them freeze at certain points )
of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest .
the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .
i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .
the upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions .
( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . )
i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service .
i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price .
i really have no complaints over this unit .
controls easy yo use and easy to get to .
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .
i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one .
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .
a $ 300 device and they skimped on the headphone jack ?
it has a hold button to deactivate the buttons to avoid accidents ; however , enough reviewers have complained that the hold button is easily broken and then the device can 't be used .
there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) .
2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .
like the zen , the karma does not support folders and is not designed to be a data storage device .
i purchased the phone last week and have been using till then . .
if not i will avoid apex products in the future .
to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .
what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ?
truly , i am quite impressed . . ! !
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .
longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .
3 ) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year .
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .
duplicates are a no brainer and cheap .
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .
the price compared to the ipod is great .
unlike some of the other people who received a " lemon " , my dvd player came in perfect working condition .
i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard .
awful , awful , awful .
up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .
i 've tried several dvd 's and even new ones do the same thing .
it can get pretty lonely out there .
i have n't quite figured this one out yet , but it is probably operator error .
i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n't work !
2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong .
i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information .
in summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range .
4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .
i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) .
most people love the appearance and praise the touch sensitive buttons .
before jumping on the ipod train , take a look at this marvel .
but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .
i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com .
review of zen xtra - 40 gb
* software is absolutely terrible :
once you start sending files , it 'll continue until it 's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song ... at which point you can skip , skip all , replace , replace all , or cancel .
using the remote control , press the i/p button located on the bottom right corner of the remote .
this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .
it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade !
it was worth a shot -- too bad it did n't work out .
if this is your fist dvd player .
you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them .
the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .
great price .
i chose the canon speedlite 420 .
with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod .
i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .
this almost made it worth the price alone .
you can use the scene modes , or fine tune the options , i. you can change the iso level , shutter speed , etc.
i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .
very bad quality .
for a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones .
my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 " screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 " monitor .
i have an apex ad600 for a few years now which still works great today .
got it for christmas , still learning a few of the settings , but i do n't take pictures every single day .
they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling .
i hoping they will then begin building quality dvd players again , as i do like them .
i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it .
finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me !
" i 'm not sure " . ) .
the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .
it has never worked .
but , i would definately recommend this phone .
accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .
i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it .
for the money , get a better quality player .
what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies .
as i emailed to the the customer service department , the only thing this player has done consistantly is use enought electricity to keep the red led burning .
i 'm live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators .
hope i helped !
however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much .
but there are faceplates to replace it i guess ...
the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual .
so what are you waiting for ?
unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd .
i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .
i just sold my archos 20gb jukebox recorder after not being satisfied with it 's slow loading & difficult navigation , not to mention it froze quite a bit .
this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
however , i do n't know the dvd 's performance on a heavy load of every-day viewing .
i know the saying is " you get what you pay for " but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse .
i have 100 of my cd 's transferred and have n't made a dent in the 30 gb drive .
excellent idea !
i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all .
construction quality is a difficult item .
no difference .
the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly .
if creative offered a 12-month warranty on their mp3 players , i 'd be covered .
it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates .
but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything .
i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of " juice " .
overall , a good buy for the price .
there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote .
some of the more geeky ( non-apple type ) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface .
well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .
no way to contact their customer service .
my pda becames a digital album .
overall i like the unit .
the g3 looks like a work of art !
that is where my satisfaction ends .
i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it .
strengths are well listed by other reviewers .
no complaints there .
the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !
photos had some artifacts and noise .
i 'm starting to listen to cd 's that i have n't listened to in years now that i have them all handy in one place .
great camera .
subsequent behavior even worse .
if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed , i would rate this a 5 star machine .
takes excellent photos .
i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting .
this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .
one of the things t-mobile brags about is the fact that it 's a " worldphone " and can be used in europe , etc.
every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .
it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .
luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can 't .
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road !
i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .
many reviewers say the faceplate simply did n't fit well so they returned the zen .
after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .
i purchased this as a christmas gift on 12-4 - 03 .
i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it .
itunes does what apple is famous for , makes software that works for the less computer saavy .
it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .
also , there is the need to send the ipod to replace the batteries when they die ( which they will ).
once again , the sound is awesome , the batter life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life .
apex sucks !
great camera , great investment !
you need the software to actually transfer files
flash card memory vs. hard drive ( i.e. why does a 256 mb player cost $$$...and a 40 gb ( 40,000 mb ) player only cost
it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n't the only one this happened to . )
be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries .
i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions , but does n't seem any of the buget cameras do .
i eventually gave up with customer support and worked on fixing the problem myself .
i use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday .
i bought this as a gift for my sister .
the little digital elphs were the best-designed , most-elegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them .
i am bored with the silver look .
if i wasnt a runner i would take a bullet in the foot for my nomad jukebox .
anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix .
while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better .
most of the dvds i was trying were fairly new and were in great condition .
- price : see above .
the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as " sexy " looking .
seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .
simply configure the mediasource software ( or windows media player , or your ripper-du-jour ) to create file names that include artist and ( especially ) album names in addition to track names .
otherwise it 'll get there the day you get back from the hospital !
it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed-light settings .
3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .
there should have been a recall on this product .
ok , everybody loves the fm radio in this , but you want a cell phone first , right ?
i had no problems following their installation instructions .
this can be done on a song by song basis or in mass .
for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style .
i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile .
im taking mine back tomorrow morning , and getting a nice shiny new ipod instead .
i treat the battery well and it has lasted .
here 's something you have to know before you considering about buying this one .
just get some new headphones and your set .
i ordered two of these puppies for christmas gifts .
which means that in trying to save a few hundred dollars , i 'll end up spending more than twice that .
two days later the phone was returned to me in complete working order .
if i could give this a negative rating , i would .
- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well
you have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to , instead of just connecting it with a usb connection .
a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used .
the door would not close .
the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .
because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's .
after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available .
getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .
just maintain them ( phonebook , calendar and to-do list ) in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth .
the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .
great colors , pictures and white balance .
the radio feature has superb sound quality .
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .
a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins , accesses files or does antyhing .
* sigh .
bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent .
( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )
bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price .
sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization .
if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300 , i would order another just like it .
- i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull .
it always pays off .
i always shoot using the lcd panel .
i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .
it has 2 games .
software downloads on the site crashed my pc .
6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed .
it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files .
following my research , i decided on the g3 .
i bought the apex ad-2600 dvd player for the family for christmas .
navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .
it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .
the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .
( batteries last longer too ! )
the phone has several color schemes you can choose from .
overall it is the best camera on the market .
the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .
i purchased and returned this product , but not because of any glaring flaws in the design .
usb 2.0 - very fast
the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact .
the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .
i dropped it from the couch , landed on carpet and the cover and battery flew out .
i think for about $ 40 more , you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though .
1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .
i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .
the battery life on this phone is surreal .
before you try to return the player or waste hours calling apex tech support , or run the player over with your car , try these simple troubleshooting ideas first .
price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .
- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .
i 've called the service number and if it 's not busy , it rings forever then eventually dumps you .
i returned it once , then i sent it back , and it is crap .
consider it for a future gift too !
pass this player up , and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas !
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .
5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .
bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .
i am returning mine for a replacement , but if i receive another ad-2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund , but never buy another apex product in the future .
it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice .
4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .
1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .
i like to play my music by album and the nomad jukebox plays the songs in the same order as the actual cd .
so much packed in a small case and very affordable !
i bought this camera because it fit my budget and the pre-production and production model reviews were positive .
but for what i do use it is perfect .
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .
so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price !
the storage capacity is great .
this is pretty cool .
the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .
it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman .
owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide .
in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery .
while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd .
a similarily priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room .
veteran zen users have explained how to stop if that 's what you want .
also , the instruction manual is very bad .
i realize this is for quality assurance purposes , but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered ( i.e. me :
that way i could get rid of a walkman alltogether .
if i 'd been paying attention , i would have noticed the 3 month warranty .
however , if you are keen , you can attach a camera to this phone .
first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .
only con i can think of is no camera ... .
still no response .
with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .
the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla .
my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .
i purchased this as a christmas gift for my husband .
no picture :
1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 " or 5x7 " prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 " photos once in a while .
the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .
a few things that might make it even better :
the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad .
unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks .
i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .
i bought this product from amazon .
i am very pleased with it so far .
sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task .
if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ).
while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that , an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it .
here 's a basic run-down from what i learned :
the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .
this meant that i had to take all my cds and do in a fairly short period of time what i had done over a year at work .
no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .
again , though , it has only been used sparingly .
output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv .
i 'm editing my review , because now i wish i read the manual before returning the player i bought for my girlfriend .
would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .
this is almost it but not quite but the price was right .
it ships with a carrying case that has a belt clip on it .
i can 't speak to its long-term reliability , as i 've only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point .
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .
called customer service and basically was told to either keep buying univ. remotes to try or buy the replacement remote for $ 23 ( which is almost half of what i paid for the whole player ) .
somewhat disappointed that i could not " hook up " to my sony multi brand remote commander .
i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .
my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity .
is this possible to fix , if so how , if not does notmad explorer from red chair software do this ?
i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .
i followed their advice but that failed , too .
nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .
it also has unproven battery life .
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player .
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .
all in all suprisingly easy to use .
thats it .
mixed bag i guess but the price was right .
they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon 's .
the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .
cons summary :
anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net , being able to download pics and ringtones ( not java apps , you need t-zones for that ) .
do n't drop this unit :
charged my battery .
minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable .
what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
excellent range of metering options as well .
i felt that i should write this comment asap , as i am quite excited in using its features .
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .
the phone is very light weight .
i like the way apple is innovative , but let 's face it - they can 't be the only one with an idea to enclose a 2.5 " hd within an aluminum case in a stylish package for long , especially after the buzz is out of their little techie pod .
also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .
the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car .
i 'd look elsewhere .
i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box .
typically people use 96kbs to 320 kps.
one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like .
the prints are beautiful !
what a disappointment !
the interface used could be better designed .
depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .
as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .
to say the least , i was horribly dissatisified with my service with sprint , which was why t-mobile was so fantastically refreshing .
i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway .
simply not as friendly for functional as an ipod .
a good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images .
if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get " stuck " rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .
any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages .
advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .
( my orignal review is below : )
well , this apex dvd player turned out great !
i have had it lock up after a transfer of music .
good thing i got a replacement plan .
hopefully you wo n't regret .
unless your a professional , now you will need only one camera . this one .
all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .
i got it now , and i 'm diggin ' it .
i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3-year - old unit again just to see .
however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off .
night mode is clear as day .
well , not with this one .
another plus in my book , no file limits !
to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power .
this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he 'd answered all my questions ( same interaction as i just described ) , and well .. .
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .
( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . )
the dynamic playlists ( " now playing " , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. .
all rechargeable batteries lose their holding power over time ( around 2 years ) .
i 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder .. .
well , maybe that particular song was just corrupt , so i tried to upload some of my own , after four attempts , at each one the unit locked up and required a reboot , i managed to upload an album , which albeit was surprisingly fast , however when attempting to create a playlist out of my newly uploaded songs , the nomad again froze up and refused to work .
my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .
also bought a soundblaster card that they sold for the mac .
2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .
" enjoy " !
as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr .
so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty !
the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !
i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra ... and i was not disappointed .
now , even 1 star seems like i 'm giving creative the benefit of the doubt .
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .
two months ago , an internal part failed ( not due to customer abuse ; it just failed ) .
- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .
you can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions .
i do n't think i will ever use the full 30gb .
then again a one time use camera may do just as well .
the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .
great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes
i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .
i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .
after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all .
overall an excellent phone .
repair seems to be an issue ; some say the repair do n't exist
maybe more competitors will bring out similar products .
only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .
canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .
bought one for $ 49.99 .
in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .
the buttons and interface are very easy to use .
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .
i have n't checked the resilience of my xtra yet , and do n't plan to .
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category .
. if you want to have the date ; time on the image , its only through their software " nikon view " which reads the images date ; time from the images meta-data .
after i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't .
i experimented with installing mediasource on 2 other computers at home and it worked fine .
notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx .
it 's horrible .
no more annoying series of beeps .
the visceral teases include the case , the sound quality , and the capacity .
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .
otherwise , you 'll have to mess around a lot with filenames inside the ( decent ) nomad explorer , which is not fun at all .
and then you will start to belive them .
but this camera is great !
i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .
it took several days of attempts before things finally " worked " again and i have n't a clue why .
all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n't done it since .
seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection .
i highly recommend this phone to anyone .
here 's a hint : go to nokia.com and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth .
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units .
you will be sorry if you do .
the nomad is sent back to creative labs .
for prospective buyers , i would warn of the following : 1 ) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible , as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable ( this applies to earbuds in general , ) and 2 ) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them , that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves .
highly recommended .
after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( both of which lack the quality , feel , or features of the g3 ) , i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality ( resolution and coloration are superior ) .
i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99 .
1 ) price / gb of storage
i would suspect that there are similar problems with all of the other brands as this is somewhat new technology .
i ended up sending the unit back to amazon .
i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .
do not buy this product --
i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .
try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems .
in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom .
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all .
transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .
the trouble shooting section in the user 's manual , suggesting correct and secure connections , does n't help .
it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .
4 ) it did play my jpeg photos but wow , trying to figure it out was really something !
otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .
i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it 's job .
i currrently have service with t-mobile , verizon , and t-mobile .
prior to my switch to t-mobile , sprint was my service provider .
the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode .
however , i should have followed my instincts :
spend the extra 20 $ and buy a name brand dvd player .
i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit .
i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty . ( it 's fast too ! )
guess all that glitters is not gold .
hopefully the replacement from amazon will work just fine .
go for it !
so i 'm screwed .
considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
if you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now , but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you .
i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience .
nice little phone ... light compact . .
the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .
could not stop it , could not get out of the " now playing " screen .
i did everything i could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader .
little inconveinent , but unlike other players i only paid 40 $ .
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon .
it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .
the fact that the " 0 " key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the " # " key instead .
many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .
great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .
this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve .
i was told that it is no longer available , so there must be something really wrong with it .
if that is for you then pay the money , learn from the experience and you 'll be a more informed buyer when you buy device # 2 .
in general it is easy to use and well laid out .
i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) .
tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .
4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .
i am still trying to figure out the may options it has .
i also did n't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode .
i have not yet discovered the internet features yet , which i will be doing soon .
this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ).
the workaround is to update id3 tags on your files ( through mediasource ) but it can be a hassle if you have many such music files .
i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .
4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying .
( wo n't leave copy on your computer . )
it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .
one thing that i found out recently is that you do n't need t-zones from tmobile to go online .
it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !
- included creative software is pretty poor .
the software is great .
after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it .
software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better , but costs money )
also , if i had already loaded and tagged by cds on my home computer , this would not have been an issue .
i guess that i can not complain since it does not actually claim to play vcd / svcd formats , but others say they can .
compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use .
the batteries would not charge .
it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .
i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem .
the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .
but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .
here 's where the ipod drives me nuts .
80 % of the features on here you will not get by spending $ 100 on a sony or panasonic .
and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .
hope this review has helped you in making up your mind .
+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .
it suppose to play everything .
bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .
the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .
( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n't play and they were new ones !
i received this dvd player free with the purchase of a palm tungsten e from officemax .
overall , a very disappointing product .
it plays all my back-ups , + or - , and everything else i have put in it without a hick up .
i doubt anyone has ever seen an add or commercial for any other mp3 player .
i can only hear the sound but no picture !
+ you can have different kind of lens if you want + flashes , etc.
headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .
i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .
structurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you .
like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels .
great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer , and then transfer them to a friend 's .
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .
i should n't have been cheap , should have bought a toshiba .
for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .
i had downloaded about 1000 songs and had room for another 9000 !
i am enjoying my phone a lot ....
3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .
after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us .
i finally returned the unit to the company along with copies of my messages and return info .
how did this gigantic flaw go unnoticed by creative ?
i was , however .
you just have to use the lcd viewfinder to see the whole picture .
i did n't use it long enough to know , but clearly you need to use it with caution .
it was either the 40gb ipod or this one .
in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries .
the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .
now as others said , so far this player is an awesome player , there are flaws .
overall , i highly recommend this phone .
i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever .
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .
it 's no problem for me personally .
i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media .
a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .
my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up .
the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .
drop if just a few inches on a hard surface and the faceplate pops off ( but not if it 's in its case ) .
had i not been in such a hurry to load cds , i would have spotted them sooner .
4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .
i end up unplugging it from the wall for a few hours and when i try again it will work fine.at least until this problem arises again .
one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing .
it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there .
what a junk .
i used a canon powershot s20 for about 2.5 years and loved it !
it defaulted to unchangeable email .
i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera .
plays them all .
now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos .
i called them twice and both times they said it is " about to ship " .
the ad-1600 did n't work corectly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up .
i doubt i will use half of the storage capacity , but you never know .
in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .
the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful " scene " mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless .
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 .
it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .
fiance did n't like the feel .
no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .
after the first one fatally crashed , the replacement did not work .
i personally do n't like apple or their business practices ( screwing resellers , customers and employees left and right ) so i shopped around for something else .
the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .
finally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing .
basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 .
but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n't anticipate any problems with it .
if it had the same number of " ? " s then it would ask if you want to overwrite another song that just had the same number of " ? " s. . .
unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds. even though they were not damaged in any way .
one word of caution with regards to using the nomad with itunes .
mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them .
it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .
there 's a dent on the upper-back-right and lower-back-right corners ... not too obvious unless you 're up close .
about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .
battery life is good for a phone of this size .
if you have any multi-disc box sets , you 'll notice that the artist 's name , album name , and genre will often change with every disc .
it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here .
the nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six .
with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation .
both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610 .
i didnt wait to experiment .
this is especially useful for those who listen mostly to pop music and store all those short ditties .
oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy .
i enthusiastically recommend this camera .
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
song transfers were not an issue .
try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .
this is not a handbag camera .
overall design :
a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models .
i did buy the telephoto lens ( and the required extension ) .
if it were not for that i would have given it 4 .
i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ?
i do n't care how it looks and i always drive so the size is not important to me .
the image quality is excellent .
so it is probably " just bad luck " on my part that the personal notebook i own had this install error .
but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .
you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though .
is eax faulty ?
i was a little disappointed in the low end .
its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .
it has a nice color screen .
i think you get what you pay for stands true .
all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .
however , the creative software is not real intuitive .
my opinions :
if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe .
the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .
the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .
when the previous versions of the zens were shipped with musicmatch , people had this problem because musicmatch creates both sets of tags , which seem to confuse the zen xtra .
perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy " off " brands .
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .
- uploading music is quick and easy .
although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .
whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .
but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .
the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .
i did already have mediasource installed due to owning the creative audigy 2 soundcard but i did need to re-install it from the supplied cd as the older version did not have the connector to the zen .
for the money apex machines have good features .
it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .
first there 's the unit itself .
this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .
