not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem .
the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc.
i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name .
i also registered the unit online and posted two messages to the apex support person ( there can 't possibly be more than one !
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money .
also , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability .
for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house , that one didn " t work either !
( i guess only time will tell ? )
i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember :
i checked with nokia .
i was immediately interested in the 6610 .
4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .
i purchased this unit 3 months back and i think the unit knew when my warrenty expires .
as soon as i lifted the unit out of the box , i questioned my judgement .
the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .
this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial . its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll .
that is a very nice feature .
so if you have xp , be prepared for this and do n't be alarmed .
it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves .
it focuses in a snap .
it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .
having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .
i have n't figured out if this is the case for all the songs on itunes .
the movie mode is also working great .
5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .
worth every penny !
i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) .
thank you very much , and go out and get yourself a nomad !
made the camera totally inoperable .
to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .
player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play .
this is my fourth mp3 player ( creative nomad jukebox2 and 3 , rio chie , and this one ) , and my third player from creative .
yes the ipod is smaller , but not $ 200 worth , which is the premium you 'll pay for an equivalent capacity model .
although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent .
bait and switch .
although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular .
what the heck is up with the 2600 .
having said that , this is what you do . " add to cart " !
ipod has no stop button ; when new users mention this ipod veterans call it " unnecessary " and " so 20th century " .
there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board .
the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .
the higher the number the better the quality ( less data compression is used ) and the larger the file size .
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .
i guess i 'm just lucky to get a good working unit !
there is usb , though .
we got a familyplan from t-mobile which saves us tons .
the controls definately took some getting used to .
after about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player .
navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .
just be aware of it .
yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .
basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n't used .
i definately recommend a large memory card .
i 'd like a camera phone , but i 'd rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls ...
i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .
forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds.
and does n't need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does .
after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .
you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
( did i mention you can actually change the battery ? hello ? apple ? are you listening ? )
i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know .
i spoke to a rep. at apex and was told that a new format is being used and we wont be able to view any disney movies made in the last couple months .
other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .
the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings .
1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )
the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive .
in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .
plugged it in .
set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week .
5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .
at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my " alias " dvds as well .
short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .
i am still trying to resolve it four months later .
player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 .
also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 " tv ).
despite all the hype about ipods , i knew i wanted something different , because i wanted more storage than the ipod i could afford would offer , and because i wanted more flexibility in where i purchased music online .
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .
i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter 's birthday party without switching out to my backup battery .
so far the software for the pc works easily .
1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?
my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone .
canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives .
( 1 gb = 1,000 mb )
prior to christmas , it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad !
weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] .
the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key ) .
over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !
i love this player .
four megapixels is great .
i should have looked at it harder .
very cheaply made .
with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet .
i wanted a dvd player that had basic features and would be able to play dvd - r format disc 's that i had made myself .
you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .
i purchased one of these to replace an ailing dvd player that 's a few years old .
the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to .
a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on " normal " resolution .
my brother bought an ipod this past summer and my dad bought the original zen around the same time ..
save yourself some aggrivation .
i dare you to surf the net and find the code .
however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .
it 's a winner .
you can 't find the mpeg playback on high priced units .
after that it seems like you 're on your own .
the second one was the 2500 which i think is better than the 2600 because it has more features such as karoake which i do use sometimes for parties .
it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs .
overall this is a slightly better than average phone .
the t610 has the most functionality hands down .
i 'll have to see if this becomes a problem down the road .
the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .
battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .
it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something .
i first bought a 6 gig nomad jukebox ( original ).
this explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players .
based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .
after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another , i got fed up and have decided to return the phone .
i love the pros and cons reviews so here ya go :
2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .
a card with more memory is a must .
i highly recommend the accessory kit , which provides you with everything else you need :
in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .
i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .
very large pics take 8mb each !
a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop
things that i 'd prefer different - there 's a red light that shines when it 's turned off !
i purchased two apex 2600 for christmas presents .
please go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story .
this is nothing new , every mp3 player , memory card , etc. , used for digital media today has some kind of preloaded operating software on it .
when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .
for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c .
unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .
i paid $ 49 and now it 's $ 125 !
i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
however , the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems .
it 's a dedicated music playing device , anyway , so this serves it better .
please , if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions , i 'm wait very happy .
no instructions .
i 've owned 6 or 7 dvd players since 1998 .
4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
i give it 10 stars !
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's .
the only drawbacks that i have noticed :
it took maybe 15 minutes to transfer 1000 songs .
for me , i 'll save that cash for another purchase .
i have to rip everything as a 160 kbps wma file ( as opposed to 128 kbps mp3 ) to avoid hearing digital garbling .
5 hours max. i did it like this
i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software .
when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture !
on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .
well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players .
like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it .
then it rips the tunes into mp3s and puts them on your computer .
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n't had any problems .
i purchased this player last week .
all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift .
i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .
so i do n't know what the previous review that could n't do more than 30 songs is talking about .
a disipointed customer .
i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes .
( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too .
i did that and re-installed the software but had the same error .
the software has n't been a hassle for me at all .
8 battery life is excellent .
the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .
if you plan to carry the device around ( it is a mobile device , right ? ) then this is something you might want to think about .
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying .
door broke after a month .
i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !
the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd .
the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .
you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do .
is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ?
nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes , medium; compact size , price , brand name , good software that is included and previous reviews .
3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything .
do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype .
i am extremely satisfied with this camera .
the sound from the player is ok .
so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem .
now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school !
now , i suddenly have no picture .
the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .
save money on the long run - buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month .
a big plus in my book .
therefore , if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card , even if you unlock the phone , there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet .
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .
i particularly like the " txt " file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take .
eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs ( reviewers figures )
i made an additional five attempts at creating a playlist , before packing the unit up and heading over to amazon 's product return page .
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .
when i turned eax back on the static was also not present .
player controls :
there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted .
once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers .
this is an edited review , now that i have had time to use the device .
this was not a problem for me as most of my collection was ripped from my own cds and i updated the id3 tags on my downloaded music .
otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward .
the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .
the g2 was better in this respect .
it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .
1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .
it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds .
then sorting the files is easy as pie .
the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .
i do n't have a dvd + r to try
apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .
everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem .
seemed like a good deal , but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes , " no disc " .
anyway , the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago - you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product .
it did lock up on me a couple of times .
for example , jimi hendrix 's 2 cd live at the fillmore east had one cd classifed as classic rock and the other psychidelic rock .
* main dial is not backlit .
point the " media sniffer " to your music files and let it do the rest .
my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
2 . the speed is noticeably slower than canon , especially so with flashes on .
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package .
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .
the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .
also , if you 're an audiophile , you 'll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short .
it plays alternate video formats ( vcds , svcds , cvds ) very well .
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .
no-one mentions whether there is a stop button , but the photos do n't show one .
seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) .
i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company , some models are better than others .
like most people , i do n't want to read the instructions , i just want to use it .
after charging my card for the camera and for expedited shipping , 5 business days later , they still had n't shipped the product .
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .
press the p/n button located on the bottom right corner of the remote .
unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved .
3 ) 4x zoom is nice
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .
i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone .
when plugged in , it does n't lag the computer like the archos did ... unless you are doing a massive transfer of data in one load .
there was very little light in there .
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .
is it a coincidence that i no longer can get any of your nomad zen xtras ( worst name ever ) at best buy and now the 60gb nomad xtra is " sold out " or more likely " discontinued " at the almighty amazon.com ?
i will never buy another apex digital product !
usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast .
it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches .
at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe 's photoshop elments 2.0 software , and can 't praise it highly enough .
which was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone ...
it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .
- outstanding signal reception
i am quite happy with the camera .
i purchased this mp3 player just last night after doing some scouting around .
for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .
btw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information .
an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into " out of battery " situation .
i would be nice to have a simple fm receiver so i could pick up local stations .
it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .
also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .
if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 !
i have done some research and experimenting with the remote when my apex ad-2500 seemed to have lost its video signal .
if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for .
be forewarned .
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .
i 've even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive .
it also lets you remove songs from the play order .
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .
highly recommended !
although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .
and also , it 's priced very affordably .
it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy .
when i turned eax off the static disappeared .
some of my friends had well branded dvd-players but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks !
otherwise feedback seems to be good .
as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you wont scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys .
i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags .
the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .
it takes great pictures .
i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .
a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer .
at this time , i decided to turn the player on , and much to my surprise it comes with quite the little library of classical music , one of which is a childhood favorite , bach 's air .
the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked .
1 ) fm receiver - some models out there have this .
to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod .
but heck it plays my alias dvds .
this is not a player you can take jogging .
3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .
people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone .
one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing .
1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool .
it 's almost like having a media player / file manager built into the dvd player .
- the unit is easy to use and intuitive .
different people have different needs , of course , but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive .
the headphone jack acts as a pseudo line out jack .
the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing .
some dvd 's i rented would not play .
simple to use and hook up .
wo n't play a lot of discs .
one bad thing though , i find the remote control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does .
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .
i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs , which is an unaccustomed luxury , even with t-mobile service .
great phone , i 'd buy another .
those that have it like it .
aight den bumpy ?
do n't waste your money .
i do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand .
after a lot of research , i decided on the g3 .
if you 're investing in a camera at this level , buy this software !
creative provided e-mail support ;
this is ridiculous .
a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included .
so consider what you 're going to use the device for .
and no t-zones .
forget about it .
one thing puzzles me is that for " fine and 2200 + " quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .
it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly .
it will not load any further songs on and customer service has no idea what to do .
i bought this phone when it first came out in the summer .
well , anyway i could go on and on on why this player did n't meet my expectations .. .
nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon .
i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus .
- some features in the user interface
one minor complaint :
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :
getting the printer to help output them was another tale .
so you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter , but you do n't get the quality from a true line out jack .
the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance .
i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered .
take the time to fill in those tags !
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows " no disc . "
update : apple recently announced that for $ 107 , it will replace the battery in ipods shipped to their factory .
they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .
i am very pleased with its quality and durability .
i am really impressed by this dvd player .
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong .
enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
( 28 not 30 because software itself takes space ) .
if it can fit in the drive bay , this dvd player will play it .
not sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear .
i originally purchase a 30 gb nomad zen xtra as a portable mp3 player .
that meant even less light and just as much action .
- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .
finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 .
i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .
in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself .
i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .
-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .
if you have a good digital camera , there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone .
the nokia , samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do n't talk too much .
so i do n't understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them .
some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get .
the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering !
playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .
4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ).
or does it play audio and video but scrolling in black and white ?
( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however )
i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year .
none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers - you cannot make changes on the ipod that are premanent .
the description of the warranty is buried on the supplied set up cd .
i purchased a jukebox 3 from creative almost a year ago .
pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent .
i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots .
i just transfered over some 40 cds and have plenty of space left for me .
like other reviewers , installation was hell .
the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .
the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .
when it arrives , you press the shutter release .
it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid .
oh well ..
. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image
in my case , the bill was $ 81 , about a third of what i paid for it .
by pressing p/n , you should be able to get a good picture on the screen .
i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since .
creative labs customer support website is useless .
it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .
perhaps there is a tone of irony in the title of my review , but i actually mean it in earnest .
first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .
just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos .
i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .
well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .
now what about the flash problem ?
the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god .
and so far , i 've been very pleased .
the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .
at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .
on an average , you would charge it once a week .
2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow .
the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .
another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
you are not able to simply import files , but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them .
amazon is awaesome !
keeps coming up with no disk errors .
before anyone says hey you have n't used the product , i have , my friend received one for christmas instead of an ipod and has since envied me for my vastly superior product .
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .
if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it .
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain .
i am not associated with the company , i am not providing a url , but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily .
great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .
great job canon !
wow , dennis sure is great !
so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one .
i also had it happen when recording a jazz set where there were a number of outtakes of the same song without numbering them separately .
i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along .
you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player .
zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .
i replaced it with this not-quite-so-dazzling , but definitely more functional device .
now i dont have to lug around 80 cds if i dont know what i 'm going to want to listen to biking home .
i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .
after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd .
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .
the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .
besides user error ( surprise , surprise ) , it 's hard to imagine people having trouble with either .
a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names .
it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :
creative tech support operators work 9-6 p.m. weekdays - as if i had time during work hours to spend time on this .
in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
2 ) fm transmitter - so you can place the unit in your car and listen to the unit through your car stereo .
if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .
i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .
if only it played stand alone avi files .
yes , i recommend it over the competition .
i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery , so it 's good to go on a long vacation .
this thing , while looking pretty cool , is not as sexy as the ipod .
even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal .
the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .
i call apex customer service and they told me that there is a known problem with the model playing disney and other movies and that it is not there problem so i 'm stuck with a new dvd player that wo n't play my kids disney movies .
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par .
i did n't had any problem till now .
if you 're like me , that will definitely make you pause .
the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .
their customer service is very poor .
i even went as far as calling the technical support number on the disc .
nothing but hassle with this company .
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .
first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .
after i went through the transer issue , i returned the zen xtra and purchased the 40 gig ipod .
so if you use your card reader ; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date ; time .
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime .
i wanted it to shoot concerts as well .
its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .
get better headphones .
i 'll just say this .. .
the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on .
it 's not the end of the world , but a better design sure would be nice .
i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .
and have returned both .
i only have one question , when i add tracks to my nomad , via nomad explorer , they are automatically put in alphebetical order , rather than album order .
can 't say whether i rec 'd an " updated " model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me .
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work .
when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff .
amazon has been working with me to refund my money , but they reminded me that i have past the 30 day return policy and this was a courtesy return .
it took over 2 months and repeated follow-up to get it replaced .
this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records .
so far i 've only had it since christmas , so i cant tell you much about the battery life .
how does it sound ?
lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .
loved the slim design .
the camera has a wonderful set of features .
so far the player froze on me once ( i started pushing buttons before it loaded ) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that .
there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free .
i am not talking milliseconds .
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation .
songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver .
you can 't simply open up a folder from the player and play all the songs in it .
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .
i 've been using it for about 3 months now .
i was surprised by t-mobile 's service .
this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters .
i got this dvd player as a gift and had to send it back .
you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country .
other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .
grandma in church quiet .
the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . "
had it for a week .
looking at the glowing reviews from people that have had this for a week or two , i kind of wish people would wait until they 've had a product a little while to review it .
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .
it worked .
this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas .
i had been comparing the 3650 , 3560 and the 3595 but could n't settle ... then along came the 6610 , which was perfect for me .
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .
there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk !
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .
i was so excited about the price and reviews of this dvd player .
whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox , it dumps all of them into a single folder , and then sorts them by the id3 tags.
downloads are a snap and quick .
the second one is up and running .
usually around the time the 90 day warranty expires .
by the way my alias dvds are legit too not no bootleg from the internet .
overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .
the top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable .
and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ).
at my heaviest usage , i must recharge after 3 days .
i suppose that you could jog with it but it seems to be made for the enjoyment of music .
this is possible ! !
this seemed like a really good compromise .
the other company is currently " out of stock " so i ordered another from amazon and will be taking the original back to the competitor today .
dim or bright , it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out , after the tae kwon do kick broke the board .
5 for " digital film " it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome .
when i first purchased the unit i downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website .
the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .
the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .
best electronic i 've bought since i was born .
the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .
had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .
olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body .
i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time .
contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .
i would n't gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas .
use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run .
even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .
the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .
buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever .
nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .
the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons .
the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .
with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .
look / design :
the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist , track name and album name .
very simple to use .
notmad has other features too , but this is not an advertisement so please see the company 's web site for more information ...
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
they sell an adapter unit to use with your car 's cassette deck .
this is not the same thing as a film camera .
after much frustration ( above ) i found the notmad explorer ; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer & organization problems .
however , it serves its purpose .
you might think you are saving money by buying an apex but in the long run you will spend more .
although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .
can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go .
i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .
( throw a cell phone and you 're asking for trouble . ) 3a .
nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality .
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything .
the most important thing for me is sound quality .
got a great deal from a reputable seller .
the dvd player is fine .
if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty .
i bought this for my dad for christmas .
3 ) folders cannot be created for the audio files .
2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .
we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working .
excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .
creative is talking about updating it via firmware , however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players , looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates , not too much of new features .
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it .
3 ) you must press the play button and hold it for a couple of seconds otherwise it will not work and you will think the whole unit is broken .
anyway , on with the review .
the vibrate setting is loud !
it lasts , truly , 7 days on standby .
it 's bigger , but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it 's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods .
for the most part this is a good dvd player .
the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .
ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .
cleaned the dvd , tried again , no luck .
you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself .
almost half what an ipod would cost you !
the camera was a marvel .
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad .
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box !
the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .
again , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional .
1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .
a 256 mb player ( roughly 60 songs for me ) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb ( 30,000 mb ) player ( roughly 6,650 songs ) sells for only slightly more .
they piggy-back on cingular 's service .
it wo n't play 80 % of my movies , which are all store boughten .
we 'll see if i need them to .
i agree with previous posts that you get what you pay for .
how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu ?
this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver .
d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on
fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
i considered this phone ( nokia 6610 ) , mainly because of my sister and the features .
the other controls are all very easy to use .
thankfully amazon has free return shipping !
no go on most formats .
overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .
usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it .
i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily .
i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .
the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it .
if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating .
this dvd play is basicly junk .
it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls .
i returned to the store , whereupon the clerk insisted that he could make it work ; he could n't .
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision .
their website does not show it as a compatible phone , and should i try to access the game downloads on t-zones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported .
i bought this to replace an expensive ( $ 300 + ) onkyo dvd player that quit after only 3 years !
7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook .
third party software to the rescue
i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .
do n't get me wrong , the thing was like heaven for about a week .
even if there happened to be identical track titles on the same disc , you could still edit the file name manually and get them both onto the player .
e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage
karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity .
anyway , im gon na go find dennis now , have a nice day ! ! !
what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .
after reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common .
i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player .
so how can i do that ... are n't that free for two after the rebates .
after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews .
the phones are awesome .
my sister was able to figure it out on her own as well , and she is of average computer competence .
much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate
you do n't have this problem if you make your playlist from the nomad , where cds are listed separately .
think you need to pay a fortune for a good qulaity dvd player ?
recently , i attended a " flyball " competition
it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
this was the closest alternative and best buy for this type .
so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can 't use nomad until you get home .
i have my mp3 's stored on my workstation .
this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
that said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory .
sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much .
great design and looks cool .
not many .
i cancelled the order .
prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture .
i 'll state up front that i do not own a zen xtra and have not used one at all .
great features . .
ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet .
creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static .
audio is excellent .
pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?
amazon was supposed to send me another one , but did n't and sent me a gift certificate instead ( i 'm guessing because the price has gone up on this unit since december ).
im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button !
when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with .
1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office .
as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .
i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar .
this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it .
i purchased the nikon 4300 after several weeks of searching .
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it .
if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books .
so i pop-in my first dvd and start to watch .
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .
this would not be a great problem if you did n't have so much info to scroll through on a regular basis .
i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died .
the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .
the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .
i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .
the vibration is not top .
i used it lightly , and it lasted just over one year ( forgot to kill the power one day , and now it only plays dvds ).
installed software .
- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .
notmad worked right away after install and it is what i would like to see from the product .
a great deal in general !
else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately " fine **" picture quality " image size : 1600 .
i have not used the progressive scan feature .
using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account .
again , you can change this , but it 's harder to spot a minor variation in the title when you do n't have the title of the other disk in front of you .
the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful .
after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. .
apple 's solution - pay apple another $ 400 + for a new ipod ( less a paltry discount ) .
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it .
2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .
it practically plays almost everything you give it .
but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it !
friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased .
i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .
one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) .
this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500 .
you can change any of these , but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it .
the downside though , may be a big one for you .
it do n't get any better then the nikon 4300 .
i have a 128mb card in it and can shoot over 150 hi res photos .
i went to an at &#38; t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads .
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did .
i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective .
i am a software engineer and if i wrote an interface to my software that worked like this , there would be hell to pay , not to mention the ridicule from my peers .
get one now !
after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .
the reception and sound quality are top-notch .
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings .
all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
before i decided to get this player , i did my research .
for work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well .
i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .
the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition .
b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display
the fm radio is cool .
it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working .
it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life .
for those of you who has problems with this player , i 'd suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture , etc.
- best in class sound
the included memory card is too small .
i am going to have to try an online download and see if that works .
even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
also , very light and portable .
i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product .
it goes nicely with my apex 27 " in my bedroom .
my goal of using it as a music player * and * data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake .
the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .
so now it still plays everything , you just can 't see it !
the " scene " mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a " regular " setting .
for an early christmas gift , i got a zen xtra 40 gb player .
it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .
if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera .
we tried the " finding nemo " dvd and when we got to ~ chapter 28 , the frames started to freeze for no reason .
+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit
the rio karma feedback suffers from sensitivity in the hard disk .
it wo n't play all of my movies .
well , it was nice while it lasted .
navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .
and then it just froze and now i 'm out $ 300 for their piece of junk .
yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .
excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography .
i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one .
this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways .
this is a great camera for you !
best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .
it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !
after investigating a multitude of player options , i asked for and received the 60 gb zen xtra for christmas .
the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling .
this phone is a winner ...
but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .
if it does , ill give up .
i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .
it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose .
one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .
at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast !
save them on computer and print out just the ones who want .
i intend to contact the company , but from what i 've read .
i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .
these problems were consistent , and also not present on another dvd player .
not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .
the volume .
7 picture quality is excellent .
you will be told goldstar codes work , and you will be told zenith codes will work , and radio shack will give you apex codes but they will not work .
so , if you read the instructions well , you should n't have any problems with this dvd unit .
3 ) user replaceable battery
the case had ad2600 .
for three months , i 've researched the internet and magazines , queried various sales personnel , and took hands-on in-store test drives .
having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers .
no matter the format .
red chair 's notmad explorer is great & recommended by about every reviewer to repleace the creative jukebox software .
it 's money down the drain .
they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy .
i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason .
i love the storage in this thing .
transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 .
both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going .
i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .
good points :
disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone .
i listened to it for several days before needing to recharge them .
why i do n't can this product without a plan ?
yup , right back for a refund !
excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players .
then you can say , " my dissapointment only cost $ 39 . "
sheesh ! !
i bought this last week through amazon .
it plays everything , even vcd 's .
a dock is unnecessary as the charger and usb cable do the necessary .
all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product .
i hope i have helped you continue to enjoy the apex dvd player with these troubleshooting tips .
i would recommend replacing the existing software with the " notmad explorer , " which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .
i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover .
but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle .
if you are n't into paying $ x00 to learn and experiment , or the cons outweigh the pros , then wait a year or so .
when i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small .
i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !
my one recommendation to creative is to get some marketing people to work on the names of these things .
this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure .
small problem .
people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .
what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy .
i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .
crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time .
it only took about 30 minutes to download everything , and that was about 950 songs .
after receiving the box from amazon , i proceeded with charging the unit for the specified 4 hours , after which i installed the software and connected the unit to my pc via usb 2.0 .
the quality is superb .
however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .
simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend .
do not buy this player .
frequent signal searches eat up battery power .
i recently bought the nomad jukebox zen xtra , and did n't even get as far as charging the battery .
i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either .
lot 's of other features that i need to find out about .
get cheaper panasonics or toshibas or even sonys .
first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .
very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has .
my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the " year " field .
i highly regret trying to save a few $ with this purchase .
it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .
hopefully , this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod .
first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. .
the i/p button switches the tv display between interlace and progressive .
get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash .
this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .
to me this alludes to the manufacturer 's confidence that the product will last for a year .
the ipod is also an attractable piece , being lightweight and small .
the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .
i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 .
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera .
i am even a bit technology oriented , so i thought it would be a breeze to set this up .
the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .
also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore " the " when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .
works great !
i waited a few years between phones , mostly because ( like most i think ) i didnt really need one .
it works great .
here were my requirements in a digital camera :
all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet ; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while .
a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film .
way less expensive than the ipod .
- the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .
huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you .
i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. .
i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones .
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .
also , i downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates .
i purchased it at a retail store , and got an extended warranty .
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .
assuming you have filled in all the id3 tags on your mp3s , you will not have any problem finding them on your zen xtra .
i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .
and since the current language selection was english ( even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were " ? " s and even though the songs had different names in chinese ..
that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw .
though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display " lens " when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself .
i accually did n't buy the apex ad-2600 from amazon but , the reviews i found here helped me purchase it .
i use my own mid-priced headphones rather than the enclosed earbuds .
the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .
it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !
left it set on my desk came back five minutes later and it just wanted to keep playing the same song over and over .
features that would have been nice :
only one disk played through to completion successfully .
now i may buy two !
the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .
the distortion is not a flaw .
great phone .. .
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .
the remote is a little hard to understand .
so buy the g3 .
i can 't comment on the quality of the audio , because it was back at the store before i ripped a single cd .
* price and capacity
strike 1 .
i thought it would be haggard but when i be gotted this junky i was mad happy and stuff .
but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. .
i called creative and they said to send it in and they would decide if it in warranty .
when the player was working it was great ,but .
i was a little concerned to be the black sheep buying this player instead of the incredibly overpriced apple i-pod .
within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob .
no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic 's for just a couple of keepers .
and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .
+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
negative points :
the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .
i guess you get what you pay for .
it 'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it .
mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs .
i downloaded the trial version , and after less than 10 minutes of using it , decided it was well worth the price .
finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier .
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .
started ripping and transferring .
from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles .
the price / performance looked just right .
but i did n't because i 'm used to electronic products having a 12 month warranty .
i believe the napster mp3 player has this feature .
first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .
picture this :
great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.
i 'd always eyed the nokia phones and had heard decent things about t-mobile , so i gave it a whirl .
i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models .
i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me .
i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .
do not underestimate this in your purchase decision .
no issues as of yet
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .
but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes .
it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up .
while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones .
size - bigger than the ipod
we got a 256mb card , and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend .
i 'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i 've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top , but that does n't stop me from loving this camera .
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !
with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;
one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched !
the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly
the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more .
synchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized .
the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle .
i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will .
here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of " plastic-like " ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .
8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy .
it is easy to " focus " in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .
these are minor problems , and i list them to save anyone else the trouble of discovering them .
well i decided to get this one .
huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .
dont let the bad reviews of the software change your mind .
it also covers over the power jack when closed .
operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .
i transfered all 16 gigs in 15 minutes without any errors via firewire .
and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control .
i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar .
great features .. .
it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into .
new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays .
manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
having 4000 or so mp3s , i never got more than 500 transfered .
progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) .
you 're talking totally different hardware .
the ipod 's white plastic look / surface does n't suit me .
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the " rigor " of a business traveler .
sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .
you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it .
i have had this dvd player for about 3 months now .
the radio :
does n't always register push-button movement .
it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds .
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .
but i would expect that , since my movie discs have all played with no problem , the extras discs would , too , without any additional tweaking .
for me , that was the only drawback .
had to cut out a window using a swiss army knife .
the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras .
actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated .
i do n't think so .
it looks great - and is loaded with features .
i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1.2 mb/per .
they play just about everything , but # 2 and # 3 died very shortly after getting them .
it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly .
i 've tried draining it until it wo n't turn on & recharging it overnight .
software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .
ipod can be used as an external disk , and apparently stores files without problem .
i changed video cables , tried connecting to tv on input1 and input2 but no help .
it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .
first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .
and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .
within months they stopped supporting the new mac os .
it happened to me once .
in addition , you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player .
well that was not a simple task .
you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .
the flap completely covers the screen because there is no window to see it .
touchups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct .
when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was .
however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .
the light goes from red to green but no display or any operation whatsoever .
the casing scratches a little easy , but the glove cases work great to protect against this .
so far not going to get a good review .
in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it .
i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out .
i can 't believe people continue to pay those prices .
i ordered 2 .
it would have been better to have some sort of window on teh carrying case , so you could see the display without opening it .
for `` cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does n't have any wow factor .
