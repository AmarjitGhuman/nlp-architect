I 'm told that it is open 24hrs which is good .
The food is outstanding and the service is quick , friendly and very professional .
Their eggplant is so delicate , sweet tender !
Mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a glass of wine ... but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff .
The atmosphere is n't the greatest , but I suppose that 's how they keep the prices down .
Our favorite meal is a pesto pizza , the house salad , and a good bottle of wine .
I actually gave Patroon another chance before writing this , but the second visit was even worse .
Sandwiches , burgers and salads , like the lemon-dressed cobb , are classic successes .
You ca n't say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown .
While the $ 20 entree range is not overly expensive , in New York City , there is definitely better food in that range , and so Sapphire , despite it 's lovely atmosphere , will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return .
A great choice at any cost and a great deal .
The wait staff is very courteous and accomodating .
The food is above average for midtown and sligtly better than some of the other Heartland Breweries in the city .
When you want a piece of beef , head on over .
I wish they had one near my office - I would go everyday .
But they do n't have a toaster , which is strange .
I had their eggs benedict for brunch , which were the worst in my entire life , I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was .
I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time .
I ca n't wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic patio .
I read about this place in Time Out magazine .
The service is ok , some of the people did n't get what they asked for .
The Deco and ambiance was really romantic .
Wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well !
If you do n't mind pre-sliced low quality fish , unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place .
You are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but : Cassuolet , Steake Fritte , Tripe Stew , etc ; simple stuff .
The space is limited so be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes - 1 hour , but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious indo-chinese food .
I asked for a simple medium rare steak .
overall , a solid restaurant and at less than $ 40pp ( including wine ) , a solid deal as well .
I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED !
P.S. Please do n't tell anyone in my family i eat there .
THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too -- but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area .
It 's not mind-blowing , but to me , thai food never is and never will be .
Would you ever believe that when you complain about over an hour wait , when they tell you it will be 20-30 minutes , the manager tells the bartender to spill the drinks you just paid for ?
Definately check it out !!!
The food arrived 20 minutes after I called , cold and soggy .
This place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city .
But after last night , Spice Grill is the only place I 'm eating indian cuisine .
I would go back .
The skillfully chosen Portuguese cheese cart paired with quality port provides the perfect Iberian ending .
We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves .
When you enter , you feel like you have entered your mom 's kitchen .
I loving bringing friends here - and I do so every chance I get .
We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there , sharing a large Pelligrino , a pizza of two of their specials , one was goat cheese the other blue cheese , and both were excellent .
Service and food is what any one would expect when spending that type of money .
This place is great .
Yes , the place is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while .
It 's a great place to pick up a cheap lunch or dinner .
my picks : Guizhou chicken , fish with hot bean source , fish fillet in spicy source ( special menu ) .
We ended the dinner with a surprisingly light and flaky apple tarte tatin .
Will give it another chance before I write it off .
When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not Mcdonald 's , every place makes things differently While it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude .
I live in the neightborhood and am a regular .
There 's something smooth about sipping sake upper east side style .
The lobster sandwich is $ 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price .
I 've waited over one hour for food .
I would definently recommend this restaurant .
I found it on a cold night , the perfect spot to warm up .
After 2 tries by the waiter to take it away ( we had n't even looked at it yet , we had full beers yet to drink ) , the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations .
Had 1 appetizer , 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the bill was ~ $ 55.00 , not including tip .
Check it out , it wo n't hurt your stomach or your wallet .
My husband said the portions were very small , but if my main course was good to eat the portion would 've been fine for me .
Highly recommend it !
The food is very good , but not outstanding .
While I quite liked the food and the ambience , I 'm not quite sure if it they really deserve it the Michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window .
WORST PLACE ON SMITH STREET IN BROOKLYN
I ca n't remember the last time I had such gross food in New York .
I felt as though I were eating in Paris .
I 've been to at Cafe Spice probably 5-8 times , it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square .
Haru on Park S is simply disgusting .
people are rude bit again it 's new york !
we love th pink pony .
In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food , this is one of the best spots .
We 've only eaten in the restaurant once , but we have ordered many times for dinner .
You can get a completely delish martini in a glass ( that 's about 2 1/2 drinks ) for $ 8.50 ( I recommend the Vanilla Shanty , mmmm ! ) in a great homey setting with great music .
Just make sure my ice water is kept full and my tea kettle filled with piping hot tea and that 's all the service I need ...
I have walked by this place for eons and finally went thanks to a girls ' night .
The characters really make for an enjoyable experience .
This is the kind of place you 'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret .
A guaranteeed delight !
BEST spicy tuna roll , great asian salad .
Service was very prompt but slightly rushed .
My bf and I go to the walk-up counter and order a pie .
All in all , the food was great ( except for the dessserts ) .
From the erbazzone emiliana to the mostarda on the cheese plate , the dishes at this restaurant are all handled with delicate care .
Overall , the ingredients and technique are there and I am encouraged enough to return at lunch or dinner to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves .
The secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered .
It does n't look appetizing as it 's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black , but the taste was phenomenal .
Place should also have a 1,2,3 chili rating to be more authentic ...
Oh , but wait , we were out of drinks ( which were also delightfully overpriced ) .
being a fan of spicy ethnic foods , indian included , i made friends with this place long ago .
I am bringing my whole family back next time .
This was on a Tuesday night .
Great Indian Food !
Great place , great value .
I read the other review and have to say I had the opposite experience here last Sunday .
My friends spoke so much about it for months , I finally made the time to come down ear and dine in .
The crowd was older and the restaurant is very cramped , but it has old school charm .
Was n't going to share but I feel obligated ... while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing .
But $ 1 for each small piece ???
Well , this place is so Ghetto its not even funny .
While this can hardly be called a restaurant , it is possibly the best deal in Manhatten : $ 4 for a plate heaped with rice and 2-3 entrees .
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere .
I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read .
this is can became on e of the NY Italian Food fare institutions .
great hot dogs . .
but their mac cheese was YUMMY !
My goodness , everything from the fish to the rice to the seaweed was absolutely amazing .
The service is excellent , the decor is great , and the food is delicious and comes in large portions .
I highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try .
Also , I personally was n't a fan of the portobello and asparagus mole .
They are by far the BEST past in New York .
My girlfriend and I just spent our 10 month anniversary at Lou Lou .
The pasta primavera was outstanding as well , lots of fresh veggies .
The staff there is very attentive and down to earth .
Try the Pad Thai , it 's fabulous and their prices are so cheap !
The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent .
great eats , good times .
For desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse ( interesting but not extraordinary ) and matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal .
Wish NY had more of these kind of places : intimate , superb food , homey , top notch all the way around , certainly worth the wait .
His response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening .
They smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone .
I recieved prompt service with a smile .
Even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine , if you can call $ 70.00 inexpensive , the cost is through the roof for better than average fare .
He offers subpar service and has no personality .
A quintessential slice of NYC pizza .
Unbelievable .
delicious .
My favs here are the Tacos Pastor and the Tostada de Tinga ...
The space kind of feels like an Alice in Wonderland setting , without it trying to be that .
Their sake list was extensive , but we were looking for Purple Haze , which was n't listed but made for us upon request !
$ 6 and there is much tasty food , all of it fresh and continually refilled .
Otherwise , this place has great service and prices and a nice friendly atmosphere .
Have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience .
You 'll adore it .
This place was not ALL THAT !
I have never been so disgusted by both food an service .
I also ordered the Change Mojito , which was out of this world .
oh speaking of bathroom , the mens bathroom was disgusting .
The bar drinks were Eh , ok to say the least .
I though it was expensive and I prefer Bella Via just blocks away by far .
Check this place out !
MMmmm ... it was delicious .
I care more about the food and ambience .
Get it together .
In fact there is only one I 've tried that even compares ( shabu Tatsu ) and even then I prefer Dokebi .
i know , you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored , but my agenda is i 'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends , seeking a pleasant experience .
I have been going there since it opened and I ca n't get enough .
Everyone is welcomed in as family .
If you like the food and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants , this is not the place for you .
I pray it stays open forever .
Service was also very good .
I am so coming back here again , as much as I can .
Went on a 3 day oyster binge , with Fish bringing up the closing , and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended , because it was so great !
A little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite .
The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great indian appetizers .
If you like Sakagura but you feel it 's too much , you 'd better try Yokocho .
After all that , they complained to me about the small tip .
As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited .
The food was just OK , at least for what food was available .
Well worth the trip , close to City Hall and downtown subway stops .
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose .
Way below average
I was pleasantly suprised .
If you are a vegetarian , this really is n't a good place to go .
On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch .
Casablanca servces delicious falafel , tabouleh , humus and other Mediterranean delights , which are all very inexpensive .
No desert menu , no apology , nothing !!!!!!
I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks !
My husband said he could 've eaten several more , the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had .
There are a few Italian employees who may not speak the best English but for me that adds to the experience .
The food is reliable and the price is moderate .
The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive .
I HAVE NEVER HAD A BAD MEAL ( OR BAD SERVICE ) @ PIGALLE .
Not worth the prices .
the food is delicious and highly recommended .
This place is classy , chic , the service is warm and hospitable , and the food is outstanding .
The food at this place is ' gourmet ' Indian cuisine .
Other guests enjoyed pizza , santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips .
Before the place did n't call my attention .
The bagels always warm , soft on the inside , crispy on the outside and enormous in size .
Curioni 's Pizza has been around since the 1920 's .
Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm , but the open kitchen is part of the charm .
This place is not worth the prices .
I stopped by for some brunch today and had the vegan cranberry pancakes and some rice milk .
The food they serve is not comforting , not appetizing and uncooked .
I have to agree with the previous reviewer .
Anyways , if you 're in the neighborhood to eat good food , I would n't waste my time trying to find something , rather go across the street to Tamari .
I must say it 's a little pricey for the food because it was not as spectacular as the view .
The Thai food is good .
However , go for the ambience , and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world !
Check out the secret back room .
I came to fresh expecting a great meal , and all I got was marginally so-so food served in a restaurant that was just so freezing we could n't enjoy eating .
but the service was a bit slow .
The location and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it .
bad staff
It 's eaten with black vinegar and shredded ginger .
Get the tuna of gari .
They were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior .
Go for the Seafood Paella for two .
It may be a bit packed on weekends , but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area .
The staff is very attentive and we can almost always get a table .
Anyhow , we were able to sit as long as we wanted and chat , which was nice .
The food was very well prepared .
Unbelievable .
I am not the most experienced person when it comes to Thai food , but my friend who took me there is .
They have an excellent selection ( the rolls with crab are really great ) .
Not what I wanted to hear .
The crispy chicken was n't for us , though .
It 's usually packed for good reason , esp .
For all you lazy folks that do n't want to come to Alphabet City , I say , good - stay out .
Too bad , has a lot of potential .
Definitely not a restaurant to skip !
To be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora .
Only complaint would be that at an average cost of $ 12 - $ 15 per meal , I 'd like not to have to worry about finding a seat !
I have enjoyed everything I have ever gotten and the fish is so fresh and always prepared in a great way .
Plain and simple it 's bad thai food .
Food is excellent .
The noise level was unbearable , conversation impossible .
A great choice at any cost and a great deal .
Also very inexpensive .
Mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila .
They brought glasses and the bottle , and just left the bottle at our table .
The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates .
So my husband made up an excuse so we can leave .
Too bad the food was n't of the same heritage .
It 's just O.K. pizza .
I CAN EAT HERE EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK REALLY LOL LOVE THIS PLACE ... )
Finally let into the store 5 at a time , to buy expensive slices from a harried staff .
With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored .
you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review .
Nha Trang , while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor , horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals , is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i 've ever been to . the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables .
The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual .
The eggplant parmesan is also great , and my friend who grew up in Manhattan claims that no one serves a better baked ziti with meatsauce .
The mussaman curry that I ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that I ordered in it , they graciously provided me with ONE piece of poorly cooked potato .
Read all the other review , they 'll confirm it .
You ca n't go wrong with this place .
I pray it stays open forever .
This is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and I can not comp it .
This is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates .
Went with mommy ( the only person who could afford taking me here ) .
Loved It
It 's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone .
Finally , I got sick of the bad service , obnoxious smirks , and snotty back talk .
It 's a nice place to relax and have conversation .
Rao 's has the best service and atmosphere in NYC .
On a recent Sunday afternoon , a friend and I accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT .
My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge !
So for a filling and healthy meal give it a go .
The pizza was pretty good and huge .
While it 's not Nobu , it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full .
Truly the mark of an attentive waiter .
this is still one of my most favorite restaurants in the area the food is inexpensive but very good ( kimono shrimp special was excellent ) and has a great atmosphere .
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta ( raddichio was kind of bitter though ) .
The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty .
I highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try .
Beef noodle soup is good as well .
Less = More in their case .
And $ 11 for a plate of bland guacamole ?
Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
Even though I made the reservation at 3pm for the same night through Dinnerbroker , we were seated at a table with one of the best view !
Over the years , it has always provided a pleasurable dining experience with quality food and wine .
It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine .
Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon , Sea Bass and Crispy Duck .
Shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here : simple contract , deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20 .
The service was very attentive and very generous .
It was wonderful .
We called the other person who was very close by , and she told us to order for her , so we did .
Try the Peanut Butter Sorbet and the pizza with soy cheese !
After so many great reviews here , my bf and I went to Esca to celebrate my birthday last nite .
I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken .
Thanks Bloom 's for a lovely trip .
Enjoy !!!
Pick a bagel has the best bagels in the city .
If you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained , this is a great place to go and eat .
the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality .
Also , the sandwiches ( nearing $ 7 ) did n't come with anything like chips or a side .
The waitress remembers me and is very friendly , she knows what my regular is and that 's the fried mini buns with the condensed milk and the assorted fruits on beancurd .
The dessert ( we had a pear torte ) was good - but , once again , the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions .
go here for the drinks !
The ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal , but some dishes are quite good , such as the eggplant parmesan , veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca .
We visited Bread Bar during January restaurant week and were so pleased with the menu selections and service .
THEY HAVE WAITERS ON THE SIDEWALK TRYING TO PULL YOU IN WHICH MADE US SUSPICIOUS .
The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
By far , the best pizza in Manhattan .
The fish was adequate , but inexpertly sliced .
I am amazed by the poor reviews - I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian - great prices , great atmosphere , good service and a wonderful wine list .
This time , I prefer not to go into detail .
Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed , however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance .
The crust is thin , the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly .
Not only is the service great , but forming conversation around a table is so easy beacuse the atmosphere can be both romantic and comfortable .
We spent $ 200 in this place and left hungry and very disappointed .
Not only is the cuisine the best around , the service has always been attentive and charming .
The wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for Chinatown ) alternative .
Quartino is my favoriate resturant in NYC .
Seating is always prompt , though the restaurant does fill up in the evening .
We were offered water for the table but were not told the Voss bottles of water were $ 8 a piece .
No , really .
Nothing fancy but really good food with pretty reasonable price .
The large selection of bruschettas , paninis , tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating .
The svc can be a bit rude at times , esp if you have big group , but overall the restaurant is a must !
When we threatened to leave , we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing .
I ate clams oreganta and spectacular salad with perfectly marinated cucumbers and tomatoes with lots of shrimp and basil .
Three strikes and this restaurant is out .
The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing !
I 'll be back for sure .
I have been to Rao 's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better .
The food is great and the milkshakes are even better !
The halibut cheek appetizer came with a generous portion of foie gras , but that 's about the only positive thing I can say about the meal .
The bartenders and the managers are really nice and the decor is very comfy and laid-back , all the while being trendy .
I was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter .
No one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our plates .
Need I say more ?
( La Rosa is connected by a swinging door to the Mexican restaurant Pacifico ) .
Service was awful - mostly because staff were overwhelmed on a Saturday night .
They have a very diverse menu so its something for everybody .
This place is a literal hole-in-the-wall that is buried within Doyers , right off of Pell St ( barber 's alley ) in Chinatown .
Service is not exactly five star , but thats not really a big deal .
Moules were excellent , lobster ravioli was VERY salty !
Dahkin also offers prix fixe lunch and buffet .
i actually feel like i should keep it a secret .
This is the perfect date spot for Williamsburg couples .
Authentic Korean food lovers should visit 32nd Street , of course .
I 've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences .
The production is a symphony , alot of fun to experience.The food sublime for the most part .
But the service is HORRID !
during happy hour !
The decor is really blah , and not at all hip or happening .
Will absolutely visit again .
The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices .
Dessert was also to die for !
The place is a BISTRO which means : simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere .
Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet .
Just because it 's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty , IT IS GREAT !
The help was extremely nice and did not rush us .
Never again !
This place has many different styles of pizza and they are all amazing .
However , service was as plain as sesame crusted Salmon I had .
The staff has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often .
Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you .
It is very overpriced and not very tasty .
You ca n't go wrong here .
I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date .
Most of the servers are very attentive , friendly and quite attractive .
Good spreads , great beverage selections and bagels really tasty .
Try the homemade breads .
I have known about this secret for the last 13 years , Emilio ( the Godfather ) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices .
The restaurant is dark and not very attractive and then you have spot lights shining on you putting you in the worst light possible , reaching for sunglasses .
Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table .
I came across Village Underground by accident , now I go there all the time .
they did n't disappoint , service from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table .
IT is the best deal in town for a Monday night dinner at a fine restaurant .
I have been going there since it opened and I ca n't get enough .
My six year old loved it .
The atmosphere is n't the greatest , but I suppose that 's how they keep the prices down .
You can not go wrong at the Red Eye Grill .
The food was good too .
Drawbacks : service is slow and they do n't toast !
However , our $ 14 drinks were were horrible !
She replied " well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now , since you are a larger party , and it might get crowded . "
I just had my first visit to this place and ca n't wait to go back and slowly work my way through the menu .
And cheap !
I 'm not even going to bother to describe it ; it speaks for itself .
The sake ’s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world .
I recommend any of their salmon dishes ......
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .
Also , do n't plan on asking for your favorite roll , if it 's not on the menu , you ca n't have it .
Good food .
Do n't be fooled by crowds of people .
Jimmy is Dominican !
Worth it for a special occasion , or any time !
Had a great meal there this weekend before heading to the movies !
Unfortunately , with our show tickets , we did n't have time to sample any desserts .
Next time , we would n't dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks .
This is the perfect spot for meeting friends , having lunch , dinner , pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks !
I have to say that I am pleasantly suprised and I will most likely stop in again if I am in the neighborhood .
The place was real empty but that was because this was the first Sunday they ever opened .
Oh , and there 's hookah .
Overall , this is a great new restaurant that has been consistently good every time I have been .
We ordered a glass of wine and were finished eating and paying before the wine came .
Yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken .
While the ambiance and atmosphere were great , the food and service could have been a lot better .
This place is average ... at best .
Chennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city .
INCREDIBLY POOR SERVICE AN FOOD QUALITY AT EXORBITANT PRICES .
Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff .
Average to good Thai food , but terrible delivery .
We will definitely go back .
As a long-time patron of Mamoun 's , I always figured that I had found the best late night food spot in the city .
Whenever you need a Sushi fix , Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service .
This place is worth going even if only for their beer .
if your into thai . . you can not miss this great restaurant .
Really nice restaurant to go with a group or on a date .
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect , which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me , i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water , or the check .
You can even get packages of the chutneys to stock your fridge !
IT WAS OUR ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT AND WANTED AN AUTHENTIC ITALIAN MEAL .
The table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long overdue bottle of wine finally arrived .
The dishes offered were unique , very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages , sardines with biscuits , large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream ( the best and freshest I 've ever had ) .
Drinks got screwed up , she acted put upon .
The food is amazing , rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza .
Oh right , I should probably say something nice .
( that is A MUST , but not every restaurant can do ... )
My boyfriend and I recently had an early dinner at Artisanal and was satisfied with our experience .
Bukhara is on my top 5 Indian places in NYC
I went with JWILS .
A gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order .
They never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table .
head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st , taj mahal is also very comparable , in food quality , to the much overpraised ( and underdeserving ) baluchi 's .
The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary .
I liked the food at this quasi-thai restaurant .
The pizza was pretty good and huge .
Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you , but the food does n't quite match up .
For the price , you can not eat this well in Manhattan .
I was glad I did .
None of that yucky whipped stuff .
Simple comfort food and what hot and lage portions .
wow ! how have i missed this one , tried Long Tan last week for the first time and now know what the NY TIMES and many more in the neighborhood already knew .
We went there , no one greeted us .
The last time I went we were seated at a table in a corridor next to the kitchen .
The service is fine and they allow you to enjoy the view .
This is definitely a place that provides the best experience , though , to both A-listers and people walking in off the street .
The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well .
If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this place .
What more can you ask for ?
This is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed .
This is some really good , inexpensive sushi .
We always get a sampling of appetizers and share .
If we were to move from the upper east side , we would genuinely miss this restaurant .
You can not go wrong with this place .
We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great !
I am bringing my whole family back next time .
During the course of the past 3 months , the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better .
The sandwiches are dry , tasteless and way overpriced .
Too bad Latin Quarters closed .
However , there is just something so great about being outdoors , in great landscaping , enjoying a casual drink that makes going to this place worthwhile .
It was pretty inexpensive too .
But that is highly forgivable .
We ended up having to just leave because we were essentially being ignored by the wait staff -- even though the rest of the restaurant was largely empty .
We thought this a prelude to what the evening will be like .
The lack of AC and the fact that there are a million swarming bodies ( although everyone is polite and no one is pushing ) is a slight turn off .
Check out the secret back room .
Service is top notch .
Great roofdeck , nice group of 30 somethings , but no music , kind of quiet .
I recommend this place to everyone .
We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night .
Great wine list and great cocktail menu .
night without a reservation , we had to wait at the bar for a little while , but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience .
Be sure not to get anything other than bagels ! . .
If you are looking for a good quality , cheap eats - this is the place .
We were fans of the half-price Saturday night option until some inedible squid during a recent visit .
It is run by the same Sichuan chef who started the chain in Chinatown .
The atmosphere is unheralded , the service impecible , and the food magnificant .
The sushi is also great !
However , go for the ambience , and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world !
Quality of food is excellent and price is cheap , stick to pork , fish , chicken , lamb and vegetables .
The only thing more wonderful than the food ( which is exceptional ) is the service .
My daughter 's wedding reception at Water 's Edge received the highest compliments from our guests .
SEA has become so popular that they 've let it go to their heads .
Much more reasonably priced too !
Ummm ... the beer was cold .
I just do not understand what the fuss is all about .
Pizza is terrific , as is homemade pasta .
I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork .
Price no more than a Jersey deli but way better .
The atmosphere is warm , comfortable , artsy and sexy .
Not much of a selection of bottled beer either , we went with Brahma .
Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top .
Bring your date and a bottle of wine !
I look forward to eating here again
The food was not fresh , the sauces were bland and very oily .
Yakitori ( bbq meats ) is tasty too .
Odd for Ave B , not just odd , The place attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least .
While this is n't classical restaurant fare , the chef has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely Indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burn-outs .
The setting is casual and romantic .
Not to be overlooked , the service is excellent .
The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that .
I do n't think I would go again .
In fact , it appears he is going to go postal at any moment .
great for a romantic evening , or a fun evening with friends ...
But dinner here is never disappointing , even if the prices are a bit over the top .
The staff is no nonsense .
I live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of The Pizza Place at 3am .
Good for dates or with friends .
Fabulous food - if the front of house staff do n't put you off –
-- Eat Club is a roving group of NYC gluttons
If you 're looking for a place to sit down , have a drink and conversations with friends , go to sweet-n-tart and order yourself a hong-kong styled milk and tea with tapioca pearls ( hot ) .
OK , I 've been to Dumont a few times now .
I have to say I have never had a disapointing meal here .
The waitress suggested glasses of wine that went very well with the food .
It was wonderful .
Prices are in line .
During the course of the past 3 months , the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better .
Food portion was SMALL and below average .
Our server was very helpful and friendly .
I complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted .
and i have been around the block , to say the very least .
They are extremely rude , not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $ 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread !
Everyone treats you like you were part of the family .
We were looking forward to nice glass of Sangria when we arrived .
) It 's not the best Japanese restaurant in the East Village , but it 's a pretty solid one for its modest prices , and worth repeat visits .
As a Japanese native , I 've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years , but I was just so amazed at this place .
What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka . . some of which we never received !
I paid just about $ 60 for a good meal , though : )
even the wine by the glass was good .
Make sure you try this place as often as you can .
Good for casual dinner with jeans and sneakers .
At $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you 're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture .
The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date .
As a fan of Thai , I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst .
There is " Expensive-but-worth-it " and there is " Expensive-and-WTF " ?
wont come back again for sure !
Obviously run by folks who know a pie .
Went on a 3 day oyster binge , with Fish bringing up the closing , and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended , because it was so great !
Good luck getting a table .
The service was typical short-order , dinner type .
Overall , not worth the money .
No you 're going to go back because the food was good .
The food always tastes fresh and served promptly .
The place is a little tight and on a cold day , the seating by the entranceway can be pretty drafty .
One of my favorite places in Manhattan .
I was looking for banana tempura for dessert and they dont have .
I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends , and spent three enjoyable hours there .
For the price you pay for the food here , you 'd expect it to be at least on par with other Japanese restaurants .
Not a large place , but it 's cute and cozy .
Watch the talented belly dancers as you enjoy delicious baba ganoush that 's more lemony than smoky .
in conclusion , THIS PLACE SUCKS !!!
sandwiches tho pricey are over stuffed - can serve 2 persons easily thus cost effective !
This particular location certainly uses substandard meats .
I 've been to this monster sushi twice , the 46th st once , the 23rd st one a number of times .
The strong scents coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds .
You must try Odessa stew or Rabbit stew ; salads-all good ; and kompot is soo refreshing during the hot summer day ( they make it the way my mom does , reminds me of home a lot ) .
I love Indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it .
The service is a quite slow , but friendly .
The staff is courteous and friendly .
They showed up 15 minutes after the tuna melt .
I know because I live nearby .
we decided to eat in tea room which was small and cute .
The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger , to steak , to escargot .
Delicate spices , onions , eggs and a kick-ass roti .
All in all a wonderful experience , ca n't wait to come back .
Ask for Usha , the nicest bartender in manhattan .
Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $ 10 .
After I paid for my purchase , I noticed they had not given me utensils so I could eat my pie .
The chicken pot pie is excpetiona , the cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm .
Go inside and you wo n't want to leave .
I found the food to be just as good as its owner , Da Silvano , just much less expensive .
We had our Christmas party at Dos Caminos and it was wonderful .
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta ( raddichio was kind of bitter though ) .
The service is a bit slow , but harkens back to my years growing up in Napoli , Italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night .
Do n't expect to sit down inside though , there are only a few tables and they are always full .
I ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime .
The food is wonderful , tasty and filling , and the service is professional and friendly .
We did n't even see a menu , as our waiter described both the specials and the main dishes .
Despite a slightly limited menu , everything prepared is done to perfection , ultra fresh and a work of food art .
They are FAST .
Went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and appetizers .
I 've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times , but more often I order delivery .
Moving on .
It 's all about the food !!
I ordered tamarind duck and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef , and we were both delighted by the way the dishes evoked Thai flavors in unexpected ways .
If you live in Upper Manhattan , Siam Square is THE place for Thia food .
I have been going to this restaurant for years , in the past the service was average and the food inconsistant .
Went inside and I started to get excited .
I went here with a friend on a whim , we went someplace else first and could n't get a table .
Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most .
and never strayed .
Try ordering from the regular menu , then you would not regret !
The waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal !
I could have drank 4 glasses of water and still been parched - so watch out .
Buon appetito !
It was a very nice surprise .
We had Pam 's special fried fish and it was amazing .
The hostess said " Wow that 's a large group , unless you are n't together " , to which I replied " no we are , and there will be one more , so a table for six please . "
I 've eaten at all three locations and I always love , love the food , the service is always wonderful and the prices are really reasonable .
A wonderful place !
Love their drink menu .
I have been twice to this restaurant .
Always a nice crowd , but never loud .
Would NEVER go back there .
They are located in the middle of Chinatown !
If celebrities make you sweat , then your in for a ride , but if your like most around these parts then you 'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype .
Terrible Waste of money . . scammers
Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit , but the food was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues .
No gimmicks here -- the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation .
I always find myself sitting next to someone in the theatre industry - interesting to hear ideas hashed out while having a quick bite to eat .
All of the apetizers are good and the Sangria is very good .
The aesthetics of this place are like an airport lounge .
The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .
LOL
I can not imagine better Indian food in all of the city .
My friends and I were on vacation in NY and was referred to Chance by a friend .
Perhaps the last reviewer ( who stated she was treated with attitude ) lives in a parallel universe because I have never had anything but a perfect experience at Yasuda .
There 's nice and quiet , small but enough for 6 ( or more ) .
The bread was stale , the salad was overpriced and empty .
SUM IT : local investment bankers like it , try for yourself at least once .
The banana tower is an amazing dessert as well .
Great neighborhood joint .
I often find myself with time to kill in Times Square , which is a shame since I do n't love this area .
I work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time .
We usually just get some of the dinner specials and they are very reasonably priced and very tasty .
The large selection of bruschettas , paninis , tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating .
From the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the place was packed .
We arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly .
When you 're sitting in their main dining room ( which has a spectacular , hand-painted high ceiling ) you 'd never know there was a world outside .
They 're rude at times , and not very friendly .
Stick to the items the place does best , brisket , ribs , wings , cajun shrimp is good , not great .
This is the first time Citysearch did ' t call it right .
They have some great entrees here as well .
This is a great Thai restaurant with a very friendly staff .
My turkey burger was not cooked at all , my friends salmon was completely raw .
I would highly recommend .
What you are paying for is the environment and the name .
There was a small wait , but shorter than I expected .
If you do n't mind all that noise then go to the Chart House .
Oh , and the complimentary pudding dessert was just enough - yummy !
The entree was bland and small , dessert was not inspired .
An excellent service
Desserts are almost incredible : my personal favorite is their Tart of the Day .
What a great place !
The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese ( gets a little messy ) .
The prices are not terrible .
The people with carts of food do n't understand you because they do n't speak English , their job is to give you the delicious food you point at .
I 'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food .
An unpretentious spot in Park Slope , the sushi is consistently good , the service is pleasant , effective and unassuming .
but when we looked at the menu , there were n't a lot of choices , most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section .
The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine ( which cost less than the food ) , and made it seem like a big concession .
I generally like this place .
We went to this restaurant based on prior internet comments .
Ruth , mother of the Bride
The combination of super-fresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious .
Despite the 5th ave address there are no frills whick I also love .
The well mannered , pleasant staff that Tony has in his employ .
My chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin .
A pleasant surprise .
The ground chickpea soup we sampled as a starter tasted somewhat thin .
Service - friendly and attentive .
Great bagels made the old-fashioned way .
The wait staff was loud and inconsiderate .
This place is a great bargain .
the real kicker of the menu , however , is the beef cubes or the chicken with chili and lemon grass .
It can not be the ambience , because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle .
I would highly recommend .
All in all , this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city .
The food was not very tasty , the portioins were tiny even for such a high quality restaurant .
fine dining restaurant quality .
I have never eaten in the restaurant , however , upon reading the reviews I got take out last week .
The spicy mussels are a highlight .
My friends and I stop here for pizza before hitting the Kips Bay movie theater .
for out-of-towners who will get a big thrill out of the location !
What can you say about a place where the waitress brings out the wrong entree , then verbally assaults your 80 year old grandmother and gives her lip about sending it back ( which she did politely , by the way ) .
Never fails to please .
We had a wonderful meal at Naples 45 a month ago on a visit to NYC .
They have homemade pastas of all kinds -- I recommend the gnocchi -- yum !
Having moved I truly miss this place .
always fresh and delicious .
It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips .
This place is always packed .
We were seated next to a couple whose kitchen was being renovated and we agreed since we 're all foodies who eat out a lot - that this was n't a place we 'd return to .
The pickles were great addition .
I will definetly be going back .
There was no ambiance .
The Yellowtail was particularly good as well .
My sister says it reminds her of a restaurant run by high-school students who do n't know what they are doing .
I recommend the garlic shrimp , okra ( bindi ) , and anything with lamb .
The drinks are great , especially when made by Raymond .
The staff are attentive , and have smiles on their faces .
The food is delicious .
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian .
The whole experience was satisfying .
Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights .
Even when the chef is not in the house , the food and service are right on target .
I could n't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach .
I 'm saving up for my next visit .
Not enough wines by the glass either .
It 's just average , just shredded , no seasoning on it .
The sushi was awful !
Not the greatest sushi place , but excellent for a $ 19.95 all you can eat .
A one women show !
I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors .
What more could you want ?
Also , the sandwiches ( nearing $ 7 ) did n't come with anything like chips or a side .
The fajita we tried was tasteless and burned and the mole sauce was way too sweet .
As a fan of Thai , I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst .
The cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee !!
Terrible , terrible management - deserves to be shut-down .
The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned .
I asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if I like Uni . (
The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree .
There 's candlelight and music .
Even better , they know how to cook French classics like Steak au Poivre and Onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it .
Try the mediterranean salad , it is a true experience for your taste buds !!
They have it all -- great price , food , and service .
My boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent .
Good , because hey , it 's more food , but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap .
The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had ( I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat ) .
Just bring someone who speaks Cantonese because waiter may not understand you .
I need at least three rolls to be full , and that 's at least $ 14.00 !
My husbands was perfect , my was well done and dry .
but for the value , it was a great affordable spot to enjoy a fun night out with small group .
I highly recommend it .
This made it obvious that the food was n't cooked fresh ; it was obviously made before hand and then reheated .
I 'm telling you ...
And I would have to agree with the masses in terms of service - delivery is their Achilles ' heel .
good place to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic french dish over a glass of wine .
The staff is unbelievably friendly , and I dream about their Saag gosht ... so good .
Service is highly refined : our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress .
i know , you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored , but my agenda is i 'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends , seeking a pleasant experience .
We picked it randomly , without a recommendation from someone who has been there , so we were n't sure what to expect .
The fried rice is amazing here .
From the street it looks very hidden , and is actually an old warehouse .
Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn .
Obviously the Chinese translation of this place does not mean Big Wong , it actually means Great Prosperity .
perfect for a quick meal .
I look forward to eating here again
The selection of food is excellent ( I 'm not used to having much choice at restaurants ) , and the atmosphere is great .
Chef Waldy 's always measures up .
When we inquired about ports - the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost .
You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert .
My wife had barely touched that mess of a dish .
What a great place .
The lobster sandwich is $ 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price .
I would have gotten some cole slaw and a knish if my stomach had more space .
We a menu that rearely changes , e xcept for one or two specials , the quality and care they put in thier food in evident .
While the food was good ( certainly no Il Mulino ) the service was horrendous .
it was really good pizza .
We were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry .
Probably would not go again ...
Highly recommended ... As stated , I have n't dined * in * the restaurant but stopped by there to pick up takeout and it seems a very relaxing place ; also , the bar looks nice .
I 've been to Joya twice and I will never go again .
However , it is jus too good to not praise it .
We ordered a tuna melt - it came with out cheese which just made it a tuna sandwich .
This is one of the best comfort food places in the city .
Sweet Irish bartender is always happy and able to bring a smile to my friends a my face .
Nothing special about this place .
The rolls are creative and I have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious japanese food .
To the owners ; good job guys , this place is a keeper !
The food is okay and the prices here are mediocre .
It 's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre food , noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks .
A Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner ?
Lexicographers take note : a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn .
El Nidos one of the best restaurants in New York which I 've ever been to , has a great variety of tasty , mouth watering pizza 's .
From the moment you enter till the moment you walk out the friendly and helpful staff was was just Fantastic .
The red curry is weak and tasteless , the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy , the rice is often overcooked , and the seafood is pretty sketchy .
The food was authentic .
The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees .
Sake collection was excellent ( Try Nanbu Bijin ) , but pricy .
Cornelia Street looks like a Broadway set for West Side Story and the inside of Po is so cool quaint you really ca n't top the setting for a romantic dinner in NYC .
I have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .
I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said , " can I help you " and " how many are in your party . "
I work near-by , and they have the BEST oatmeal in the neighborhood - not a packaged or quick-cooked item .
I have been to Roth 's twice and both times were very disappointing .
A great place to meet up for some food and drinks ...
I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .
While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance , and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City , the food was not what I had hoped for .
The food is great and reasonably priced .
Wow over 100 beers to choose from .
We had a 3 hour brunch - they definitely do not rush you - and they kept the unlimited mimosas flowing the whole time .
The food is reliable and the price is moderate .
We could only get through an appetizer and cheese fondue .
But after last night , Spice Grill is the only place I 'm eating indian cuisine .
The staff should be a bit more friendly .
However , I think this place is a good hang out spot .
fine dining restaurant quality .
Even with John 's and Joe 's around the corner , this place will make a name for itself .
For asian fusion , there are many places further downtown .
What a difference , the service was very comforting and the food was better than average , but what really standed out was such a dynamic and extensive beer list .
Go here .
This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant , the food .
The food was just awful , ATROCIOUS actually .
Oh yeah ever on the west side try there sister resturant Arties Cafe .
I am so coming back here again , as much as I can .
A beautifully designed dreamy Egyptian restaurant that gets sceney at night .
I recommend the jelly fish , drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings , certainly the stir fry blue crab .
The place 's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh .
However , in the summer of 2003 , it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup .
amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages PLEASE do yourself a favor and check this place out !!!!
Try their chef 's specials -- they are to die for .
Anyone who ever dined at a thai restaurant is in for a huge disappointment .
The food is also outstanding and is served quite quickly .
The menu looked good , except for offering the Chilean Sea Bass , but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside .
Worth the trip from Manhattan .
Our first time in New York and we had to try a New York Bagel .
By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant .
I thought going to Jimmys would give me a real Domincan exprience .
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty ( could 've used a bit more salt ) .
We got most of it back at home with us .
Still , try it once , since if you end up loving the food , it could be one of your best dining experiences .
We try frequenting new restaurants all over the city , but any time that we visit a restaurant other than Roth 's we are always disappointed .
Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey .
Others have to go to other restaurants and feel sad until they 're eaten .
I 've dined at Alain Ducasse 's restaurant in Monte Carlo for half the price for the same excellent dining experience .
The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you do n't like .
Loved it !
Food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience ) .
I 've been to Sotto Voce several time , and I have to say this one place that hits the nail right on the head ever time !
Actually , everyone who worked there seemed to be annoyed .
Took my mom for Mother 's Day , and the maitre d' was pretty rude .
This tiny Williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising .
The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that .
There are no negatives to speak of .
It is kinda nosiy and the tables are close together but it 's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner .
Will give it another chance before I write it off .
The wait staff was very attentive and polite .
For a savory take on the soup and sandwich meal , try the hot and sour soup .
it 's good but , like the movie is never as good as the book , this is same analogy .
The atmosphere is unheralded , the service impecible , and the food magnificant .
Once you step into Cosette , you 're miraculously in a small , off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro .
I 'll be back soon .
The fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef ( usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt ) .
it is a cozy place to go with a couple of friends .
Regardless , we 'll be back and ca n't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio .
We had a birthday party here recently and the food and service was amazing .
The menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked .
The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese was n't even fully melted !
And Kruno , the beverage manager is the best bartender I have yet to come across .
If you are a Tequila fan you will not be disappointed .
The service is pretty good .
One of my favorites though was the Angry Lobster , a cold lobster salad that was magnificent .
You can do it here .
like saying her bread comes from a special bakery when we have seen her buying it dowtown manhathan .
When it came time to take the order the waiter gave us a hard time , walked away then came back with a paper and pen for us to write down what we wanted ... excuse me but is n't that his job ???
The atmosphere was nice but it was a little too dark .
I would recommend Roxy 's for that , but not for their food .
Do n't go .
Highly recommend this as great value for excellent sushi and service .
Most people eat there seem to be typical Upper East Side snobs , so be aware .
Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away .
. the best I 've found outside of the Chinatown masters .
Surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as Kobe .
i had a delicious shrimp creole .
We ate out in the back patio , which is worth it as it 's cool and the music is hear well there .
I came again weeks later with my boyfriend and again had a very nice experience .
For $ 600 ( the most we have ever paid ) not even waving a magic wand will ever get us back for a repeat performance .
I wish I lived there as I would eat at this place as often as possible !
And at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the check was given to our table by knocking over a glass of water .
Immediately after we paid , the waiter took the money and said , okay , you guys are outta here .
This restaurant was way overhyped .
I love this cozy around the way Rest .
Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order .
I ca n't believe people complain about no cheese sticks ?
Very good service and very good prices .
Patsy 's Pizza = true love
THE FOOD PORTIONS ARE REALLY LARGE .
I had their eggs benedict for brunch , which were the worst in my entire life , I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was .
The first 2 courses were very good , but the chocolate sampler was too rich for me and the dessert wine far too sweet .
I live a block away and go to Patsy 's frequently .
I love this place more and more everytime i go .
Get the tuna of gari .
We were sorry to check them off our list as we had enjoyed and recommended the place in the past .
Each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface , and you get platters of thin sliced meats , various vegetables , and rice and glass noodles .
Also , specify if you like your food spicy - its rather bland if you do n't .
I recommend the black roasted codfish , it was the best dish of the evening .
For all of you new to Indian food , try the Paneer Roll , it is a piece of heaven .
Good , fast service .
Go to Volare for 1st class service and terrific food .
Ambiance is barely romantic but management tries .
Because we did n't have a reservation , we could only sit in the back garden , but it was great , secluded and perfect in nice weather .
Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh , a delicious and sweet tasting bread .
Food is great and inexpensive .
If you go here , do it on his off-night .
It 's about $ 7 for lunch and they have take-out or dine-in .
Then they somehow made a dry and burnt crust , around a raw and cold inside .
It 's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we 've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years .
The level of rudeness was preposterous .
The wine the service was very good too .
It 's one of our favorite places to eat in NY .
Good drink .
Toons has recently been redone , so it 's now a very attractive space .
The food was excellent - authentic Italian cuisine made absolutely fresh .
Decor is charming .
Okay-i do n't mind the oily part ( cause most are cooked that way ) but it was way too bland .
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date .
We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it .
Rude service , medicore food ... there are tons of restaurants in NY ... stay away from this one
It is thick and slightly soggy .
I 've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious .
Definitely not worth the price !
If you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo .
We were very pleasantly surprised .
I know because I live nearby .
A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning !
Their calzones are horrific , bad , vomit-inducing , YUCK .
Little Tonino 's is just awesome , our favorite delivery place in Kennsington , honestly the best Gnochi I have ever had !
Only drawback - they wo n't toast your bagel , and they do n't make eggs for the bagel .
Just ignore the trendy wannabes .
I always get the Shabu-Shabu dinner and the beef is always fresh .
All I can say is they are fantastic .
Went here on sat 1/26 and was disappointed .
This little place is wonderfully warm welcoming .
I ordered a Chicken Teriyaki dish and found that the chicken was extremely dry .
Each time we 've been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return .
The white bean brushetta to start was incredible and the pasta was phenomenal .
One of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu in a positive way .
A bit breezy up there on the mezzanine from the wind coming from the tracks .
You should pass on the calamari .
The menu consisted of standard brassiere food , better then places like Balthazar etc .
We were worried we would have trouble getting in , but somehow managed to have a short wait .
the pad se ew chicken was delicious , however the pad thai was far too oily .
Given the incredible architecture surrounding it , this place has no character .
i have eaten here a handful of times , for no reason besides sheer convenience .
This place is great .
When we left at 8:00 PM , it was packed and noisy .
Forget the rush and the wait and the noise ( which is n't actually that bad ) , I mean please , who goes to a steakhouse to be coddled and romantic ?
The food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare , the dishes are never a disappointment .
Most of the servers are very attentive , friendly and quite attractive .
Hopefully next time , I will save room for dessert .
And they provided a delicious dessert on the house !
Food was average and creme brulee was awful - the sugar was charred , not caramelized and smelled of kerosene .
Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood .
Everything about this restaurant was special .
I have eaten a lot of pizza here .
And when I visit her I make it a point to eat at ' Ino at least once daily if not once for the whole trip .
Went here on a friend 's reccomendation .
The Singapore Mai Fun had NO curry flavor whatsoever .
Delivery is fast too .
Now at the top of our list , Del Frisco 's Steakhouse .
Warm , comfortable surroundings , nice appointments ( witness the etched glass and brickwork separating the dining rooms ) .
Another review here claimed the pre-fix was $ 29/per person including sake but it is $ 55 per person not including sake .
delicious bagels , especially when right out of the oven .
The service was outstanding .
I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan .
Cool atmosphere but such a let down .
My wife and I also enjoyed the spinach , the Shanghai low mein , and other attractions .
A little noise but I think that was because of our party !
This place has the best sushi in the city .
I had the black cod with yuzu sauce , which was wonderful .
So some of the reviews here are accurate about the crowd and noise .
esp . during happy hour !
First of all Dal Bukhara Rocks .
I come from a family of pizzeria owners , and I 'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in Fornino 's blows my families receipies away .
jazz singer had a nice voice + she made us all get up to dance to shake some cals to eat some more .
We went to Ino for Valentines .
They were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior .
The martinis are amazing and very fairly priced .
But the main hit was the whole grilled fish .
I love the place .
I in all reality felt as if I had just gotten off Air France and was in the 8th District in Paris .
Service , however , was excellent ... and I liked the setting/atmosphere a lot .
He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine .
Beef noodle soup is good as well .
Easily the worst stir-fried squid I 've ever tasted .
But too far east !
Sometimes tables do n't understand his sense of humor but it 's refreshing to have a server who has personality , professionalism , and respects the privacy of your dinner .
The flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal .
This diamond in the ruff is definitely worth my 10-minute walk from the 6 train .
It is expensive but well worth the money .
I love the fact that the pizza tastes so good and is so cheap .
now if they could only get a toaster .
Nice ambiance , nice little bar , good bartender , Francois , and good service .
The red sliding doors may be unique but they do not block off the cold air from the outside .
My friends and I go once a week ( minimum , we live in the area ) and everytime ca n't resist walking out ready to burst .
Vanison was good but not amazing .
THE BANANA PUDDING THEY SERVE HAS NEVER SEEN AN OVEN , THE CRABCAKES ARE WAY OVER SALTED AND DO N'T GET ME STARTED ON THE VERY GREASY MAC AND CHEESE .
And really large portions .
At first I was slightly skeptical because it was a sushi restaurant in the middle of NYC .
However , it is jus too good to not praise it .
Food was okay , nothing great .
Seriously , this place kicks ass .
We had the lobster sandwich and it was FANTASTIC .
As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited .
The french fries -- with the kalmata dip were terrific !
I went with my fiance on a Tuesday evening .
this is the best secret place in midtown ' , I heard that from the bartender , after having brilliant food ( try steak with portobello mushrooms ) and drinks on the bar last Tuesday .
My girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .
Our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken ( usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats ) .
I ca n't believe people complain about no cheese sticks ?
Raga 's is a romantic , cozy restaurant .
I had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the service was rude an unattentive .
The pizza was great .
The bartender on my most recent visit was so incredibly rude that I will never go back .
Authentic bistro !
After dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : Where are you from ... maybe you dont know how things work in America ... and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on .
Try the sea bass .
When I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else .
Try the cheesecake !
very good breads as well .
Quite frankly , this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried .
Eating at Ottimo is like eating in Chef Salvatore Esposito 's home .
Tiny dessert was $ 8.00 ... just plain overpriced for what it is .
Once you try it for a special occasion beware . . you ca n't stop !
Authentic Taiwanese food that 's cheap ... what more could you ask for ?
I usually go there later at night when I get off work so I do n't have to deal with crowds or lines .
One would think we 'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead , we got a snobby waiter would n't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so .
good food good wine that 's it .
We were then shooed inside .
The sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are innovative and delicious .
Definitely worth the trip to Battery Park City !
I ca n't wait to go back .
The service was extremely fast and attentive ( thanks to the service button on your table ) but I barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order .
I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others .
I wo n't go back unless someone else is footing the bill .
Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef .
All my co-workers were amazed at how small the dish was .
For each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink .
You can do it here .
It 's nice to find a place that is open 24 hours ( especially in downtown Brooklyn ) .
Saturday , Nov. 6th I had a group from work come in with about 35 people and the staff was amazing to accomodate us .
Decent wine at reasonable prices .
The drinks are a saving grace , but service staff , please , get over yourselves .
A fairly late entry into the haute barnyard sweepstakes , Flatbush Farm is n't in the same league as the Blue Hills or even the Farm on Adderlys of the world , but it 's pretty good , albeit with a somewhat dismal setting .
This is the only Thai place I go too in NYC , it 's wonderful , and live relaxed Jazz on certain nights .
The staff offers impeccable service .
Authentic Shanghai style and I can not recommend a better Shanghai place in New York .
We got most of it back at home with us .
Maitre-D - " Eat and get out "
We were not disappointed .
What came to our table was burned beyond recognition and stringy .
But the thai is definitely not great -- bland and indistinguished .
This is where the aforementioned line was .
The best thing I tasted were the lambchops .
The Pad Thai is excellent here , as well .
My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it .
The staff was knowledgeable and full of personality .
We were worried we would have trouble getting in , but somehow managed to have a short wait .
Loved it
The service we experienced was friendly and good .
I have never been disappointed but their true strength lays in their amazingly delicious and cheap lunch specials .
The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu , present your meal , and attend to your needs .
I 'm saving up for my next visit .
The appetizers are also delicious !
However , it just so happens that there 's an even more amazing place just down the street .
The wine list was superb , our tapas delightful , and the quiet atmosphere perfect for good conversation .
This place has good potential , but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else .
The place was quiet and delightful .
Give it a try and enjoy .
To me it exemplifies Soho , cute , artsy , interesting .
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE HEARTLAND BREWERY .
LLOOVVE THIS PLACE .
i would recommend reservations on weekends though .
I 've come here for casual lunches as well as for a friend 's birthday and I always enjoy myself .
This lovely French-Asian fusion restaurant stands out amongst other great restaurants on Smith Street .
The service was excellent - friendly and attentive .
Check it out .
But the staff was so horrible to us .
The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed .
Ambience is delightful , service impeccable .
The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world .
And the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating .
NO PIZZA 33 for me !
Please take my advice , go and try this place .
I would highly recommend Nina 's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming surrounding filled with candles and family pictures .
Alain Ducasse is the best of everything , I mean everything was excelent.I
The staff makes you feel at home , the food is great and the atmosphere is WONDERFUL !
In addition to great hot dogs , DOTP has wonderful breakfast sandwiches that feature , in addition to great things like tator tots and English muffins , a delicious NJ-based pork product know to us Jersey girls and boys as Taylor ham .
The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes .
The wait staff is very friendly , if not overly efficient .
As we were leaving , the couple standing by the door said to another waiter , we 're not in a hurry .
I love Ess-a-bagel , but I live on the west side , so I often go to Murray 's for convenience .
Reasonable prices .
Great food , great prices , great service .
We 've never had any problems with the staff but maybe we 've been lucky ?
I was speechless by the horrible food .
The photobook menu was a cute touch , certainly helped my group and I pick the fried chicken , pork chop , and noodle dishes that we all ordered .
I will not be coming here at 3am again .
I love this place !
This is the perfect date spot for Williamsburg couples .
Finally !
I will have to say , this Bengali Fast Food joint is clearly my favorite .
You fellas above says its the best Taiwanese restaurant in town .
Note that they do not serve beer , you must bring your own .
Just do n't take the seat between the bar and the back half of the restaurant , i saw a woman get nudged 40times sitting there .
Kind , attentive wait staff .
came here for restaurant week , did n't save much , but it was still great .
I will be going back very soon .
The service was poor , restaurant poorly lit , staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald 's than this joint .
We have been to this place many times , and always have great food , wine , and service .
At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at Bark you do n't just get your average hot dog .
At peak times , the restaurant is overcrowded and tables are uncomfortably close .
I would recommend to ask for a bigger sitting area when you make a reservation ( if possible )
When we sat , we got great and fast service .
Service is great , takeout is good too .
this without question is one of the worst hotdogs i have ever had .
They were such a rip-off ( $ 8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns ) and not worth trying .
For those prices and the dressed up atmosphere you expect more and should get more .
We ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun ( dessert ) recommended by the waiter .
Its good to go there for drinks if you do n't want to get drunk because you 'll be lucky if you can get one drink an hour the service is so bad .
The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed .
For myself and family we would only go here to celebrate an occassion , I do prefer smaller , quiter restaurants .
Great food , good wine and an excellent host .
Threw my fiance 's surprise 30th birthday dinner here could n't be happier .
I was so sad to read the bad reviews this place got !
The other times I 've gone it 's romantic date heaven , you can walk in get a booth by the windows , be treated like a VIP in a not-crowded place , with great food and service .
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose .
The food is decent at best , and the ambience , well , it 's a matter of opinion , some may consider it to be a sweet thing , I thought it was just annoying .
Again , no apology , no is there anything else I can get you , no can I get you a drink to make up for it , nothing !!!!
This place is so much fun .
Dinner took almost 4 hours without any lag time .
The staff is incredibly helpful and attentive .
First walking in the place seemed to have great ambience .
The pizza 's are made fresh , crispy , and ready to serve .
The location is perfect .
Its a go-to for dates as well as entertaining out of town guests .
Edible but really a ripoff at those prices given whats in the area .
It has good music , nice tapas , an interesting selection of wines ( primarily Spanish ) and a lowkey hip neighborhood clientele .
The family seafood entree was very good .
everyone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful .
Considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time , the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed .
Is just the way it was in days gone by .
We refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore .
Big and gawky on the outside .
The food was below average , the service was pathetic , there was no ambience at all .
Dumbfoundingly Poor
I was there on sat . for my birthday and we had an excellent time .
I recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great .
their brunch menu had something for everyone .
I thought I had died and gone to heaven .
The kitchen however , is almost always slow .
There restaurant is very casual , but perfect for lunch , and their delivery service is always very fast .
my wife and i have been going to nyc for years and would n't miss roxy , s food is expensive but it 's new york !
This place was the worst .
Probably much busier for lunch , it 's seldom crowded for dinner ( too close to downtown ) .
So sorry I ca n't rate this better .
We recently decided to try this location , and to our delight , they have outdoor seating , perfect since I had my yorkie with me .
After being told that our party of three would be seated in 10 minutes and watching other parties ( multiples of 2 and higher ) seated for 40 minutes , the three of us were squished into a small 2-person table .
I almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded .
I would recommend putting your name down and then getting a drink at a local bar first though because of the wait time .
The wait staff is very freindly , they make it feel like you 're eating in a freindly little european town .
The menu changed , portions were even smaller than before , a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility , a basmati rice dish lacked flavor .
If the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items BBQ-ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not-so-fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .
The floor was wet , the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor , no soap , and no hand towels left .
If you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave.
I have been twice to this restaurant .
I 've been living in the Columbia University area for about 10 years with 3 kids - now in their teens .
Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem !
I went to Amma after a friend recommended it .
Try the lasagnette appetizer .
Best Reuben sandwich ever !
Everything I had was good , and I 'm a eater .
It has been my first choice ever since I discovered it .
Impressed ...
The food is expensive , but worth every bite .
Going to Bark is always worth the train ride , and will make your tongue and belly very happy !
noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST !
Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable .
I 'd call it an ' italian dinner ' .
IT WAS HORRIBLE .
But on a lazy Saturday night , we ended up going .
I am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded .
While the staff at this little bistro is very friendly , I have never experienced more incompetency .
We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods .
Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers , no matter what the reviews say .
I 've been many time and have never been disappointed .
Delicious crab cakes too .
The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates .
What 's the difference between the two ?
Our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese .
The traditional Italian items are great - cheap and served in a cozy setting .
The desserts are more appealing then stuffy overpriced French restaurants .
Ok , so the servers wander around a little clueless , but there 's more than enough servers for the crowd they get -- it 's fine , you just have to make a small effort to get their attention .
Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes .
One of my Fav spots in the city .
Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there .
This is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates .
It 's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend .
Raga 's is a romantic , cozy restaurant .
My husband and I both ordered the Steak , medium .
Good crowd , good outdoor seating , with a hip japanese vibe .
I am happy i did the food was awsome .
My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary , and to our surprise it was fantastic .
I work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time .
The service was on point - what else you would expect from a Ritz ?
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service .
Get the soup and a nosh ( pastrami sandwich ) for $ 8 and you 're golden .
This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird .
That 's why you have to pay more for that .
Has the warmth of a family local yet it is a great place to watch sporting events .
it 's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food .
Go here if you want fresh and tasty salads of any type you can imagine .
Definitely try the taglierini with truffles - it was incredible .
The veal was incredible last night .
I was very impressed by this low-key upper eastsider and their authentically thai cuisine !!!
We do not need to go to a four-star restaurant anymore .
I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri .
Great vibe , lots of people .
I plan on eating here more often .
I ordered a Lassi and asked 4 times for it but never got it .
We 've been to Grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed .
Skip Baroanda down the street ( Eurotrashy , snooty and expensive ) and check this place out !
I 'm glad I did as the food was very good and the staff was friendly , courteous and efficient .
We were n't !
It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects .
great experience overall .
I really liked the noodle dishes at Rice Avenue compared to their Green Curry dish .
This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart 's and I must say how delicous the food and the service was .
I 've been here 3 times for lunch and it is one of my favorites in the city .
But I just would like to say I read the reviews people left and thats why I checked it out .
My boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent .
Go to Volare for 1st class service and terrific food .
If you are in search of the most authentic NYC deli experience look no further than the famous and historic Katz 's Deli down on the Lower East Side .
Food was OK - fish was cooked well .
Its located in greenewich village .
Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top .
Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza ( as I love La Pizza Fresca ) .
I was back-to-back with the diner at the table behind me and wait staff had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again .
Coming from Boston this place is like Emma 's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge ( although they have more funky toppings ! )
their dinner specials are fantastic .
moral stay away .
The service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served .
I 've been to this restaurant more than a dozen times and when I 'm craving for Pho , Lemon grass chicken or Beef Cube on rice , this is the place to go .
at night , but it 's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the music playing in the background is also voluminous .
Food is excellent .
Meanwhile , the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil , gratis .
I went for restaurant week and ordered off the prix fixe menu
the homemade Guacamole , the unbelievable entree , and thee most amazing deserts .
Compared to Ess-a , Tal offers a less doughy bagel !
I went to Common Stock for brunch and I was so impressed .
Dishes denoted as " Roy 's Classics " ( marked on the menu with asterisks ) are tried-and-true recipes , such as macadamia-crusted mahi mahi , or subtly sweet honey-mustard beef short ribs .
The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean .
I would recommend Roxy 's for that , but not for their food .
Service was very good - prompt , attentive and non-intrusive .
The food is consistently wonderful - I 've been coming here for years , and the owner has always been accomodating and friendly .
Sit back in one of those comfortable chairs .
Horrible food and Horrible service .
There are many Thai places in the city but so far Toons is # 1 .
We ate outside at Haru 's Sake bar because Haru 's restaurant next door was overflowing .
Yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously , but it should n't .
The chicken and falafel platters were nondescript combinations with fresh leaf salad .
I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one .
Atmosphere is a bore .
But the meals were terrible .
still stay away , the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were serves eventhough they were there much longer ...
From the appetizers we ate , the dim sum and other variety of foods , it was impossible to criticize the food .
Creative dishes like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette and fettuccine with grilled seafood in a rosemary-orange sauce are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable bistro menu .
I almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded .
I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks !
This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down .
I have never had cheescake like this .
This is the BEST Shabu-Shabu Restaurant in the Try-State Area .
Even if the food was n't this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax .
The flavors robust and subtle .
I was highly disappointed by their service and food .
Our visit their to say the least , was an unpleasant and costly experience !
It 's somewhere you can eat and be happy .
Everything is for sale in here including the sculptured iron statue on the table .
The main downside to the place is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level .
The food was actually aweful .
The food is mostly made from scratch , fresh and well prepared .
The bread is the soft paratha bread ( unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta ) , and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful .
Guaranteed to be a tasty experience ! )
My quesadilla tasted like it had been made by a three-year old with no sense of proportion or flavor .
Our friends have not arrived yet .
The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome , great appetizer to share !
Well , this place is so Ghetto its not even funny .
Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer .
my first time here was with my gf for our 12 month anniversary .
I knew upon visiting NYC that I wanted to try an orginal deli .
I HATE HATE HATE this place .
those rolls were big , but not good and sashimi was n't fresh .
Still we keep going back : )
They came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant .
Last time I went here , the waitress did n't come back after taking our order .
Good Experience
The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I 've had at this price range .
Certainly not the best sushi in New York , however , it is always fresh , and the place is very clean , sterile .
THE LASAGNA WAS PROBABLY THE BEST I HAVE TASTED .
It may be a bit packed on weekends , but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area .
Ok , for all of us growing up in the Village of NYC , we have spoiled by a plethora of restaurants , most of which stay open very late .
The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts .
Been there , done that , and New York , it 's not that big a deal .
Build a meal with side orders like Amazin ' Greens salads , Buffalo Chicken Kickers and Cinna Stix .
I do n't get it either .
Moderate prices .
The folding chair I was seated at was uncomfortable .
Food was very good , but not what I would consider out of this world .
The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared .
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!
This was a great surprise .
Tuk Tuk is one of the rare choices for me to go in Brooklyn .
And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ?
The service is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the food arrives .
The Waitstaff were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal .
The food is good , I ca n't lie .
Ciao Bella
for my birthday and we had an excellent time .
The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day .
Amma is nothing special .
If you venture off the island of Manhattan and ca n't seem to find a great Italian restaurant , drive to Corona .
Other guests enjoyed pizza , santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips .
The food is so good and so popular that waiting can really be a nightmare .
All pretty good .
The quality of food at this restaurant accompanied by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10 !
Excellent food , although the interior could use some help .
Also very inexpensive .
Diner food at bistro prices is a bummer ....
There are numerous shavue restaurants in LA , but few out here .
The overall price tag was very very expensive , something I did expect .
Great wine selection , Gigondas is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value .
The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance .
I 'm partial to the Gnocchi .
enough said !
It took them 15 minutes to put water in our glasses .
However , I think this place is a good hang out spot .
I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try .
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience .
The best pad thai i 've ever had .
We were charged full price .
This place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city .
If you 're looking for a great meal at a decent price , go to Del Frisco 's !
Do yourself a favor and walk the extra avenue from joe 's to eat here .
I loved it and will be back soon .
If you are here as a pre-show meal , hop in a cab and take the extra 10 minutes to go to the uptown location .
But trust me it is so worth it .
Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting .
The food was so-so .
Pizza here is consistently good .
We were less than impressed .
Besides , we were on vacation !
Best Indian food I have ever eaten .
BUt their best dish is thh Thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a dish that would cost $ 23.95 is most places , but it is $ 16 here .
It hits the spot every time
I ate here for the first time and absolutely loved it !
We recently spent New Year 's Eve at the restaurant , and had a great experience , from the wine to the dessert menu .
The grilled cheese at home afterwards was better . !!
A Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner ?
Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything .
Our waitress was sweet and accomodating , not overbearing .
I 've never ordered anything else from their menu ... there 's no need to .
Guess what , I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , " oh well , I wish you would have said something earlier " No apology , nothing .
Service is not what you are coming here for ...
My husband and I both ordered the Steak , medium .
Try their plain pizza with fresh garlic or eggplant .
The service was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the cod with pineapple tempura .
I was visiting New York City with a friend and we discovered this really warm and inviting restaurant .
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines .
So close , but not good enough .
This is a true gem of the village .
Great food and the prices are very reasonable .
While their kitchen food is delicious , their Sushi is out of this world .
The food arrived in about 15 minutes .
In about 12 minutes , the thing is gone .
I like Mamoun 's food as well , but side by side , Kati Rolls just produce tastier food hands down .
The food here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it .
and there 's no way out .
They charge $ 6.00 for rice .
This place has the best pizza .
They 're are better Taiwanese restaurants and they are located in Flushing , Queens .
It 's a great place to order from or sit-in .
We were seated promptly as we had reservations , however after that the service was slow .
Their coffee is quite good too !
They even scoop it out nice ( for those on a diet ) not too much not to little .
highly recommended .
Try the chocolate mud cake ( warmed ) with 2 scoops of dulce de leche gelato .
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm .
I 've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years : A new Jazz Bar , the most fantastic Dining Garden , the Best Thin Crust Pizzas , and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for ( these are not your average lasagnas ) !
The service is ok but could be better .
The food was really good , I had the onion soup and it was one of the best ever .
With the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room .
The service was excellent and the food was delicious .
When I 'm feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office , I head for Cafe St. Bart 's .
The service was pretty poor all around , the food was well below average relative to the cost , and outside there is a crazy bum who harasses every customer who leaves the place .
My co-workers had to wait almost an hour for delivery , only to discover that what they got was not what they ordered .
Interesting selection , good wines , service fine , fun decor .
And the staff is also young , energeic and hot !!!!
Wonderful at holiday time .
The food however , is what one might expect .
The food here was mediocre at best .
When I called this morning , I did n't think I would be able to get in at 12 , but I was able to get in , along with four other guests .
Great , original taste .
Ciao Bella
Arigato Gozimas Yuka !
Another plus is most of the entrees are approx .
I was wrong .
Not sure where the previous reviewer , lonk , dined , but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food !
Decent wine selection too .
And affordable .
It 's just good food , nothing more and that 's all we want !
What I did n't like was how the food came right after it was ordered .
Fantastic !
since the first time I came here I 've been hooked .
My wife and I were in NYC celebrating our 30th anniversary .
But the pizza is way to expensive .
Decor needs to be upgraded but the food is amazing !
the salads are delicious , both refreshing and very spicy .
The main entree was also very good .
The waiters ALWAYS look angry and even ignore their high-tipping regulars .
Young neighborhood trendies graze at the counter during the day , while chic , art-house drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night .
Was surprisingly disappointed .
it helps if you know what to order .
Anyways , if you 're in the neighborhood to eat good food , I would n't waste my time trying to find something , rather go across the street to Tamari .
That place was awesome , , , sally !
Bring your appetites .
The food now is inconsistent .
Do n't waste your time , or money !!
I was pretty much full after our fondue appetizer .
I 'd definitely go back again .
Everyone must come here at least once .
The anti-pasta was excellent , especially the calamari , as were the filling pasta mains .
I would highly recommend it .
i actually feel like i should keep it a secret .
I got the $ 10 10-piece dim sum combo , every bite of which was great .
We ordered dosut bibimbap and nakgi-bokum .
We had a good time .
The steak melted in my mouth .
The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were .
Okay , so I never write but there does n't seem to fair balance of positive to negative reviews concerning Green Bo and it 's time to speak up - I live in Chinatown .
Why make a reservation if you are n't going to keep it ?
To finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have dessert , especially the White Chocolate Bread Pudding with Gelato and hot chocolate .
Even though the restaurant was packed , we were seated promptly and even asked for a table upstairs with no problems .
If you venture off the island of Manhattan and ca n't seem to find a great Italian restaurant , drive to Corona .
Well , it happened because of a graceless manager and a rude bartender who had us waiting 20 minutes for drinks , and then tells us to chill out .
Definitely Highly NOT recommended .
Here you get the zen feel without feeling rigid .
if you 're looking for perfect traditional sushi , go here - if you 're looking for interesting combinations , try sushi of gari 's ( east side ) .
The dosas are skimpy , unattractive and drip with grease , and personally I 'd drink popcorn topping before I 'd eat another one of these .
My father had the flank steak which was very good , and my mother had the swordfish .
Great food , great prices , great service .
Try sushimi cucumber roll .
This is the Jackel and Hideof the restaurants on the UES .
Keep up the good work guys !
Ruby Foo 's is a tourist trap .
We went to eat at the Jekyll and Hyde restaurant on Friday night and really enjoyed the fun atmosphere and good food .
I 'm almost tempted to give this place a bad review so I can keep the crowds away ... been going there on and off for a year now and it 's really my fave hang out in the city .
We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh .
From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff , I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it .
What more could you want ?
If presentation and service is your thing , then this magic show works .
My wife and I recently visited the bistro for dinner and had a wonderful experience .
Tasty steak , pork loin , the works .
We 've tried before but it always packed and does n't take reservations .
My husband and I enjoyed each of the 6 taste size portions and left completely full .
Service was quick .
They are served with a free appetizer and the portions are perfect for lunch .
With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored .
The stuff tilapia was horrid ... tasted like cardboard .
The staff is also attentive and friendly .
We 've always gotten amazing service and we love the food .
A word to the wise - the Hoboken health inspector clued me to his findings that this is THE cleanest restaurant in town .
Both a number of the appetizer and pasta specials were amazing .
Stick to the gulab jamun .
I suspect this restaurant is what Rao 's would be if it had n't turned exclusive .
I lived on 50th st , and wanted Indian one day so decided to check this place out .
We walked in on a Wednesday night and were seated promptly .
Great Indian food
Both times we waited well over a half hour for a table ( even though we had reservations ) .
Satay is one of those favorite haunts on Washington where the service and food is always on the money .
I do n't get it , what 's so special about Prune ?
Give it a try and enjoy .
Sit outside in the warm weather ; inside for cozy winter .
Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square .
By the time we were done , it was past 1:00 am .
Place is open till late , no dress code .
The manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group .
Great service , great food .
My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time !
Horrible .
good music , great food , speedy service affordable prices .
The buffet had a nice selection .
Montparnasse 's desserts -- especially the silken creme brulee and paper-thin apple tart -- are good enough on their own to make the restaurant worth the trip .
Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them .
Wow .
Metrazur has a beautiful spot overlooking the main terminal .
You 're going to drop some coin , but completely worth it , especially if you are looking to impress someone .
My personal favorite is Nick and Joe 's .
The dishes are remarkably tasty and such a cozy and intimate place !
To sum it up : Service varies from good to mediorce , depending on which waiter you get ; generally it is just average Ok .
Everything we had was good or ok .... but definitely nothing great .
PERFECT FOR DATES !
It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy , creamy , and slightly buttery .
The wine list is interesting and has many good values .
I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee ( rice porridge ) .
As to my comment about the food , no apology or acknowledgment was made .
The service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing .
