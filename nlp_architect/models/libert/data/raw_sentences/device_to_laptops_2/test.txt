My ONLY issues are : 1 ) the screen/video resolution wo n't increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60
Took a long time trying to decide between one with retina display and one without .
This computer does n't do that well with certain games it ca n't play some and it becomes too hot while playing games .
Ok , this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by Apple .
The majority of the reviews seem to be for the 13.3 MacBook Pro Model # MD101LL/A .
System is loosing about 20 % of performance because of that .
The memory was gone and it was not able to be used .
Keyboard is reasonable size .
It just works out of the box and you have a lot of cool software included with the OS .
iTunes is a handy music-management program , and it is essential for anyone with an iPod .
This computer literally takes about five minutes to start up and to be able to use without it crawling and I DO mean crawling .
Long story short , since I experience so many problems with my laptop every since I bought it from day one , I did n't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what I pay for a crapy laptop , but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year , they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services , they finally gave in .
Again in February my computer completely failed to the point that it could not load Windows so I contacted Acer to get it fixed thru my Warrenty and it took about 3 days fighting on the phone with agents and it seemed as though NONE of them spoke English .
The reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me ( I prefer it dark ) or if you can crank up the brightness .
5 months dead again .
What 's really great about this product is you may have a family member who is computer illiterate and you can pretty much just let them loose on this computer without any real supervision .
Using this machine is like a mild form of torture .
Now that I have upgraded to Lion I am much happier about MAC OS and have just bought an iMac for office .
Such as PAGES , NUMBERS , and so on .
And it did n't show up on the reciept , I do n't know how we ordered it online !
We purchased this as a back up computer after our more expensive HP needed to be repaired .
He came into my house , fiddled around on the computer for a good forty minutes and got ready to leave before it was even done doing what he was doing to it .
working with Mac is so much easier , so many cool features .
I gave it to my daughter because I just hated the screen , hated that it had no cd drive to at least play cd 's when I wanted to listen to music and do schoolwork .
My computer froze on several occasion , had buttons that randomely would fall off and even had moments when the computer would refuse to turn on at all .
Everything is so easy to use , Mac software is just so much simpler than Microsoft software .
I would rate this computer at 5 stars , but considering it has a short life span I can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine .
I also like the acer arcade but these were reallythe only two things I liked about this laptop .
My Mac is much more efficient than a PC so it does not need the extra bells and whistles to compete .
Its a good laptop for its value .
I feel that enough people have Macs these days and that companies need to start making things more compatable than they used to be .
The minute you fire it up it 's all good , very easy user interface .
I had a USB connect but , i ca n't use it because it is not compatible .
Every driver on the drivers/applications DVD is everything you will need for a reload .
I sit down and use my husband 's work PC and I do n't like it one bit .
I 'm pretty sure when I bought it , my bank account went ' ouch !
It allows you to automatically upload photos to your Facebook account with one click .
The machine is speedy and efficient .
I had the staff telling me older version did not make the fan noise cause it is a " different " computer .
When this happened I would have to completely power off my computer and restart it .
I would definitely recommend checking out this laptop if you are in the market for one .
ive never had a problem with it !
I expected so as it 's an Apple product , but I was glad to see my expectations exceeded , this is THE laptop to buy right now .
The newer MacBook that I have purchased is one of the best computers .
Awesome graphics !
The latest is on my LG Netbook X12
Only problem that I had was that the track pad was not very good for me , I only had a problem once or twice with it , But probably my computer was a bit defective .
I have n't used it for anything high tech yet , but I love it already .
The bottom-line is that this laptop just is n't worth it .
I am also upset with CR for giving a good rating .
I am ADDICTED to photo booth !
I even got my teenage son one , because of the features that it offers , like , iChat , Photobooth , garage band and more !
I bought this laptop and found its TAB is not functioning .
I have the A65 - right now it 's a paperweight .
I have owned it only two months !
I Contacted HP about this situation and was given excuses , without results .
The battery life was supposed to be 6 hours , but even if I ran off the battery with the high effeciency setting the battery would only last me on average about 2.5 to 3 hours .
If you have the money I suggest going for the i7 .
In my opinion it was not as user friendly as I expected either .
- Complied to their protocol , called number , made " case " , got an email address to send complaint .
Harddrive was in poor condition , had to replace it .
Sad very SAD .
1st hand experience is very important , especially for a new customer .
I run windows via bootcamp for the couple programs I do not want to buy a mac version of , like my cad programs .
So far so good with this laptop .
A seventy dollar mouse !
The macbook pro is really responsive .
and they replaced the awesome ergonomic small lightweight power supply with a power supply that weighed more than the machine itself .
Now I had not tried to use this since the disc drive had been replaced and after taking it back to the Geek Squad I found out they had accidently not used the right drive when they replaced the first one , so back it went to get the correct drive .
Me and my boyfriend bought the Gateway NV78 in nov of 09 .
From the speed to the multi touch gestures this operating system beats Windows easily .
Honestly , I spent more time waiting for it to unfreeze then actually doing what I got on there for !
As well as having the plug in the computer come loose .
It has enough memory and speed to run my business with all the flexibility that comes with a laptop .
I sent it back and found this time that the battery was faulty , so I got a new one and some other fixes they found .
It is VERY easy to type on and feels great - besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted .
also ... - excellent operating system - size and weight for optimal mobility - excellent durability of the battery - the functions provided by the trackpad is unmatched by any other brand -
But sadly the replacement froze-up while updating the BIOS again and shut down and would not turn back on .
If you faintly come close to touching this thing while typing , all craziness may break loose .
I 've had hp desktop for over 4 yrs now and not one days goes by that i do n't regret buying it .
The computer was shipped to their repair depot on june 24 and returned on July 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned .
this one , in my opinion , might be a lemon !
Well i got this computer from Best Buy and I have had nothing but problems I bought the computer with a virus .....
In November my computer messed up entirely and would n't power on after intalling a Windows update , I had to have my HD flashed and lost EVERYTHING on it , including my school assignments and irriplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things , when this update was installed for some reason I was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installed it deleted my history .
this computer is a little more expensive than any pc but it will last you longer and it worth every penny .
Let me tell you , this machine is great .
I plan on using my MacBook Pro for a long time .
My only other complaint is that it gets really hot .
Battery is lasting about 6 hours as I am surfing the web on Sundays while checking football scores and watching funny Youtube videos .
The only downfall is the battery only last 1.5-2 .0 hrs when not plugged in .
You may soon mistake my digitus medius as a lively pogo stick .
To be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk .
Runs Hot I thought we were paying for quality in our decision to buy an Apple product .
The one thing that Apple does right is computers .
This unit is not .
it does get hot when using on a bed or sofa and gets warm on a desk .... this is in an un-air conditioned room ..... in air condition it gets slightly warm ......
It has served my needs quite nicely for the most part .
It turns out that this hp pc had been preciously sold by Wal Mart .
This computer gets very hot , before shutting down .
I 've almost have bought every generation of MacMinis since 2005 , and this one has n't let me down .
the programs are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like a charm .
everything about a mac is wonderful , it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new system , but you will learn fast and its all worth it .
Good in every aspect .
Once again , I was told it was the suspicious power supply problem .
It makes doing schoolwork at night so much easier .
The first one sent : Touchpad did n't work The second sent : USB did n't work The third sent : Touchpad did n't work The fourth sent : Has n't arrived yet .
I believe that the quality of a mac is worth the price .
First of all yes this is a mac and it has that nice brushed aluminum .
They are so realistic I am just speechless .
The new operating system makes this computer into a super iPad .
- Stay away from Apple , or hope you laptop does not break down .
1 ) Payed $ 2200 for a " premium " laptop
I was a little weary at purchasing another 13 " macbook almost 2 years later but t looks like the newer macbooks have gotten its current line of graphics cards in order this time around .
I love the quick start up .
All I will say now is that it was over two grand less expensive and so much better quality than my hunk of crap Vaio .
She said its very user friendly .
I called back to ensure that received it , they had .
They are wonderful , but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat .
PC users use the Powerpoint program for slide-show presentation and Mac users utilize Keynote .
It 's so nice to look at and the keys are easy to type with .
So we exchanged it for the same on and after 2 hours it did n't work .
lightweight , long battery life , excellent transition from PC ;
After years of using PCs , a new Mac user is basically forced to re-learn how to use a computer .
It was kind of a rebellion against PC in fact , and I am certainly glad I did .
Other installed features , such as certain printer software , are also most attractive .
Fully charged , the MacBook Pro can last about five hours unplugged .
Note that I do n't ordinarily take the time to write a review .
This machine is flawless , fast , and classy .
Overall for the money this is a good deal .
Cons : Screen resolution .
I never had this kind of quality issue with Dell ( not to say Dell is that great ) , not with a brand new laptop .
I love this 13 " Mac white unibody .
He 's thrilled with his new laptop .
It 's the mid 2012 version .
The Dell mini was the first Dell product that I had ever purchased .
first i have been searching for long time before i decided to get mac .
Despite the plethora of problems , I managed to use technological trickery to keep the machine operational for two years .
The laptop is relatively simple to use , though I bought Macs for Dummies , which is well worth $ 2
I am paying apple to kill my self and my wallet .
About 1/2 of the sites I need to visit because of my work contain some type of Flash .
I really wish I had done this years ago .
Its worth every Penny .
This Notebook restarts every time there is a new update , so if you do n't save your files and information , everything will be lost .
Images are crisp and clean .
She tells me about it all the time but I tend to shut off all cognitive functions when she gets that yapper going .
You may need to special order a bag .
Their products , including the MBP , are beautiful , sleek and clever .
We are addicted to the Mac .
I ' ts nice to have the higher-end laptops , but this fits my budget and the features I need .
The OS is great .
Web access through the 3G network is so slow , it 's very frustrating and VERY DISAPPOINTING .
It seems to have some opions that are intalled but do not work like I thought they would .
Bought with a credit card .
Plus two finger clicking as a replacement for the right click button is surprisingly intuitive .
It 's fast , light , and is perfect for media editing , which is mostly why I bought it in the first place .
Strengths : Well-shaped Weaknesses : A bad videocard !
Apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached .
The Awesomest of the awesomest .
It is a great computer for that and I have to say I 'm happy I switched .
I have never had an experience like this .
Amazing Performance for anything I throw at it .
Sometimes the screen even goes black on this computer .
Obviously we both got new Macs .
Its pretty much fire it up and go .
It is easy to use , its keyboard easily accommodates large hands , and its weight is fantasic .
Two of the times was in one month .
Instead of taking another chance on Toshiba , I went with an Asus G73JH-x3 .
For those that care about noise this thing does n't really make any ;
and then , a guy came out to serve me instead .
DO NOT BUY GATEWAY COMPUTERS THEY ARE JUNK AND THE WARRANTY COMPANY IS HORRIBLE .
When considering a Mac , look at the total cost of ownership and not just the initial price tag .
I 'm so disgusted that I wasted my money on this product .
I loved it .
I was said it 's videocard .
Externally the keys on my keyboard are falling off , after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit , and the screen has a terrible glare .
I had a little problem adjusting to the small screen but works fine as long as I remember to carry my glasses .
Toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought Toshiba will do nothing about it .
I am loyal to Apple .
I find it not to be very user friendly .
Even though the computer is larger they did not make the keyboard larger .
Here are the things that made me confident with my purchase : Build Quality - Seriously , you ca n't beat a unibody construction .
But when I received my replacement , I made BOTH recovery DVDs ( 4 ) , and a driver/application DVD .
Nothing bad to say about it .
I can guarantee this will be the last Dell I will ever purchase !
Buying a Mac Mini would allow me to make the transition .
Even so , I like playing online games , so it was wonderful that there is a feature where I can dualboot Windows .
I spent months looking for a good laptop for me and I finally found it !
Very powerful especially for the money .
I HATE this one .
It 's the most wonderful thing in the entire world .
Easy learning curve .
The computer itself was fast , ran smoothly , and had no problems .
This netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop ( my wife and I have another laptop ) , or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks .
" > iPhoto is probably the best program I have ever worked with : easy and convenient .
The feature are good enough for what I need .
He said quite a number of people had encountered this problem and said it is a common issue .
I really wanted a Mac over a pc because I used a Mac in high school .
Mac also has many apps and programs that are quite cheap or free .
User upgradeable RAM and HDD .
It 's super fast and a great value for the price !
Gave phonenumber .
Great purchase and I definitely did n't miss out on the Black Friday deals .
I hate it .
Then 2 of my nephews were going into music and both fell in love with the MacBook Pro .
I love my Samsung TV and Galaxy S smartphone , but this Netbook was a very poor computer .
This Macbook Pro is fast , powerful , and runs super quiet and cool .
I took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and I finally paid about 1500 for the extended warranty .
might have to buy one for me now , since I use it all the time .
It is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an Alienware gaming machine .
Oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all I use the old word processer which works good .
It is very slim , the track pad is very much impressed with me .
I do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it , however I would highly suggest purchasing a stand however , due to the nature of the design of the macbook as it is one very large heat sink .
After 3 pleasant weeks of use , the laptop just died .
Now for the hardware problems .
With the needs of a professional photographer I generally need to keep up with the best specs .
I finally decided on this one and could n't be any happier .
One night I turned the freaking thing off after using it , the next day I turn it on , no GUI , screen all dark , power light steady , hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does .
The built-in webcam is great for Skype and similar video-chat services .
Since I keyboard over 100 wpm , I look for a unit that has a comfortble keyboard ( no keys sticking or lagging , strange configuration of " extra key " , etc .
This is my first computer purchase
It 's fast , quiet , incredibly small and affordable compared to other Mac models .
Great Performance and Quality .
It all just makes sense .
This was around three years , maybe four years ago .
It feels cheap , the keyboard is not very sensitive .
I did a lot of research and ended up thinking this Toshiba was the best one for me .
The port is secured to motherboard so when this happens you ca n't see the plug at all , it 's just gone .
The display on this computer is the best I 've seen in a very long time , the battery life is very long and very convienent .
The netbook is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me .
the apple pro notebook will not let you down .
Although i do believe that Windows operating system may be to fault for some of the problems .
After the warrenty expired the hard drive went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace .
The first programm I switched on was a game for my children .
I called apple and no solution .
I told them that I just received my brand new MacBook but I was having issues .
Sells for the same as a netbook without sacrificing size .
While lacking some of the functions of the other versions , this was very acceptable for the uses planned for this computer .
I 've been a PC user and I just finally switched and I am never going back .
But for now , this laptop is still a workhorse .
Very very disappointed !
Just for a stupid CD .
Solution : it turned out to be pretty simple .
when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase .
I thought learning the Mac OS would be hard , but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a PC .
Do n't get me wrong , I am no Microsoft hater , I 've just managed to turn into a much bigger Apple fan because of this machine .
I always have used a tower home PC and jumped to the laptop and have been very satisfied with its performance .
The overall build quality of the unit is excellent and she 'd recommend it to anyone else looking for a netbook .
it definitely beats my old mac and the service was great .
The brand of iTunes has just become ingrained in our lexicon now , but keep in mind that Apple started it all .
This was the same problem with my MacBook ( circa 2007 ) that I just retired .
I should have spent an extra hundred bucks and got a full sized computer .
Then after paying for it to be examined I was told it was same problem cited on website but I 'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty .
Best commuter I have ever owned .
I 'm a professional consultant , and a client needed work on her machine .
Well , maybe I was just very unlucky .
So noise is reduced at least 50 % and the heat is much better , now it does n't feel hot but warm .
the mbp i recieved was everything it should have been .
The Mac Snow Leopard O/S is extremely easy to use , although very different than Win XP , Visa or Win7 .
When we bought our new HP comouter in Dec. of 2008 , we wanted Windows XP , but were told it would cost an extra $ 159 , so we went with Vista .
I had always used PCs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive .
Should be there by the end of the week ( again ... ) .
This computer was so challenging to carry and handle .
Apple is living up to its name with the mini and , for our needs , it 's perfect .
We 'll save our money to replace it with a Mac again !
I like it better than my big Dell Laptop .
The tech guy then said the service center does not do 1-to-1 exchange and I have to direct my concern to the " sales " team , which is the retail shop which I bought my netbook from .
But the arm velcro is torn after one use .
I bought this laptop Was the worst Laptop I 've ever bought .
Applications open in seconds and there are no lags , hiccups or awkward moments when you wonder whether your computer is out for tea .
When I finally had everything running with all my software installed I plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed .
I am very satisfied with the mini .
If you do n't like fingerprints , this might not be the laptop for you .
NO good .
not something you want to miss out on !!!
I 'm definitely not hard on laptops and guarantee 100 % that no liquid has touched this machine in my presence .
But to be honest , I do n't use my computer for anything like graphics editing and complex data analysis and gaming .
Strong performance in this device makes use of fun and a strong sense of the era of speed This device serves all modern requirements is a very strong game and is very useful for designers .
It is by far one of the greatest investments I have ever made .
Besides being elegant , the MacBooks are durable .
And the fact that Apple is driving the 13 " RMBP with the Intel4000 graphic chip seems underpowered ( to me .
I have a lapdesk which I can use , but I can still feel the heat through the foam and plastic .
The i5 blows my desktop out of the water when it comes to rendering videos .
Some features arent friendly ( volume wheel , sound quality , etc .
When it broke I wanted another Acer and chose the V5 .
I simply got tired of a bad computer like windows with its constant freezing and anti-virus .
Easy to set up and go !
You will regret it if you buy any dell .
Its small enough where I can take it pretty much anywhere , but still has a big enough screen to get everything done .
Needs constant repair .
The flaws are , this computer is not for computer gamers because of the OS X.
I can do everything I could before , only faster and more efficiently .
Still trying to learn how to use it .
THis computer may be small but it is one heck of a power horse .
while about 8 years ago , I hope that the quality has changed .
Do yourself a favor , this is not a fake story trying to hurt alienware ...
Perfect -- thanks so .
Microsoft word was not on it andI had to buy it seperately .
Sorry Toshiba , but 1st impressions do count for something .
i setup my password last night with the password on my other computer .
Was disappointed to find out that the model had been discontinued , apparently because of known motherboard problems .
The most recent being that my Safari internet browser is freaking out on me , but I have just been using firefox instead .
They refuse .
The product is prefect for everyone .
and it has blue screen crashed on me twice .
The local computer repair shops send out ads that say along the lines of we can fix almost any problem or computer usually even the trouble some Toshiba satellite .
Guess I 'll stay away from HP .
I bought this eMachines Notebook PC in January of this year and I am highly dissatisfied with it .
The problem I had with this unit was unresolvable .
Have returned that laptop unused .
Never been happier using computer .
My main reason to convert was the imovie program .
It is easy to navigate and update programs .
I thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer would n't go onto our wireless network and I would n't have the same problems because it was updated .
I will never buy another HP computer .
believe me apple has a reputation .
EITHER WAY , THE KEYBOARD IS UNSATISFACTORY .
The battery life is excellent , the display is excellent , and downloading apps is a breeze .
12.44 seconds to boot .
If the number of patrons in the Apple store are any indication , HP and other PC manufacturers need to take note .
So do n't get it .
they had to replace the motherboard in April
Adjust the sensitivity since it 's not that responsive to begin with .
both upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary Product Key .
From the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer !
No hassle and no complaints .
Then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me .
BEST BUY - 5 STARS + + + ( sales , service , respect for old men who are n't familiar with the technology ) DELL COMPUTERS - 3 stars DELL SUPPORT - owes a me a couple
Before i bought my new i5 , I did my research for about 2 weeks and determined to move for HP to Apple for reliability , dependable , and long lasting operations .
I really like the Mac 15.4 in . Notebook , but its very pricey .
The ease of set up was terrific .
So in late March , early April 2009 I was without it again for a couple weeks while I had online courses I had to complete and my fiance was in Afghanistan and web conferencing was the best communication method we had .
I was also able to install and use my Photoshop and AfterEffects programs easily .
Thus , when you carry it at a slanted angle , the screen will " topple " or " slide " down , if you understand what I mean .
I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality !
There are no gold key numbers too intall programs , you must use the serial numbers that it does not accept and then things are limited as far a working because they are only good for a short time .
but it has a major design flaw .
I 'm going to try and keep my old G4 on the road for as long as possible .
Its still going .
I thought that it will be fine , if i do some settings .
I had less problems .
Great overall .
English must have been his third or fourth language .
That whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $ 175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $ 175 and it was fixed .
Also the speakers are not very loud , But it is a netbook .
iPhotos is an excellent program for storing and organizing photos .
I was so excited when my dad said i could get a new laptop for my birthday .
I was tired of going without my laptop every few weeks .
It had a cooling system malfunction after 10 minutes of general use , and would not move past this error .
Well , maybe more like week one .
I did contact HP and share how unhappy I am .
I look forward to years of use , it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well .
Apparently under the screen there are 2 little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth , they come loose .
Very dissappointed becase I have had toshibas for years , and never a issue .
My MacBook is faster than any comparable PC .
I dont understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing .
Am very glad I bought it , great netbook , low price .
If you are looking for something reliable , this is the laptop for you .
The only time I have restarted is during system updates .
Could n't keep a page up you were working on !
It is a REAL touchpad , not the toy I saw in other brands .
For the use it was purchased for it is a good Laptop .
I am very happy I bought this Mac , well worth the extra money .
Bought this gateway M-50 or 150 early 2007 .
Definitely worth spending the money on it .
On start up it asks endless questions just so itune can sell you more of their products .
I should have checked this before I installed my applications .
But the machine is awesome and iLife is great and I love Snow Leopard X.
You 'll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them .
I have just had to learn to be a little harder typer than on my last computer .
I hope to edit this in the next few hours , I am going to try to install my own copy of Windows 7 .
Searched it on amazon and on bestbuy .
The start menu is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking .
Many kinds of software that is necessary to the working person is not available and can not be downloaded .
The cover for the DVD drive soon came off , too -- a mark of poor construction quality .
I have been a mac user since the mid 90s .
Not good for a person who gets online daily .
And I may be the only one but I am really liking Windows 8 .
the mcbook pro notebook will make it easy for you to write and read your emails at blazing speeds .
Again , decent comp for the price , and I was in need of one quickly as my other laptop died on me .
As an owner of a Toshiba Satalite laptop computer things you should know before you buy .
This is no exception .
And the screen on this thing is absolutely amazing for high quality videos and movies and gaming .
It 's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook .
After purchasing this thing , I find out that I need a special interface device to connect my camera , and that it can not be purchased at the store - only on line .
I had to return it because it would n't even start .
The acer one computer that I bought is 17 ince screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it , but I like the big screen on it .
I have found a lot of online sources to help me but think that I would have learned a lot quicker if I would have taken the class .
Yes , the computer was light weight , less expensive than the average laptop , and was pretty self explantory in use .
i love ths notebook .
i think that anyone looking for a good durrable laptop then this is the way to go .
The battery life has not decreased since I bought it , so i 'm thrilled with that .
Sadly Apple has discontinued this MacBook , I think it was never super popular since it fell somewhere in between the cheapest white model and the smaller Pros .
I especially like the keyboard which has chiclet type keys .
After doing extensive research , macconnection had the lowest price on the 15 " MBP i5 .
I can actually get work done with this MAC , and not fight with it like my tired old PC laptop .
This is the first Apple product that I have purchased .
All-in-all , I would definitely recommend this product for nearly everyone .
I would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of grabage .
The So called laptop Runs to Slow and I hate it !
My husband purchased a laptop at the same time for about $ 300 less ( he got a pc ) .
In addition , there is photo detection software that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the picture .
Overall this laptop is great .
It 's a great prodcut to handle basic computing needs .
The size is perfect and I do not recomend anything bigger except for any person who can exceed the limited space it gives you .
Shipping was quick and product described was the product sent and so much more ...
The processor screams , and because of the unique way that Apple OSX 16 functions , most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software .
Luckily , for all of us contemplating the decision , the Mac Mini is priced just right .
I also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad .
They also have a longer service life than other computers ( I have several friends who still use the older Apple PowerBooks ) .
Speakers does n't sound that great .
Maybe this is virus related , maybe not , but the computer has locked up many times , and on two occasions , the screen has simply gone black .
This computer was bought because I wanted " top of the line " , fast , reliable , HA .
i would have to say that overall its great !
HP did n't fix it .
This time the mouse pad and right click key would n't work !
I have not have any problems .
I found this laptop on sale for under 6000 at Best Buy which was a great deal !
It is fast booting up , shutting down , and connection with the internet .
They went through asking me open up various components , taking battery out , hard disk apart , and after 2 hours on phone could not fix it .
We love the size of the screen , although it is still lightweight and very easy to tote around .
Theres always something wrong with it , wether it be some virus you ca n't track down , or it overheats , sometimes even catches on fire , you just ca n't use it .
I like those programs better than Office and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the Office programs as well .
The computer loads in about a 1/10th of the time that my PC did , and I have all of the programs that were on my PC .
It has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer .
I managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me .
It 's great to have a solid Mac in the living room .
That was a big mistake .
Startup in about 30 seconds , shutdown in 2-4 seconds , resume from sleep in 0-2 seconds .
It doesnt overheat or make any loud noises .
I hate it !
With what I paid for this computer it should have had everything on it .
First things first , Macbook pro has many applications to make life easier , unlike the windows computers .
*** The review below is no longer relevant , Apple has fixed the issue .
The laptop was very easy to set up .
I like the laptop overall .
do a quick search on the internet see if im the only one .
Great value , fast delivery - Computer works as if brand new , no problems , very pleased
Upgrading from Windows 7 Starter , thru Windows 7 Home Premium , to Windows 7 Professional was a snap ;
The reality was , it heated up very quickly , and took way too long to do simple things , like opening my Documents folder .
My MacBook is probably the best investment I have ever made .
I called Toshiba where I gave them the serial number and they informed me that they were having issues with the mother boards .
the mouse jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i dont want it too .
It would take up too much time to do reaearch for my papers and I would be up hours-just because the computer was too slow .
If you already own a 2009 , 2010 , or early 2011 model , you should wait until the next update .
I can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner .
Typically , when I purchase a new laptop I always end up using an external mouse for convenience .
Very fast and efficient !
The Material this Pro is made out of seems a lot nicer than any PC Specs : Like I said this performs a lot better than any computer I 've had in the past .
Yeah , it 's super expensive .
for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is .
so i called technical support .
It is everything I 'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint , but somehow a bit more sturdy .
I bought it to be able to dedicate a small , portable laptop to my writing and was surprised to learn that I needed to buy a word processing program to do so .
A cheaper price should not equal a " cheap " product .
No laptop is perfect , but sometimes you just find a computer that works for you .
Took a while to clean it up to my specs .
I was very excited because this was my first personal computer and I was purchasing it with my OWN money I had recieved from graduation presents .
On 3 July 2004 , I purcased this model at Best Buy for about $ 150
The only problem is a lack of screen resolutions !
they improved nothing else such as Resolution , appearance , cooling system , graphics card , etc .
I have a laptop as my regular computer , but found that disconnecting it and lugging it around was a drag .
Works well , and I am extremely happy to be back to an apple OS .
I also purchased Office Max 's " Max Assurance " with the " no lemon " clause .
I would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express .
I was starting to boil .
Having USB3 is why I bought this Mini .
I love it so much .
They replaced it and so far so good .
lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small .
Seems a much more economical way to get into Apple than their other computers .
They need to stop outsoucing and send some complaint calls to US based customer service agents for those who live in the United states .
After about a week I finally got it back and was told that the motherboard had failed and so they installed a new motherboard .
Files as well would become lost , deleted or corrupted .
I think part of the problem with this computer is Vista , yet I know Vista is n't the entire issue because my latest purchase was my Acer and it also has Vista ( I should have waited the few months to get the next operating system ) .
the features are great , the only thing it needs is better speakers .
The specs are pretty good too .
They transfer you around to other people who do not understand what you are saying and you ca n't understand what they are saying .
Everything about this computer is easy to use .
There is no cd drive on the computer , which defeats the purpose of keeping files on a cd .
I could save ten essay papers and have hardly any memory left .
So , the hard disk capacity really does n't matter to me .
It is BLAZING fast !
I bought this laptop on Saturday and am completely in love with it !
THE FIRST PROBLEM IS THAT THE KEYBOARD FUNCTION IS SIMPLY UNSATISFACTORY .
I did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements , but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before I purchased .
Simple details , crafted aluminium and real glass make this laptop blow away the other plastic ridden , bulky sticker filled laptops .
It 's a great product for a great price !
If you really want a bang-up system and do n't need to run Windows applications , go with an Apple ;
My son said it popped up and he clicked update .
OSX Lion is a great performer . . extremely fast and reliable .
This computer had exactly the specifications I needed .
The sound is nice and loud ; I do n't have any problems with hearing anything .
One drawback , I wish the keys were backlit .
I do transcription work on the side , and the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well .
This is why I purchased a BRAND NEW LAPTOP in the first place so it would n't have ANY problems .
Also , because of the size and consistancy of the laptop computer , some websites would n't even attempt to work on the computer because of browser problems .
With the softwares supporting the use of other OS makes it much better .
First , it does not have a push button to open the lid .
Thank you for your great product !
2nd Mac book I have purchased from MacConnection .
The service tech said he had tried to duplicate the damage and was n't able to recreate it therefore it had to be their defect .
Only a few days after I received the computer back , the screen froze again .
This is my first Dell I heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it !
I would like to tell you about the best laptop I just got from Mac .
The delivery was fast , and I would not hesitate to purchase this laptop again .
Of course , I also have several great software packages that came for free including iWork , GarageBand , and iMovie .
So , I thought why not give Mac Book pro a try .
USB3 Peripherals are noticably less expensive than the ThunderBolt ones .
The built quality is really good , I was so Happy and excited about this Product .
I dislike the quality and the placement of the speakers .
I have no problems yet on my mac so far , and hope it stays like that .
I had to get Apple Customer Support to correct the problem .
I have had at least eight Toshiba laptops , and they have been outstanding , including this one .
Fine if you have a touch screen .
The programs that come standard with the Leopard running system are enough for the average person to run all the basics .
i would never go back any more , i love this computer so much and i would recommend it to everyone .
It is always reliable , never bugged and responds well .
I have to wonder why Amazon is even selling this dinosaur .
company provides UPS shipping , fast , great !
I Have a friend who has the other model and we put them side by side with the same dvd in ( battle of the Smithsonian ) After on Hour mine was at 53 % life left and his was at 69 % life left .
However , the experience was great since the OS does not become unstable and the application will simply shutdown and reopen .
! Excelent performance , usability , presentation and time response .
When I got it , I immediately noticed that it was quite heavy and thick and not really attractive .
i can use it for all of my needs .
Sure , the initial out of pocket expense is greater , but that should not dissuade anyone from the fact that these machines run like none other on the planet , and when I factor in all the money in that I wasted on Geek Squad and the latest patches to de-corrupt my infested PCs , it probably comes out about even anyhow .
I would Highly recommend this MacBook .
Yes , a Mac is much more money than the average laptop out there , but there is no comparison in style , speed and just cool factor .
But , for the cost this is a winner .
Also it is very good for college students who just need a reliable , easy to use computer .
The biggest problem is that the box had no instructions in it .
I like to use it at the race track to handiecap the horse races .
The newer black keyboard took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick , but it is still a great notebook !
All I can say is W-O-W .
So you do n't get frustrated the first few weeks .
" This is n't a big deal , I have n't noticed the issue with DVDs or other media , only through USB output .
STOPPED BOOTING UP less than a week after my one-year warranty was up .
although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks .
Yes , he is a self professed " Mac snob .
:) Great product , great price , great delivery , and great service .
I saw walmart had the same computer for about $ 650 but still knowing what I know now , I would not buy it at that price .
And that probably explains why I 've already had my SATA controller go bad within a year of buying it .
Other Thoughts : I love newegg , I recommend them to the world however this is just unacceptable .
The sheer power and flexibility makes the MacBook Pro a must have for any techie !
I like iTunes , the apparent security , the Mini form factor , all the nice graphics stuff .
It gives me the power and speed that I need to run all the programs I use to edit .
Not to mention the fact that your mac comes fully loaded with all necessary basic programs .
With in weeks of purchasing my computer is began to slow down .
A lot of features and shortcuts on the MBP that I was never exposed to on a normal PC .
Windows is also rather unsteady on its feet and is susceptible to many bugs .
The investment of a new MacBook Pro came at a price , but totally worth it for a good piece of mind .
Good monitor and performed well .
All of them were Windows machines .
Being a PC user for many years to switch to a Mac I will not go back .
not using wired lan not sure what thats about .
They discovered the manufacturer 's defect and sent it in for repair .
The people there just changed for me on the spot and I got a new arm piece and they did n't even request for a receipt .
Granted , it 's still a very new laptop but in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops , my Mac boots up noticeably quicker .
Set up was easy .
The technical service for dell is so 3rd world it might as well not even bother .
so when I had the money to buy one I bought other things instead .... a 700 laptop and some extra stuff with it .
apple is one of the best computer companies in the country .
Not working = bad
IT IS TRASH !
It 's ok but does n't have a disk drive which I did n't know until after I bought it .
So not having my laptop was discouraging .
Crisp screen , great battery life , and plenty of storage .
The sound as mentioned earlier is n't the best , but it can be solved with headphones .
You can call HP and they want you to buy more software to fix it .
Tried to make a recovey disk wouldnt get passed the first recovery disk .
I 've installed to it additional SSD and 16Gb RAM .
it has times were it freezes for 10 seconds and then starts again .
Amazing Quality !
seriously why have n't they just replaced it by now .
Overall it 's an amazing product , 5 stars !
There is hardly any memory on the computer 's hard drive .
MacBook Notebooks quickly die out because of their short battery life , as well as the many background programs that run without the user 's knowlede .
The speed gives you the power to work on these projects seamlessly , and multiple at a time if you sowish .
What a great little laptop .
After 5 months of failed repairs , requested a full refund but was refused and it still is not repaired and Acer is indifferent to the issue .
Got this Mac Mini with OS X Mountain Lion for my wife .
It seems they could have updated XP and done without creating Vista .
The battery life is excellent - 6-7 hours without charging .
Apple is unmatched in product quality , aesthetics , craftmanship , and customer service .
It is also very lightweight , making transporting this computer very easy .
Sure it has the one touch keys but that was the best feature of the computer .
No complaints for an Apple product .
Apparently well-built and gorgeous to look at , the i5 MacBook Pro is a winning combination of price and performance .
" For one , I noticed that from turning on my mac to logging on only took about 25 seconds .
I always use a backup hard disk to store important files at all times .
i would really recommend to any person out there to get this laptop cause its really worth it .
I never have had a good result with this computer .
I 've already recommended this laptop to a friend who eye 'd the computer when I took it out of my bag .
Went silently .
It does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern .
The only thing that can be updated is the video , other than that you 're all set .
Again .
The speed is incredible and I am more than satisfied .
Enjoy that Toshib force and durability unparalleled
This is great if you have several lectures back to back and do n't have a chance to charge during one of the lectures .
The battery life seems to be very good , and have had no issues with it .
My friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance , picture quality , and ease of use .
I love it !
It is really thick around the battery .
I investigated netbooks and saw the Toshiba NB305-N410BL .
breaks easily .
Look up recipes and keep it on the kitchen counter while I cook .
My last computer , a Toshiba , cost only $ 400 , and worked like a charm for many years .
My daughter uses it for games , email , facebook , pictures and music .
I initially purchased my Macbook Pro 13 " in April , and I loved it .
The apple care has never failed me , and I expect it to be the same for this computer as well .
But the performance of Mac Mini is a huge disappointment .
I can throw anything at it ( and I do ) , Pictures , video editing , schoolwork .
I tried several monitors and several HDMI cables and this was the case each time .
I bought my Acer Aspire custom made in June 2008 .
Best money I ever spent .
It lasted for many years of travel , kids and abuse and if I fired it up today , it would work .
Newegg 's RMA service was great as always , I contacted them late Friday night , and they issued me an RMA number and a PrePaid UPS shipping label the very next morning on Saturday .
I chose the iBookG4 , a laptop that is an attractive computer with a large screen big enough to please anyone .
It still serves me well both in business and home needs .
All apple associates are always wiling to help you out with anything , no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed .
I guess the only good thing that came out of these were the speakers and the subwoofer .
I never tried any external mics with that iMac .
The other lock-up problems are from a myriad of causes , the most common being a corrupted version of Appleworks which can render the browser useless .
1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in .
I think that if it is the motherboard again so soon that they should replace it .
It 's software and speed enable it to do amazing things .
After paying over $ 1000 for this computer , it was not worth it .
I have had a black macbook since 2007 .
I could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage .
Ive had to call tech support many times .
That includes transferring my music and movies .
Long story , but after many calls to various offices , I was told that no one can override the depot and that managers do n't take phone calls or e/mails .
It was definelty a smart move .
However , a NETBOOK will be a different story .
I can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly .
I bought it to my son who uses it for graphic design .
The receiver was full of superlatives for the quality and performance .
I 've had friends with Acers who seem to have had similar or exact same problems .
I respond that I do not have the old computer ...
One of the wonderful things about Macs is that they are virus free .
It is in the best condition and has a really high quality .
It 's not a recommendation , it ' a plea .
Overall : Poor , Features : Average , Performance : Poor , Battery Life : Excellent , Price-Value : Poor
power supply went bad after 2 weeks --
Battery life could be better but overall for the price and Toshiba 's reputation for laptops it 's great !
I am a college student and it has been very useful .
Far superior to my MacBook .
There are so many things wrong with this product , it just makes me want to set my self on fire !
I love how easy every thing is to do on my Apple products .
Take the simple , easy solution to your computer problems and stop waiting and smacking your old computer around .
First off , I really do like my MBP ... once used to the OS it is pretty easy to get around , and the overall build is great ... eg the keyboard is one of the best to type on .
It is more than enough computer to keep up with the needs of a high school student .
It is stamped and not in pieces therefore it is a stronger more resilient frame .
The new MBP offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months .
The only thing I do n't understand is that the resolution of the screen is n't high enough for some pages , such as Yahoo!Mail .
I am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great !
Spent 2 hours on phone with HP Technical Support .
I wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month .
Pretty much made sense to get a Mini .
Supplied software : The software that comes with this machine is greatly welcomed compared to what Windows comes with .
So happy with this purchase , I just wish it came with Microsoft Word .
No installation disk ( DVD ) is included .
The cool thing about this is anyone can use it .
The processor is very quick and effective as I load webpages and applications .
Great wifi too .
I 'm using this computer for word processing , web browsing , some gaming , and I 'm learning programming .
If you want a little more custom ability , drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of Win 7 and grab a 2GB stick of memory to spice it all up a bit more .
Again - windows based machines were not giving me anything to work with !
Aside from the trial software and the short battery life , lack of a webcam , its great .
Even though I could have gotten a pc twice the speed for the same price I still think there 's nothing like a Mac .
This can be annoying at first but you just have to train yourself not to to start over so far .
Finally , I could n't take it anymore and ordered my Apple .
The battery life was shorter than expected .
It 's applications are terrific , including the replacements for Microsoft office .
That defeated the whole point of a laptop .
I received this laptop as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst .
There is no need to purchase virus protection for Mac , which saves me a lot of time and money .
Wonderful sleek case design is only on the outside .
Enough said .
If you could stretch by a few 100 dollars I highly recommend you should replace your Windows laptop with this one .
The video chat is the only thing that is iffy about it but im sure once they unpdate the next version on the macbook book the quality of it will be better .
The new Macbook Pro 15 inch i7 is nothing short of amazing .
I had to install Mountain Lion and it took a good two hours .
the key bindings take a little getting used to , but have loved the Macbook Pro .
I hope this review helps .
i use my mac all the time , i love the software , the way it takes a short time to load things , how easy it is to use and most of all how you do n't have to worry about viruses .
the touch pad is fine - again , it 's a real touch pad .
Seems like maybe a bad shipment from Toshiba .
Returned laptop for repair a 2nd time and it came back with obvious physical damage ( keyboard bulging and speaker grill pressed in ) , buttons not working and USB ports inoperative .
They freeze all the time .
big mistake !
I have only had PCs with Windows before so this takes a little getting use to .
This laptop is the most amazing little peice of machinery I have owned outside of the Iphone .
tech support would not fix the problem unless I bought your plan for $ 150 plus .
The Mac Mini is probably the simplest example of compact computing out there .
A little pricey but it is well , well worth it .
I have never had to shut down the computer unexpectedly and the computer has never froze on me .
So if anyones looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name TOSHIBA on it ...
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse .
Wasted me at least 8 hours of installation time .
After having two PC laptops die with in the past 3 years , I was led to the Apple display at Best Buy by the sleek design and promise of less tech issues .
Being only 2 months old , I am not a happy camper !
Besides the great look , it is a great machine .
This is the first time for me to use a Mac and I 'm really happy with the move .
* 6th week * - They are not responding to my emails asking when they expect to dispatch the new unit ...
It discharges too quickly .
Wonderful zooming .
HP Pavilion DV9000 Notebook PC When I first got this computer , it really rocked .
I purchased this laptop 9 months ago !
Do n't waste their money , save it and but a mac .
The laptop is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the Windows 7 starter and not the full Windows 7 .
The video card is great for media , and above average for gaming , but not a gamers first choice .
I 'm really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer .
The Genius at the Apple store advised me that there was nothing about my use of the computer that caused this failure .
So , buyers beware !
Anyone who is considering buying an Acer computer of any sort , I seriously suggest you look into buying a different brand .
Came with iPhoto and garage band already loaded .
My MacBook Pro has been a huge disappointment .
Tech support tells me the latter problem is a power supply problem and have offered to fix it if it happens again .
I can have both OSX and Windows XP running at the same time !
By this time I was regretting ever SEEING this machine on the shelf !
Temperatures on the outside were alright but i did not track in Core Processing Unit temperatures .
The tech store I purchased this from sent it back , , , , , eventually I got a new or repaired machine approximately 3 weeks later .
I would say that 85 % of the design industry is Mac for good reason .
The Apple will run Internet Explorer , but at an amazingly slow rate .
This is an over-sized , 18-inch laptop .
But I do NOT like Win8 .
overall i would recomend this to anybody and tell them that if they want to burn their music or play there video games to buy the cd drive .
it was a tough choice .
Trashed it when I spilled a latte on it while writing at a cafe .
Being a PC user my whole life ....
Again I sent it back and they replaced the motherboard and some fan inside .
They are n't worth the money , even though they are on the cheap side , laptop speaking .
The battery life is probably an hour at best .
3 weeks went by and the computer keeps crashing and will not open any applications .
I will definitely be getting a new laptop if it has any more issues after the warranty expires and researching carefully when I do so I do n't run accross a situation like this again !
Then , within 5 months , the charger crapped out on me .
Hard disk - The new editions gives you more hard disk space ( 500GB instead of 320GB ) but time has taught me never to trust an internal hard disk .
I got my MacBook Pro because I wanted to do all the stuff I need to do without worrying about the system quitting on me or freezing for a few minutes .
I had upgraded my old MacBook to Lion , so I kind of knew what I was getting , but had n't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features .
I 've had my Macbook Pro since August 2009 .
Before I begin , I will say that I am not like a good percentage of the people that will end up writing a review on this computer - I am not an Apple fanboy .
So , I took it back to the apple store and they narcissist genius bar staff ) fixed it by resetting the fan at boot up .
The settings are not user-friendly either .
Needs Power and Mouse Cable to Plug in back instead of side , In the way of operating a mouse in small area .
The computer will constantly be getting hot and burning your leg unless you go through the hassle of taking off the entire back of it just to clean out the fan .
I like this machine because its very lightweight ...
The online tutorial videos make it super easy to learn if you have always used a PC .
We have had numerous problems with Vista , such as Adobe Flash player just quits and has to be uninstalled and then reinsalled , Internet Explore just quits and you lose whatever you were working on , also , the same Windows update has appeared on this computer since we got it and has been updated probably 400 times , the same update .
It was heavy , bulky , and hard to carry because of the size .
I spoke to 4 different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a 5th person !
Thank you Best Buy for putting my computer together and installing my first software - you guys were GREAT too !
on the bright side at least I was n't without my laptop for long this time !
With notes saying they replaced the hard drive .
The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box , all the functions works great .
Good price .
The advantages of owning ' a ' mac are numerous .
The power plug has to be connected to the power adaptor to charge the battery but wo n't stay connected .
I highly recommend this computer for students looking for a solid machine to get them through college .
I loaded windows 7 via Bootcamp and it works flawlessly !
Highly recommend for daily use .
If you get a lemon ( I have two thirds of my Macs ) , you have to send it in for repairs several times before they will replace it , even if they have numerous problems with the same version of their computers .
No I am generous calling it slow .
One , owning a mac is essentially a full production studio ( in the case of a mac book a portable version ) .
If what you need is a machine to do some surfing , email checking , word processing , and watching a movie or two , this is the machine you want .
I had to buy a wireless mouse to go with it , as I am old school and hate the pad , but knew that before I bought it , now it works great , need to get adjusted to the key board , as I am used to a bigger one and pounding .
I 'm not going to lie , I 've never really liked the Acer brand in general .
This was a great deal for a decked out MacBook Pro .
This was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped .
After 20-30 min the screen of the notebook switched off .
The apple macbook pro nothing to say butprofessionally great and outstanding .
Its not just slow on the internet , its slow in general .
Needs longer lasting battery , More than 1 to 2 Hrs .
I can see why the have soooo much money .
Because it IS a defective product .
I will stack it up against laptops that cost twice as much any day .
It was not clear that the Microsoft Student Edition that was loaded on the computer , was a six month trial .
My children wo n't even use it for their school work .
IT WANT TAKE IT , IT KEEP SAYING ERROR .
I can say that I am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied .
Do not purchase this laptop .
It has a overheating issue - nearly to the point of being dangerous .
If someone called me an Apple Fanboy ... it would make sense .
the size of has actually help me out quite a bit by me being able to fit it in an already full backpack and to use it at a resturant where the food on the table is always so space consuming .
I have full control at all times of what is going on - there is no control + alt + delete business anymore .
After the bad experience with this computer went back to compaq .
Do not buy it !
The Final Cut Pro on this laptop is so fast and easy , and I can use this to seemlessly transfer all my work to my home computer , which is also a mac .
It is the worst laptop ever
it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once .
Since I have always used Apple products , the choice of Macbook Pro was obvious .
I do n't have that additional money right now , and therefore would n't have purchased it at this time .
It doesnt work worth a damn .
I used to build my own desktops from the component parts , and recently my 7 year old Pentium 4 with HT 1 GB ram SATA desktop stopped working ( this was a rock star 7 years ago ) .
THIS IS MY SECOND MAC BOOK PRO .
i dont understand why i spent twice as much to get a laptop rather than a desktop when my lap top is completely immoble .
ASUS has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks , and I would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them .
Though you get a polite person , you often don t get a solution .
I 'm Not exagerating when I say this computer is perfect . . i It is !!
The Nortons virus scan is only for a very short time unlike others that usually are good for a year .
taking notes , research , an online class and such and did n't want to spend too much on my first machine .
It was just one problem after another for me , and that 's reason we had forked out so much money was so we would n't have anything to worry about .
What can I say .
NO STAR FOR THIS TRASH . [ ...
Very happy .
The shop will definitely push the problem to the service center .
Also is portable and reliable .
It is super fast and has outstanding graphics .
It gets stuck all of the time you use it , and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work .
it is an amazing image and it too is holding up quite nicely to little hands grabbing the back of my laptop .
So , you can imagine how unhappy I am with this item .
Again , I sent it off to Acer , by this time they were paying for me to send it to them and everything , but it was still inconvienent because of my classes and my communication with my fiance .
Fits all my personal needs .
It is the best all around Mac .
It is the best laptop ever !!!
A great computer for light home use and business use .
My power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership , so it was covered by the Applecare warranty plan .
Best thing is I can use existing 32 bit old programs .
The paint wears off easily due to the keyboard being farther back than usual .
I previously owned an older Dell laptop that died after about 5 or 6 years .
Theres a built in camera with special effects - for video and photography .
All the programs are easy and straight forward on my MacBook Pro , it is clean and organized , which I always strive to be myself .
I thought the price was great for the specs .
Very happy with my 7th Toshiba laptop !
I love this product because it is Toshiba and its 15.6 " .
Many of my classmates computers hard drives crashed .
Everything was so easy .
I Hate it !
I bought the netbook because it was smaller and lighter for me to carry around .
I just got this laptop for college , and so far I am very happy with it .
this is starting off good .
99 to fix it .
Many people complain about the new OS , and it 's urgent for Apple to fix it asap !
So you might ask , what did Apple do for me ?
Hopefully Amazon will take this back .
I loved the netbook ( minus the fact that it was windows OS ) until this started happening .
And as for all the fancy finger swipes -- I just gave up and attached a mouse .
I have owned many different brands of laptops in my life .
It will be returned in the state to which it was shipped Michigan .
My bag just got a little lighter .
Great laptop for school , easy to use for beginners in the household .
It was very easy to just pick up and use -- It did not take long to get used to the Mac OS .
Boot time is super fast , around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute .
No machine has come remotely close to causing as many problems .
If you do n't feel comfortable doing it yourself , just buy the case and be happy , plus it looks nice , I bought the white one from Best Buy .
PDF files can be viewed instantly .
Going to bring it to service today .
Not too much " junk " software to remove .
I 'm having the laptop returned unrepaired since paying $ 176 every 3 months just is n't worth it ( that 's about how long the port seems to last ) .
I am just amazed .
First it burned or fused the power adapter plug .
I needed a laptop with big storage , a nice screen and fast so I can photoshop without any problem .
Bigger HD , better graphics card , and a bid HD .
It is not an easy decision to purchase a used or even good as new laptop but I am very satisfied .
I have had laptops in the past and I thought why not give these small netbooks a try .
Microsoft seems to be unable to keep up with repairs for the multitude of windows problems .
Which it did not have , only 3 USB 2 ports .
It is pretty snappy and starts up in about 30 seconds which is good enough for me .
I realize that not every unit has this issue , but the ones that do can not be repaired .
Now I know !
I was not aware that this product can not display websites that contain Flash .
My friend just had to replace his entire motherboard , so did my wife , and it looks like I will have to as well .
The item received was exactly as identified .
MS Office 2011 for Mac is wonderful , well worth it .
You ca n't even get a satellite card which is why I bought to begin with .
Maybe it 's Acer , maybe it 's MSFT .
the internet can be an scary place its up to you on what you do with it .
It suddenly can not work .
Okay , let 's just start out by saying I am in no way a computer techy .
After all was said and done , I essentially used that $ 450 savings to buy 16GB of RAM , TWO Seagate Momentus XT hybrid drives and an OWC upgrade kit to install the second hard drive .
Took the netbook on a vacation trip and I was able to do whatever I wanted to do without lugging a much heavier laptop .
I started hainv problems with it within the first month .
It was a bad experience but i played down its importance .
I would buy this lap top over and over again !
Its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my laptop .
The best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once , it never slows down .
It could n't have been a better decision .
Out of the box I noticed how small it was and was exactly what I was looking for .
No viruses .
The only thing I miss is that my old Alienware laptop had backlit keys .
The # 1 reason that is always repeated .
I was told by many that it was a great computer , but we got one of these , and it worked great for one year , and as soon as the warrenty was up , then it got really bad .
First the screen goes completely out .
It provides much more flexibility for connectivity .
YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET FOR .
they will not let you down .
If you 're not wanting to be mobile , this is a good laptop to sit on a desk .
Does exactly what I bought it 4 .
Not even safe mode boots .
It certainly does , but you rarely hear any of your friends with Mac 's complain about anything .
I will NEVER buy ( Refurbished ) again , I do n't cae how cheap it is .
Will not buy another Toshiba , this is my second , not happy w / either .
I was ready to take it back for a refund , but the Geek Squad camed through and pointed me in the right direction to get it fixed .
Apparently there is a manufacturing defect , something with the amount of thermal paste .
The only thing that is n't perfect about this netbook is the speakers , they are not loud at all but I expected that .
It was fast , and it was " different " .
( I definatly ca n't ) .
This is my second MacBook .
Also , the battery does not last very long at all .
It is very durable , I am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet .
My husband uses it mostly for games , email and music .
Everything is falling apart internally and externally .
Drivers updated ok but the BIOS update froze the system up and the computer shut down .
As of a couple weeks ago the middle portion of the laptop from top to bottom , , , about 4 inches across is hardly visible .
I highly recommend this product !
I am now frustrated that I still have to use my work issued Windows laptop !
This is something i would deffinately reccomend to someone .
This laptop rocks ( only wish it could run SolidWorks CAD - which Apple does n't support ) !
Our Apple 13.3 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer ( Z0J80001 ) Notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking .
We upgraded the memory to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace increase in speed .
The graphics on this computer are also stellar - very clear and vivid .
Posted Nov 8 , 2010 - Two weeks ago I bought this notebook .
Now , , , , , my monitor has been acting up for about 2 months .
The only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets , and rather quickly too .
Just beware no DVD slot so when I went to install software I had on CD I could n't .
And Toshiba is a quality supplier .
This computer is exceptionally thin for it 's screen size and processing power .
I took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one .
It 's fun to take to a bookstore , sit in the coffee shop area , sign in to WiFi and look up book reviews of books I might buy .
Originally bought it for my wife .
I 've had the MacBook Pro 15 for about three weeks , and it really is a great computer .
The perfect notebook ...
I am not much of a computer techie , so I can understand some of the internal problems , though I do have trend micro as an antiviral program .
Where you click and hold and drag it picture , link , etc to where you want it .
They have more problems then a 1980 's computer .
: - ) If you buy this - do n't go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life , and you 'll be perfectly satisfied .
AND the best part is that it even comes with a free printer ( when they have a certain promotion/offer going , of course ) !
The processor went on me , the fan went and the motherboard went .
Quietest laptop I have ever owned .
This system is not worth the money or trouble trying to get it fix .
I upgraded the memory and replaced the base Windows 7 Starter to Win 7 Home , and it runs just fine .
I purchased an HP right after my high school graduation .
The apple systems are over priced luxurys that ar n't worth what they are being charged for , this model 's specifications are far from being impressive and they only thing you get out of this is the apple name .
Second , it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated
It easily fits into most computer bags but does n't weigh down a backpack or satchel when being carried with spirals and/or textbooks .
Yes , I thought the expese was a little much , but I now realize you get what you pay for .
This purchase opened me to the world of Macbooks , and I am impressed with the intuition of the design , the beauty of the product , and the excellent technological advances associated with it .
The Like New condition of the iMac MC309LL/A on Amazon is at $ 900 + level only , and it is a Quad-Core 2.5 GHz CPU ( similar to the $ 799 Mini ) , with Radeon HD 6750M 512MB graphic card ( this mini is integrated Intel 4000 card ) , and it even comes with wireless Apple Keyboard and Mouse , all put together in neat and nice package .
I would n't play a first-person shooter with this , mind , but if you wanted to run MS Office , email , chat , download a video , listen to music from a certain fruit-named music store , and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in , I 'd highly recommend checking this out .
It crashes , and when it goes flat , it just DIES ( like a PC , maybe worse ) and I loose all my open documents !
Gradually the freezing screen evolved into a screen that froze in weird shapes .
The SD card reader is slightly recessed and upside down ( the nail slot on the card can not be accessed ) , if this was a self ejecting slot this would not be an issue , but its not .
If you shop around in the current market you can find a much better deal .
I should have been more observant .
I previously purchased a 13 " macbook ( had pro specs and was aluminum style ) which had a nvidia 9800 ( If I am not mistaken ) and it had major heating issues .
Summary : I 've had this laptop for 2 months , out of the blue the power adapter stops working .
Looks nice , but has a horribly cheap feel .
Not a scratch or mark on it .
It 's a nice little gadget .
After paying several hundred dollars for this service , it is frustrating that you can not get help after hours .
This is my first LG product .
With awesome graphics and assuring security , it 's perfect !
It came alot faster than I thought it would have which was really exciting .
It is easy to use , good quality and good price .
i have had my dell latitude for almost three years .
THIS is what a laptop is supposed to be .
So glad I have gone this route !!
I have nothing to regret from this new product .
In summary , take your money elsewhere .
Much faster than my old windows laptop that died on me .
Also kinda loud when the fan was running .
The 2.9 ghz dual-core i7 chip really out does itself .
