Quick and has built in virus control .
Ca n't wait until I go on vacation and take it with me .
I called Toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem .
What 's also interesting is this survey changed my ratings the first time I submitted it in case it does n't keep what I put here are my aratings
The battery life is also relatively good .
Laptop is to be used like a Netbook .
This is the first laptop I 've owned , althougth I used several at my previous job .
While we struggle with all the crashes and viruses , the kids computers stay consistent and so we caved in and bought one for buisness !
This ai n't it .
I 've only had mine a day but I 'm already used to it ...
I love everything about it .
Consumer Report recommended Toshiba .
Bottom line , if you can afford it , get a Mac !
Came fully loaded - good .
The MAC Mini , wireless keyboard / mouse and a HDMI cable is all I need to get some real work done .
That is how it is able to function better than any other PC .
Not a bad laptop , it 's a bit slow , but gets the job done .
i must keep it plugged in at all times because it will not keep a charge for longer than four minutes .
Much of which HP ended up paying for .
Its everything mac offers .
The configuration is perfect for my needs .
To this day , there are NONE .
Unfortunately , the laptop I purchased was also a Dell and again , I have to say i hated it .
A tip for people looking into this computer : DO NOT BUY IT save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last .
It was truly a great computer costing less than one thousand bucks before tax .
They were great in handling this problem , and I 'm looking forward in purchasing additonal products from them in the future .
Other Thoughts : Do not purchase this product .
I went right out and purchased another laptop .
But with this laptop , the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sounding tinny .
I do not know for sure .
- They reported that the computer is in their headquarters .
Unable to boot up this brand new laptop .
It 's a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them .
My Iphone synced right up just like a person would expect , unlike the PCs in our lives .
I returned it to Best Buy on the ninteenth of April .
Memory is upgradable .
Oh my goodness-I am not a happy camper .
I have a business website and every time I have to change something I have to go to the public library to use a PC .
Battery life needs more life .
Probably as good as you can get in a netbook , does everything I ask for and has some very good unexpected pluses .
HP said I had done the damage .
Great laptop that offers many great features !
Recommended to people as their first laptop .
I dislike the weight and size , cubersome .
i tried turning it done but it did nothing .
You just can not beat the functionality of an Apple device .
It s heavy for Mac book but is good .
Windows 7 Starter is terrific ( no you ca n't change the background ) but I do n't need to , I use it just for school work .
Overall though , for the money spent it 's a great deal .
I 'm stuck w / a broken computer .
Skype is just so dang cool with this machine too .
I bought my macbook a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since .
The best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features .
very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent ...
Do your research on this issue .
Purchased as a gift for a friend .
I love the solid machined aluminum frame , and the keyboard is the best of any laptop I 've used .
It seems to be incompatible with everything else .
Another Great thing is the Beast graphics .
apple and quess what , you have to send the whole laptop in , too bad , so sad
You will not regret buying this computer !
Whenever I call Dell about an unrelated problem , they ask me if my laptop is running slowly and if I 'd like to purchase more memory for $ 75 .
I 'm still within the one year warranty but the repair " depot " has deemed that this time it was caused by physical abuse and is not covered .
I wanted it for it 's mobility and man , this little bad boy is very nice .
Its only crashed on me one time in the 3 months i 've had it .
- Apple offers to send replacement and after 10 days I send them the old computer .
This one has had the same effect .
This causes my wrist to scrape up against it .
Other Thoughts : Received replacement 16 Days later .
I had the same reasons as most PC users : the price , the overbearing restrictions of OSX and lack of support for games .
The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely .
This is a great value for the money .
Before , I reloaded with Windows 7 Ultimate and used only the downloaded drivers from Acer 's site .
They were able to set-up with labtops themselves within a few minutes .
There also seemed to be a problem with the hard disc as certain times windows loads but claims to not be able to find any drivers or files .
Good luck with your purchase options .
The thunderbolt port is awesome !
I could n't afford a new mac , so I bought a PC instead .
but it came back in even worse shape .
The AC power port becomes loose over time
This laptop has left me with a HORRIBLE taste in my mouth for Acer brand products .
When I am next to my router on my HP I get full service , on my Eee PC I get 3 bars .
Anyways I bought this two months ago and when I first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone .
So if you want a good machine that does almost anything this is the one , if you want a low budget computer then look at the other great brands Best Buy sells .
This laptop has only 2 USB ports , and they are both on the same side .
Worth the investment and truly a fine piece of equipment .
The only thing I miss are the " Home/End " type keys and other things that I grew accustomed to after so long .
From the moment I opened the box to the present it has been a great joy .
I bought it from HSN because it was " bundled " with extra software , but as it turns out , that software just crashes it more often .....
the retina display display make pictures i took years ago jaw dropping .
I decided I wanted a laptop so I went into the BBY store .
The problems started with just the screen freezing .
The computer was two weeks late in delivery because HP forgot to complete the required import paperwork .
And if you have a iphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to it at high speed .
I did n't like one thing about it .
Then to make matters worst , there is noone that they can transfer you to .
I play a lot of casual games online , and the touchpad is very responsive .
Simply amazing computer !!
Besides , the apple stocks have been falling due to lack of sales .
And , if you are going to deal with HP be careful .
It is robust , with a friendly use as all Apple products .
I have had a total of 5 different laptop from many different manufactures .
I would recommend Mac , and do , to anyone looking to buy a new computer .
The only thing that I have , is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters , would help if it was a little lighter then it is .
There is no need to open a program first and the cliick open or import .
By the time I was finally able to get a work order to get it fixed I had been without my computer for almost a week while I was an Online College Student , so it was very inconvenient and I had to send it off and be without it while it was being fixed also .
1 . You can not change your desktop background ( window 's 7 starter does NOT support that function ) .
GET THIS MACHINE
We researched and found the best price at MacConnection .
It works great and I am so happy I bought it .
Then only FOUR months later , my great MacBook pro FAILED .
Exactly as posted plus a great value .
It came before the day it supposed to which is great .
I thought the transition would be difficult at best and would take some time to fully familiarize myself with the new Mac ecosystem .
When I am at Starbucks between clients I get full bars on my HP and 1 bar on my Eee PC .
THIS HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT A HEADACHE SINCE WE PURCHASED IT .
By Air sounds more like by truck to Me .
This was my first MacBook purchase ever .
I burned my leg , after lifting it from my desk , and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table , so I can place it there .
Of course , eMachines can not be made entirely to blame for this computer 's woes ;
Quality Display I was surprised with the performance and quality of this HP Laptop .
That 's a huge difference .
I Have been a Pc user for a very long time now but I will get used to this new OS .
I did have to replace the battery once , but that was only a couple months ago and it 's been working perfect ever since .
The company sent me a whole new cord overnight and apologized .
I had to call Apple 19 times ( each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone ) , and take it to their store for evaluations , and diagnostics , 5 times .
If you have to ask you do n't own a Mac and your just not in the know .
If you want more information on macs I suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications .
I am able to organize my pics , music and files easily .
After that the said it was under warranty .
The benefits were immediate !
Its ease of use and the top service from Apple - be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar - can not be beat .
The system constantly overheats , the battery life is too short , the case is coming apart , and my core applications that I use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly .
Best Buy laughed when I told them they should replace it instead of expecting me to be without a computer again for another couple of weeks .
We carry the netbook around here and there , hence it 's kinda of irritating when the LCD just " slide " downwards .
I actually contact Toshiba before I started having problem and was given run around after I supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired .
This is the first macbook I have ever had .
I was so excited to receive the Toshiba L455 as a gift/bonus for some work I had done for a friend of mine !
Despite the inconvenient weight , I opted for the 12 cell battery .
Actually , I think I was intimidated by the change from a PC .
Once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts .
I was happy with My purchase of a Toshiba Satellite L305D-S5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the Toshiba Warranty .
Just a bunch of idiots who 's English as a 5th language is forced at best .
That is pretty sad when they name them specifically .
Two , owning a 17 in.mac book gives the flexibility to sit anywhere you want without worry about bother anyone .
I would rather spend my money on a computer that costs more then a Toshiba that is n't good at all .
The track pad is a bit squirrely at times - sometimes too sensitive , and sometimes a bit unresponsive , but it 's usable .
After fumbling around with the OS I started searching the internet for a fix and found a number of forums on fixing the issue .
The screen is a little glary , and I hated the clicking buttons , but I got used to them .
It was a total Dhell experience that I will never repeat .
I just love this lap top , I just wish it were all silver or they had all black .
I paid about the same for my Toshiba as I did for the compaq a few years back .
There were no scratches or dents or any marks at all .
The cool thing about the Mac Book was that I went on my honeymoon and shot a bunch of pictures and movies with my iPhone , then I came back and put them onto my Macbook and made a pretty good DVD movie with all the pictures and videos from my trip .
While I mostly use it for email , internet and gaming , I 'm confident all other applications live up to the high standard I 've come to appreciate from Mac laptops .
Just What I Needed For Portable And My Wallet Too !
Later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months .
Typing on the keyboard becomes uncomfortable after extended use due to the sharp edges that your wrists rest on .
This MacBook is an outstanding product with great value .
I will have to say that I love my MacBook Pro !
I edit and burn to DVD a lot of video , so I obviously could not live with a non-functioning drive .
This is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design .
its not bad just VERY VERY annoying .
I am replacing the HD with a Micron SSD soon .
I have recently converted back to a mac and I could n't be happier !
Exactly that , users .
if yo like practicality this is the laptop for you .
However , the machine itself left a bit to be desired .
I did an internet search and this is a very common problem with this laptop .
The battery is really long .
I bought this notebook and only had it for 3 months If it is overload with updates the BOOT MGR .
Support has been lackluster and now I just want a refund .
Enough said .
This computer I used daily nice compact design .
This system came loaded with Windows 7 Starter .
ANd I babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke .
Graphics are much improved .
The old unibody macbook pro could fry an egg after a while .
I feel that it was poorly put together , because once in a while different plastic pieces would come off of it .
Mostly I love the drag and drop feature .
I love the keyboard .
I my wife is also now the proud owner of a Macbook as well !
The only pro to this computer is it was under $ 600 !
If you 're looking for something to fly through those massive spreadsheets or play a graphics-intensive game , you 'd be better off getting a machine aimed at that segment of the market .
At least those computers did n't just die on me like this one .
I wanted something that had a new Intel Core processors and HDMI port so that we could hook it up directly to our TV .
Overall a nice computer .
- Computer crashed frequently and battery life decreased very quickly .
No , tey do n't even support their own bios and it " could be a problem with the bios " How can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity ??!!
LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT !
2 ) Blue screen first month
I should have sent it back to them then .
The difference is phenomenal .
I pondered very long over this decision .
But you must get the 15 inch .
The graphics are great .
it might be something deep within Windows , for I was unable to create a disk image on my hard drive .
Was not happy with one of the programs on it .
2nd Best computer in the world only one way this computer might become the best is that it needs to upgreade patches to make less easier for people to hack into
I 've tried going back to XL but there still problems .
so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop .
I bought this Mac in order to replace my old Dell laptop .
In my line of work , I often have to take work home , and this makes it so easy .
Now the screen is going darker , darker , darker .
Not sure how I recommend it for quality gaming , as I have a desktop rig for that reason .
Now they are believers in the product .
The speed , the simplicity , the design . . it is lightyears ahead of any PC I have ever owned .
However , If I sound enthusiastic about this , I am !
I am loving the fast performance also .
it 's just a great toy to have around .
Never been hacked .
It is not even a year old yet , so I would definitely not recommend it to anyone .
I like the design and ease of use with the keyboard , plenty of ports .
Since I 've had this computer I 've only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth .
The lcd screen stopped working on mine after 10 months .
No temporary replacement , they are out of replacements because " many computers had problems with the Nvidia chipset " - Inquired status of repair .
I charge it at night and skip taking the cord with me because of the good battery life .
TOSHIBA WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THIS PROBLEM .
Not enough time for me to give it 5 stars !
10 hours of battery life is really something else ....
I especially like the backlit keyboard .
The price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop .
If only Bill Gates would read some of what is said here MS would do a better job .
They click .
the only problem is that i had to add 1 gb RAM , the computer was kinda slow .
I would have given it 5 starts was it not for the fact that it had Windows 8
It has been plagued with problems since the day i turned it on .
I 'm glad I made the choice to switch and buy this MAC .
The cons are more annoyances that can be lived with .
Quite simply this is the best laptop I have ever owned .
I complain again ...
And it 's so quiet that I do n't hear it at all .
With Windows laptops a wireless mouse is an absolute must .
It has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp .
After sending out documents via email and having recipients tell me they could not open the documents or they came through as gibberish , I broke down and spent another $ 100 to get Microsoft Word for Mac .
They sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still did n't work .
See retired recently and decided that she wanted a laptop .
The pro is a great product , I wish that the 13 inch models came with the Intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge ( the edges hurt my wrists ) .
They do n't just look good ; they deliver excellent performance .
While there are occasions that my computer will freeze or will need to be manually shut down , this occurs far less frequently than on PC computers and laptops that I 've used .
The book is useless .
But while this is one big advantage ( as you may know from the company s recent commercials ) there are other things to consider before going with Apple .
I do everything on this computer - check email , facebook , shop , check blogs , write papers , listen to music , and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv .
When I called Sony the Customer Service was Great .
The dv4 boasted a faster processor , more memory , and a bigger hard drive than my old computer , plus a better quality web cam , nicer screen , and many other features .
This is a review of windows vista system .
All I can say is I am impressed .
Dismantle the whole thing ? Then it will not be a newly manufactured set like before .
However , I can refute that OSX is " FAST " .
Not to mention sometimes the whole charger unit will decide not to work entirely .
It could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have DDR5 instead of DDR3 .
Another included program that is laughable is the chess game .
All the problems I have had with PC 's are solved with a Mac : the issue of overheating-my Dell was always overheating and not working properly or simply shutting off , and the issue of viruses and contaminants-my HP completely quit working within2 years of purchasing it , with no inexpensive way of fixing it .
So this review might be a tad bit bias .
I bought this laptop so that the entire family had a computer in the living room ;
I had read online that some users were having sound problems .
This worked just fine .
But then , something goes wrong .
The Apple applications ( ex.iPhoto ) are fun , easy , and really cool to use ( unlike the competition ) !
i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus .
The Toshiba laptop I am using is easier to use than most I have tried .
this is one of the reasons I purchased it .
No startup disk was not included but that may be my fault .
Was very much worth the price i paid .
Overall I feel this netbook was poor quality , had poor performance , although it did have great battery life when it did work .
Well , I had completed the presentation in powerpoint the night before on my PC , but took the Apple to the conference .
No Viruses !
Browsing , also , was no problem for me when I used itunes ( which usually slows down my PC ) .
Currently if I use the laptop I ca n't sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs .
This hardware seems to be better than the iMac in that it is n't $ 1400 and smaller .
Biggest complaint is Windows 8 .
Hieroglyphics are quite common .
I would say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful .
I 've already upgraded o Mavericks and I am impressed with everything about this computer .
I am going to college next year and I needed a cheaper , quality computer for the goals I am trying to pursue .
Oh and if thats not bad enough it does n't come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $ 25 for two cds .
The battery holds up well , it 's built very solidly , and runs fast .
Overall very impressed , Thank you Apple and Amazon !
Sony , Acer , Dell , Packard Bell and Toshiba .
And i would recommend this to anypne looking for a new laptop .
Have not yet needed any customer support with this yet so to me that is a great thing , which is leaps and bounds ahead of PC in my opinion .
this Mac Mini does not have a built-in mic , and it would seem that its Mac OS 10.9 does not handle external microphones properly .
Oh yeah , do n't forget the expensive shipping to and from HP .
The MacBook is way too overpriced for something so simple and chaotic .
I have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied .
Luckily , Dell said they would replace my laptop with a new one , but instead I got a refund and bought a mac .
I purchased a MacBook Pro and this to replace a couple of HP units that I was using .
I love apple but unlike others That does not prevent me to not be honest about how i like it and if its good or not .
I needed a driver for my HP and they would not help me with out me paying over $ 50 for it .
The performance is awesome .
This by far beats any computer out on the market today built well , battery life AMAZING .
The reason why I choose apple MacBook because of their design and the aluminum casing .
The black model also has a very nice seamless appearance - one of the better looking notebooks I 've seen .
Now 17 months later they want ( would not say exact amount ) $ 165.00 to $ 400 to fix the machine .
It doesnt get hot like my PC , with technology always at the tip of our fingertips anytime I forget how to do something i just google it .
For the [ $ ] price ( special offer ) this is a great laptop .
When it come time for warranty service to Toshiba you do n't matter .
I love my Apple , it is quick and easy to use .
This laptop does everything I need it to very well .
and if u did .
I run Dreamweaver , Final Cut Pro 7 , Photoshop , Safari , Firefox , MSN Messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time .
Your cursor will end up all over the freaking place , , , it 's not uncommon for me to accidentally delete words , sentences , paragraphs because of this mousepad .
I love the dock where I can simply drop a file ontop of a particular program , and the program will simply open that file .
I 'll rather be out of date then spend more money on toshiba .
( Beware , their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a computer is .
I did a review on it , its awesome .
During that time , I had to send it back 3 times .
The most amazing part to me as a PC user is the startup and shutdown times - and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing .
Charger seems large for this class of computer .
I waited and waited and no laptop .
All my devises “ talk ” to each other .
Probbly the worst decision we ever made !
Waited on getting this computer , but it has been a great change .
For this purpose , it 's great .
I did not have to call the support line at all .
I claim that this has no value to me , the laptop was new anyway .
Another THREE weeks later I had my laptop back with a new mousepad , keys , and casing .
It was a hard decision for me since the MacBook Pro looked so appealing .
I would buy one of these for every person in my office if I could .
The latest and mightiest Macbook pro 17-inch was bought by my university on the 30th of June 2009 .
My sisters same laptop broke about the month later for the same reason .
You will love this macbook if you choose to buy it .
I own a Hewlett Packard laptop and I 've had man problems with it since I bought in in Feb , 201
i had to return it for a replacement .
I would suggest this product to anyone .
Whenever tried to turn it on , it would restart as soon as the BIOS launched Windows ( or Winblows , as I like ot call it ) .
Programs would crash all the time , and it turned out to be a very unstable , unreliable laptop for me .
I took 3-4 years researching brands and prices of laptops .
If you want more information on macs I suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications .
But I do n't see it as a problem .
I worked in IT retail sales before .
Games being the main issue .
They did n't even try to assist me or even offer a replacement .
wow the new macbook pro hanged as i tried to type this review .
I looked around and based off my price/features comparison from a brand I trusted I landed here .
The battery life is amazingly long at 7hrs and 5hrs if you use it .
There were small problems with Mac office .
Very nice so far .
My MacBook Pro works like a dream , it has never overheated , or even been slightly warm for that matter .
Its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action .
But , like I said before , the only reason I do n't currently have a Mac laptop is because all of their laptops are too pricey .
Then it ceased charging at all .
Processor - When compared to my 3 week old Early 2011 edition there I barely experience any difference in performance ( 2.3 GHz v/s 2.4 GHz ) .
* 3 weeks after giving the computer for repair * - Visited MacHouse Amsterdam .
the whole experiece is horrible so save up and buy a better laptop .
Acer has set me up with FREE recovery discs , when they are available since I asked .
I know that everyone thinks Macs are overpriced and overrated , but once you get past the initial expense you 'll find that they 're worth every penny ( besides , there 's always the financing plan that Best Buy offers ) .
I have owned many computers and laptops .
I ca n't say enough of how satisfied I am with their product and help aftermarket .
the laptop was really good and it goes really fast just the way i thought it would of run .
It 's fast at loading the internet .
An absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will .
dell is a decently made pc .
It made the computer much easier to use and navigate .
another satisfied customer .
Overall the computer is very easy to use , the screen is perfect , great computer , my daughter loves .
Problem fixed which is great but there went another two weeks without my laptop at school .
User friendly , fast and high tech It is amazing !
I 'm going back to DELL .
Will probably never buy a HP again .
I had static in the output , and I had to reduce the sound output quality to " FM " as opposed to the default " CD .
the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer , left right and front .
In fact , he said , about 10 % of their products fail .
you can find many laptops with the same performance and even better with lower price , but you can not find the look , easy , applications , and the experience in mac .
And it is impossible to get them back in .
It has a 10 hour battery life when you 're doing web browsing and word editing , making it perfect for the classroom or office , and in terms of gaming and movie playing it 'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours .
Summary : Dont buy HP .
Was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba ? Probably not ever again .
I have an iPhone , and iPad , so it just made sense to finish off the platform by adding the Mini .
It 's outstanding too .
I took the computer into Best Buy where I purchased it and they kept it over night to study it .
Being a PC user my whole life , it 's taking a bit of time to adapt to the OS of a Mac but I 'm finding my way around .
after trying to get some help he disconnected on me .
Runs fast and the regular layout keyboard is so much better .
One of them seems to have worked .
This is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine ;
The speakers could have been better but it was n't a deal breaker ... this is a great little laptop ... love it !
Handles all my basic media needs easily .
It played various games without problems and ran aero smoothly and flawlessly .
We purchase the Dell XPS several years ago for my home business .
They told me to reprogram the computer , and I did n't need to do that , and I lost pictures of my oldests first 2 years of her life .
My house is now 100 % Macbook .
I only wish this mac had a CD/DVD player built in .
my niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that does n't require a dedicated video card .
Im glad that it has such great features in it .
Can listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display .
I know there are way better laptops out there for the same price , and why spend money on shit when you can go out and get yourself a perfectly decent laptop that doesnt suck total monkey balls .
Very good quality and well made .
10/10 five stars would recommend .
I was sorly disapointed to discover that HP ( what I thought was a reputable company ) would n't honor the warrenty when the fan blade fell apart .
They definitely have a superior product !
As a graphic arts a retired instructor I still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art .....
I was told that it seems to be a multi - component failure .
Do you think the shop will give me a new set ?? It will NOT !
Overall , still a very nice machine .
This computer is good for 10 days then it sucks for the rest of your life .
It was about six months later when the overheating problem started again , to the point it felt like fire on the bottom of the machine !
It has surpassed all expectations and fulfilled all my needs .
Acer wo n't replace the laptop .
This is a nicely sized laptop with lots of processing power and long battery life .
Cost is more as compared to other brands .
Buy this if you like being tortured , teased , frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old Mac .
She said Wal Mart rants and raves abouy carring Dell because it 's a big name but they are a piece of garbage .
I will only buy apple laptops from now on .
The reaction of Toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter .
That day !
i needed one to be able to carry to work everyday and this one seems to fit all of the criteria .
I really do n't like it , but I am stuck .
And the warranty on this macbook pro can last up to 5 years or 1000 battery recharge cycles .
I love the feel of the key board , as well as the trackpad .
The 2 GB of RAM is plenty , able to run Windows 7 and at least 2 or 3 other programs with next to no slowdown .
The applications are also very easy to find and maneuver , much easier than any other computer I have ever owned .
After 4 days , being denied 6 times and told off once , I managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt .
* 4 weeks after giving the computer for repair * - Annoyed at MacHouse Amsterdam , decided to send complaint email to Apple .
At 16 months it started shutting off after only 5 or 10 minutes .
I spent alot of money on this product and its been a nightmare .
I 've had my MacBook Pro for three years now and still love it !
That being said after 2 weeks of owning every time I start it up now it gives me a black screen for 5-8 seconds stating pxe-e61 media test error check cable .
Screen is bright and gorgeous .
It fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and I have never had any issues with it freezing .
I am so happy to have purchased this computer .
I am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook , it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop .
This is not Best Buy 's fault .
Probably wo n't work either .
It is loaded with programs that is of no good for the average user , that makes it run way to slow .
Ideal for someone on the go or for a high school students .
I 've owned this labtop for less then two months , already the mouse button has broke .
I ca n't imagine my life without it anymore !
Also consider the MS Office apps are all trial versions , hope you have your own copies .
It was so exciting for me to unwrapp my new mac .
I took it back for a full refund .
I think the manual is somewhere on the hard drive , but I rather have a hard copy .
It 's so useable and responsive .
I wish it had a webcam though , then it would be perfect !
PC never worked right even after BIOS fixed .
The mousepad is a huge pain in the arse !
I like it !
I will also say it is much better than I expected !
Within a few hours I was using the gestures unconsciously .
I had a MacBook Notebook , and it had absolutely no protection from viruses , spyware , malware , etc .
I took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it .
I work with kids and they love making short videos on there .
It can not save the correct date and time I set .
Stay away from Envy .
without a big ol' clunky machine in my backpack , I feel like I can do programming homework anywhere .
If that is the case , then I am completely happy
This computer that I have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard functions .
Be safe buy a Sony .
the screen brightness automatically adjusts .
The Macbook Pro is extremely thin and light compared to those heavy Windows Laptop .
You will need them if you want to reload the OS ( I recommend doing if you can to start fresh and optimal ) .
three years is a decent life , but this must make it to graduation and beyond .
I asked how they would determine that since there are no scratches , dents or other signs of damage and was told that was the only way this type of damage could happen .
My next laptop will also be a Mac !
There are differences that you need to know and take time to learn .
If you have any creativity in you do yourself a favor and get a mac !
Still pretty pricey , but I 've been putting off money for a while as a little Macbook Fund , and finally got to use it .
If anything , I would only suggest using one of these laptops if only you have to .
When I turned it on , nothing .
The MBP is beautiful has many wonderful capabilities .
You might think , I am new in this game , but I am a gadget lover , and have had more than 2 dozens laptops in the past 15 years , and none gets this hot , that fast .
I was informed that I need to call some 0900 number first .
Sometimes you really have to tap the pad to get it to worki
I have used different laptops in the past and I have to rate this one way above the rest .
Do you ever think HP would do that ? NEVER !
I bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market .
This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components , and I 'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator , but I still expected better product quality for this price range .
The materials that came with the computer did not include the right # anywhere .
I love this program , it is superior to windows movie maker .
All was well .
I bought my first MacBook after seeing the product demonstrated .
In short I would never buy a Compaq again .
I had my IWORKS , Itunes , Email , MS Office , network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour .
The computer would not ever cut back on .
It does n't bother me though .
Its also FUN to use !
it is of high quality , has a killer GUI , is extremely stable , is highly expandable , is bundled with lots of very good applications , is easy to use , and is absolutely gorgeous .
The only downfall is the volume control .
On two occasions the computer s calendar told me it was 1969 .
The best thing to do is build your own computer , but if u ca n't company 's like dell who allow you to choose the components are better and for the same price you can get a computer who compares to one of apple $ 2000 systems and if you google " dell coupons " you can find codes that take a signifant amount off the price .
Please , anyone who is considering getting this computer , stop .
I have always wanted a MacBook Pro ..... always !
I was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing , I took it for granted that these features were standard .
The on/off switch is a bit obscure in the rear corner .
Great pick for portability and affordability .
It is SO much fun to play with .
The price and features more than met my needs .
I agree with the previous comment that ASUS TECH SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE WHICH IS A CON IN MY OPINION .
I will never complain about the price since I believe you get what you pay for and my MacBook Pro was worth every dollar .
It is really easy to use and it is quick to start up .
I am just ONE of the million customers .
First of all , I 've been Dell fan for more than fifteen years .
Not super light but still a good one .
I was given a Mac as a birthday present and could n't be happier with it 3 years later .
Bought it to use mostly for oline classes .
Awesome laptop and the perfect size to carry around in college .
I believe this is because I was more active than the average user , meaning I average about three " tabs " .
I paid for a new laptop , but was sent a used one .
When my Dell laptop gave up only after 2 1/2 years , I decided to buy MacBook Pro .
Then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running .
Everything about the Mac is not only visually appealing , but very easy to use .
People know what they are talking about and they have pride in the product that they are selling .
Words can not express how much I love my new Mac .
also it is light weight compared to others .
It took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back .
Who knows what will happen later on when they dismantle the whole damn thing ? So , I said I wanted a new set .
I got the new adapter and there was no change .
Lord HAVE MERCY !
It 's also very capable of doing moderate video editing ( although you may need the performance boost of the larger MacBook Pros for heavy duty mobile video editing ) .
Trying to balance all of my roles leaves very little time for me to do anything , so I want to manage my time I do have to be the most efficient .
The screen takes some getting use to , because it is smaller than the laptop .
Keyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel .
Good computer and fast .
This laptop is very large and barely fits in any carrying cases .
I went with him and we picked this one .
EVENTUALLY we pushed hard enough to convince them that this was the MACHINE that was causing the problems .
I am a freelance graphic artist .
/ awesome cooling system / much better grafics card ( ATI 5870 ) / 8GB RAM / LED backlit screen ...
Other ports include FireWire 800 , Gigabit Ethernet , MagSafe port , Microphone jack .
In early May I got it back and this time I only had it back for 1 day before it had a NEW issue so it was sent back in for the 6th time they " expedited " the repairs so I was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed , by a " Senior Tech " .
I do n't really have a complaint .
The screen is nice , side view angles are pretty good .
The touchpad is extremely sensitive , which is the only drawback .
I will be patient for few months .
even though I had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty .
the only thing that bums me out about this purchase is they released a newer updated mbp seriously RIGHT after i bought this one .
The buttons you have to press a little harder than most .
I finally own a piece of computing equipment that I do n't want to take a baseball bat and destroy .
A lot of help they WERE N'T !
I 'm going to buy a logitevh c270 .
The OS is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly .
The computer continued to give me issues and in Late June it completely died again and I tried to call Acer again to get it fixed and they refused to help me , they said my warrenty was up and hung up on me .
I would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express .
I purchased this netbook after my original Toshiba laptop crashed right after the warranty expired .
I love this laptop , and use it everyday to do something , and never lets me down .
( but Office can be purchased ) IF I ever need a laptop again I am for sure purchasing another Toshiba !!
I switched to this because I wanted something different , even though I miss windows .
Then the system would many times not power down without a forced power-off .
Completely worth every single penny dime and nickel .
This is now my 3rd MacBook Pro and I really honestly love it !
This is what I call a good after sales service .
I noticed windows has a new system called Windows 7 , what about us Vista users ? They should get all the bugs out of Vista before investing in a new system .
Excellent speed for processing data .
I bought this laptop about a month ago to replace my compaq laptop .
Very nice unibody construction .
Page just disapeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something .
I bought it for college and so far it 's amazing !
That 's the downside for me .
The body is a bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up .
it has all the features that we expected and the price was good , working well so far .
My last laptop was a 17 " ASUS gaming machine , which performed admirably , but having since built my own desktop and really settling into the college life , I found myself wanting something smaller and less cumbersome , not to mention that the ASUS had been slowly developing problems ever since I bought it about 4 years ago .
I 'm excited to learn more about what this powerful machine has to offer and encourage others to do the same .
I have had a Mac for 6 years and wo n't go back to PC .
Not super fancy , but not super expensive either .
And mine had broke but I sent it in under warranty-no problems .
I fine Apple MC373LL/A 2.66 GHz 15 " Macboook Pro Notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go .
This machine was a horrible experience .
Looked at HP , ASUS , Acer , Sony and a bunch of other ones but could not find I really liked .
The machine is used , but is like new , i 'm very impress .
It should n't happen like that , I do n't have any design app open or anything .
But enough about that , I am an Apple convert for life .
When I got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct HP told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem .
Product support very poor as each phone call costs me long distan
I first purchased this Dell model " 1764 " on April 6 , 201
Also , I have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly .
We did not even have it a year .
I do n't have stupid pop up windows ( even when I have pop ups blocked ) , I do n't have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download , and best of all I can run all the web programming software I need to use all at once without slowing me down .
I 'm honestly afraid that it will burn me , it 's that hot !
If your time is worth anything to you , if you are tired of rebooting , reformatting , reinstalling , trying to find drivers , if you want a computer to work for you for a change , make the change to this computer .
I waited to review to make sure it is what it is .
Registration/1st use is easy .
Has met or exceeded my needs for a compact travel device .
Mac tutorials do help .
The screen is bright and vivid and the keyboard is very easy to use , very important for use quick typers .
( I 'm an excellent touch typist , and my hands are very sensitive , too .
returned it to walmart .
My wireless provider confirmed my home internet is fine , and any connections I turn on should work .
Not easy to carry .
Very small and portable I 've had this netbook about 12 hrs now and It 's better than expected .
my information was all lost ( my fault , I know , but I never thought I would need to back up my information on a brand new Mac , the paragon of all computers !
I have Vista , so I am unable to install and uninstall some programs .
( I had been a Windows/Linux user before this ) I love the size because the screen is big enough for what I use it for ( Internet , artwork ) , and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable .
A SECOND PROBLEM INVOLVES THE BATTERY WHICH IS ADVERTISED AS HAVING A STORAGE LIFE OF 11 HOURS BUT WHEN FULLY CHARGED SHOWS ONLY 7 HOURS OF SERVICE .
I also purchased iWork to go with it which has programs for word processing , spreadsheets , and presentations ( similar to Microsoft Office ) .
Treat yourself to a more expensive , long-lasting laptop of quality like a Sony , Apple , or Toshiba .
Easy to install also small to leave anywhere at your bedroom also very easy to configure for ADSl cable or wifi .
THIS LAPTOP WAS BAD FROM THE FIRST DAY OF USE ---- BROUGHT IT BACK TO STORE FOR RETURN OF MONEY .
Worse , for the price I could get a * netbook * that outperforms this machine .
Did n't expect to repair it at once !
It is super easy to use .
I always swore by PCs and would never consider a MAC .
I had to have these computers in my school .
It is amazing .
After replacing the spinning hard disk with an ssd drive , my mac is just flying .
I opted for the SquareTrade 3-Year Computer Accidental Protection Warranty ( $ 1500-2000 ) which also support " accidents " like drops and spills that are NOT covered by AppleCare .
The Aspire wont even boot past the Acer screen with a Droid ( I have tried both Motorola and HTC ) plugged into the USB port .
If you have much higher expectations than that ... I would look elsewhere .
I did not like my acer .
I am overall very pleased with my toshiba satellite , I like the extra features , I love the windows 7 home premium .
I love everything about this computer .
Just what the doctor ordered .
I am taking back today .
It was still working , but there was nothing on the screen .
I do n't use my laptop in a way though that needs a long battery life so it 's perfect for me .
I had it four months when my disc drive refused to open .
Second HDD cover has walls inside that need to be broken if you what to install one .
When I called Toshiba , they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $ 35 for the phone call , even though they did n't offer any technical support .
The machine itself is alright .
The fact that the screen reacts to the lighting around you is an added luxury-when you are working around others in dark areas and want privacy or do n't want to bother them with bright lighting , it is very convenient to have a darker , softer lit screen .
Have purchased many products over the years from MacConnection and this transaction , like all the others , we smoothly with no problems .
It has spent more time in repair shops than i can possibly recount here .
I like the lighted screen at night .
All of the programs ( Keynote , Pages , Numbers ) have an option to save your documents as Microsoft compatible , which really eliminates the need for the actual .
and finally i realized that mac is the best .
I love the operating system and the preloaded software .
Either way the entire thing was just a joke , a complete rip off !
after much effort and 10 days ASUS replaced itThe WiFi is very weak .
The only objection I have is that after you buy it the windows 7 system is a starter and charges for the upgrade .
It really is perfect for work and play .
I bought mine from Apple Store the day it was released as Amazon did n't have it yet .
Not to mention it has shit gigs .
Perfect for all my graphic design classes I 'm taking this year in college : - )
I had to pay for the shipping !
i have tried to charge on different batteries with no luck .
I am very Happy !
I bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her , it 's very lightweight , and the response for the computing she 's doing ( Internet focused activity : mail , research , etc. ) is excellent ;
With what I do know how to do , the computer works beautiful .
Once you go Mac , you ca n't go back !
I thought the white Mac computers looked dirty too quicly where you use the mousepad and where you place your hands when typing .
I love this computer .
I wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused , because they knew it was trouble .
$ 999.00 Tax free .
It 's perfect for everything and runs faster than an average pc !
The layout of the MacBook is horrible and confusing ;
Did n't work when shipped from Walmart.com but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop ( same make/model ) .
Comes with iMovie ;
great battery life .
It takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site , then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works .
I got the Macbook and he got a Macbook Pro .
I was disappointed when I realized that the keyboard does n't light up on this model .
The OS takes some getting used to especially after being a Windows user for so long but the learning curve is so worth it !
It runs very quiet too which is a plus .
I recommend for word processing and internet users .
It 's solid .
Then I 've fixed the DC jack ( inside the unit ) , rewired the DC jack to the OUTside of the laptop , replaced the power brick .
I am an Info Sys major in college , so I started researching this issue on my own .
Easy to customize setting and even create your own bookmarks .
It is extremely fast and very compact .
It is much faster than my desktop which is a Core2 Quad running at 2.83 GHz .
Small screen somewhat limiting but great for travel .
Got this for a graduation gift for my daughter for her to use at college .
So what if the laptops/mobile phones look chic and cool ? The after sales support is terrible .
So you out of of notebook and money .
I have had it 9 months and it is already a $ 250 loss .
The letter A stopped working after the first week .
thanks for great service and shipping !
The worst a Mac ever did to me was freeze up .
Once you get past learning how to use the poorly designed Windows 8 Set-Up you may feel frustrated .
The keyboard is too slick .
As usual at customer service center , she asked me to hold for a moment while she went to the back-office and compare it with other same model netbooks and discussed it with her colleague ( I could see them ) .
I was a little concerned about the touch pad based on reviews , but I 've found it fine to work with .
I have had nothing but problems since the day I took it out of the box !
Never any doubt I would get a MacBook , just was n't sure which one .
It 's color is even cool .
First of all , they had no record of me having the 3 year warranty I 'd paid almost $ 400 for , and I had to call in , spend hours on their online chat service , and fax in multiple documents .
It still heats up like mad and I am unable to use it with the computer directly on my lap for more than five to ten minutes at a time .
Very Very Highly Recommended .
I wanted to explore what the Mac was all about .
Beta had better quality , but VHS became the industry standard .
was debating to buy one for months , checked out different stuff on youtube , and read different articles and debates , I just didnt really wan na spend the money but Im glad that I did .
Eventually the screen went blank and the computer would not turn on .
Now I could get myself a cheap computer , that will probably work a whole lot better !
VERY disappointing :
defective software .
wonderful features .
Apparently they 're not special anymore .
I used windows XP , windows Vista , and Windows 7 extensively .
The first time I used the card reader it took half an hour and a pair of tweezers to remove the card .
The gray color was a good choice .
It 's so much easier to navigate through the operating system , to find files , and it runs a lot faster !
Back then my entire family was Devoted to the Sony name .
The computer runs extremely slowly , whether opening Word or My Computer .
This thing sucks !
Eventually my battery would n't charge , so unless I had it plugged in it would n't even power on .
Who could n't love a DVD burner , 80-gigabyte HD , and fairly new graphics chip ? As I soon discovered , though , there is a reason for which similarly-configured Sony and Toshiba machines cost more : they use higher-quality components that are faster , better-configured , and end up lasting a lot longer .
I had purchased it from a major electronics store and took it to their service department to find out what the problem was .
the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happeneing so hopefully we can get a new one very soon !
Moral of the story : - Do not buy anything from companies that do not respect their customers .
There is no HDMI receptacle , nor is there an SD card slot located anywhere on the device .
Frustrated I hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time .
returned it .
I do n't know why I did n't make the switch sooner ... o ya because it 's expensive .
Only 2 usb ports ... seems kind of ... limited .
From the build quality to the performance , everything about it has been sub-par from what I would have expected from Apple .
The repairs were made quickly though I must say , however the second time they shipped it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me .
The pictures are clear as can be .
But if you are in the computer field you probably would n't be here .
This was a significantly more affordable than getting a new MacBook Pro from Apple .
COMPUTER HAS BEEN AT SERVICE FACILITY MORE THAN IN MY HANDS .
It also comes with 4G of RAM but if you 're like me you want to max that out so I immediately put 8G of RAM in her and I 've never used a computer that performs better .
This laptop is insane !!!
and dell and best buy both refused to take it back after i only had it for 1 hour ....
It is so much easier to use
Why not 5 stars ?
The screen is bright and the keyboard is nice ;
It was okay for over a week before the blue screens started occuring again .
Every day I had this computer , something failed on it .
compresses itself and you ca n't use it .
Incredible graphics and brilliant colors .
As it turns out , I just did n't know any better .
It took so much time .
A MONTH LATER , we reinstall the OS ( Vista ) .
I went from BestBuy to Dell , Windows to Apple .
This computer is also awesome for my sons virtual home schooling .
Windows XP SP2 caused many problems on the computer , so I had to remove it .
Every single one we 've gotten we 've had problems with .
Runs very smoothly .
Graphics are clean and sharp , internet interfaces are seamless .
It has plenty of memory , lots of hard drive , and great graphics .
I tell everyone I see out looking to get this or another Toshiba .
Some problems can be fixed if you purchase new software , but there is no guarentee .
They said that my computer was covered on an extended warranty , and that products with extended warranties are taken care of through third parties and not Sony itself anymore .
But I wanted the Pro for the CD/DVD player .
Performance is much much better on the Pro , especially if you install an SSD on it .
The only issue came when I tried scanning to the mac .
Before we got this laptop , had a compaq pasaro for 5 years with no problems .
The price is great for this model , I only plan on using it for media in the entertainment room .
It is her first laptop and she is thrilled .
Screen size is perfect for portable use in any environment .
This mac is great !
I tried giving it 0 stars but I had to choose at least one , but IMO NO STARS
I paid about 18000 for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me .
and its not hard to accidentally bang it against something so i recommend getting a case to protect it .
Without a doubt , the * design * of this laptop is fantastic .
I saw the Mini Mac at Best Buy and decided to get this as my replacement .
I got tired of buying laptops and having them stop working after a year .
In all honesty , if someone is looking for a quality laptop and willing to pay a little more money for a normal sized laptop than a cheaper and less impressive laptop , then do not buy this computer .
The Mini 's body has n't changed since late 2010 - and for a good reason .
I have had the luxury ( sarcasm ) of owning 2 of these laptops .
I 've had to call Apple support to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful , english speaking ( from Vancouver ) techs that walked me through the processes to help me .
Pay attention to the specs if you want these options .
the two of us use it regularly .
They sent it off and within 2 weeks I had it back good as new .
I know that ASUS is known for making motherboards , but this is the worst computer experience that I have ever had .
I was given a demonstration of Windows 8 .
I was psyched .
But , I would recommend this product .
I bought this laptop for my son in 2007 for his Christmas present .
so we got a good deal on hsn for an ascer notebook and we bought it for him .
Can you buy any laptop that matches the quality of a MacBook ?
Other than not being a fan of click pads ( industry standard these days ) and the lousy internal speakers , it 's hard for me to find things about this notebook I do n't like , especially considering the $ 350 price tag .
I Love my new computer !
I have been very pleased with the performance of this laptop .
Was searching online for a power supply when I found this site .
I 'm the pro-active type so I went off and did some preventative fixes .
Since the machine 's slim profile is critical to me , that was a problem .
You just lose a customer .
They sent out the box right away for me to send in my computer , they paid postage and whatnot , but when I got my computer back it still was n't running right , and now my CD drive was n't reading anything !
They are simpler to use .
There is no number pad to the right of the keyboard which is a bummer .
The downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook : screen size is not something I 'd stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week .
Very annoying .
This comes in very handy for me as an educator .
I already own an iPhone , and so the move just made more sense .
From the start , when you open the box you see a completely different class of machine .
A key contributor that led me to Mac is the art aspect .
It turned out it 's not really a problem to have a Mac .
it has 3 usb ports , 1 sd memory card reader and an sd memory car expansion .
It is also fast as can be ... you get what you pay for ... well worth the investment
His was worth $ 36 .
It is known as Safari , and if you are doing any website work , you should know that many hosting companies do not support it .
So honestly , I was n't expecting anything less than perfection , and I was n't disappointed .
The only bad part is the size/weight .
System is running great .
I continued to take the computer in AGAIN and they replaced the hard drive and mother board yet again .
But the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing .
If this is an improvement in Customer Service then I would hate too see what it was before !
In the past few years , I 've had terrible experiences with HP .
The speed difference is next to NOTHING for a mac , and the hard drive can be manually upgraded or you could just buy a $ 60 500gb external hard drive .
Maybe not the cutting edge ( Satellite L455D ) but it is a workhorse .
My mac laptop is fabulous in both areas .
Its fast , easy to use and it looks great .
) only to get another " HP/Compaq " piece of crap .
Price and purpose is awesome !
NOW AM VERY APREHENSIVE ABOUT TOSHIBA LAPTOPS .
Almost 4 years ago I bought what was then the current , up to date HP Pavilion -- If I recall correctly , it was the dv 1300 t.
The only downfall is a lot of the software I have wo n't work with Mac and iWork is not worth the price of it .
I had to wait 3 weeks to get it back and it still is not working properly .
Having someone give you a quick tour of how to 's is the best .
So this is very good commputer and i highly suggest it .
I had in the past a Dell laptop and they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair technician to my house to fix it .
Very disappointed !
I am not happy with my purchase
I called their repair depot as was told they would send Me a new box to return the computer to the repair depot .
Love that it does n't take up space like a regular computer .
Yes , I have it on the highest available setting .
Of course , for a student , weight is always an issue .
I ordered my 2012 mac mini after being disappointed with spec of the new 27 " Imacs .
It is the perfect size and speed for me .
The only thing is that the battery wo n't last more than 1/2 an hour .
I got this one for thanks giving Offer for $ 962 :) .
Not too expense and has enough storage for most users and many ports .
Does everything I wanted this laptop to do .
I 'm just really happy that I waited to buy , because this thing kicks a $ $ !
Took several hours with customer support before I could even start the PC out of the box .
I tried out another Mac for a few months before buying this one and it is a great machine .
The rep did not even answer my question , I had to ask him , if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he did n't even try to acknowledge my question .
For the price and what I get out of it has exceeded my expectations .
The Apple engineers have not yet discovered the delete key .
It is easily portable and I take it everywhere I go and might require internet access .
No big deal .
I was going to buy today and noticed it went back up to $ 344.99 ?
Laptop is advertised as a 15 " but the casing looks like that of a 17 " .
Also , HDD secures inside using rails , and there is only one set on the main hard drive .
Even if you do n't do business , thats okay , it 's incredibly fast .
It was hard to handle and operate at school .
Hope this helps !
Just keep in mind the graphics is not dedicated so loading the movie almost took a minute , but it ran fairly smooth for a non-dedicated graphics card .
My first laptop was an Acer that I got for Christmas .
I 'm going back to PC .
Now , I guess , I 'll have to unload my M6809 on some poor , hapless soul .
Boot-up slowed significantly after all Windows updates were installed .
Other than that I do n't have one complaint in the world !
i am a huge computer person i love anykind of computer that works well , but when i got this one i was so happy with the way it works and how it runs its amazing .
I remind myself from time to time to take off my watch when ever I look at the small scratch that it has caused .
very very slow laptop .
Even out of warranty !
The case is carved out of a single block of aluminum .
It would n't fit in most 17-inch bags .
The Bluetooth was not there at all , and the fingerprint reader driver would be there , but the software would hang after installation was 1/2 way done .
Now , as easy as it is to use , and I do think it is a great STARTER laptop .
Another issue I have with it is the battery .
They would repair one thing , send it back and it would still have the same problem .
Everything was up and running within 15 minutes of unboxing .
The Macbook is a fantastic laptop .
I am a wife , mom and a school teacher and a college student .
The 13 " Macbook Pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to CA this is the best price we can get for a great product .
My favorite by far , although the most expensive , was my Sony .
when i first got it i thought the size of it was a joke .
After a couple of years , my battery life began to diminish but was replaced for free due to a company-wide recall of my particular battery .
I love the Mac so much better than my work PC !
Apple hit a home run here .
If you buy , pray you dont have major prolems .
A * big * upgrade from my 13 " 2006 macbook .
So , I went back .
This was an update from an early MacBook Pro .
Deal of the year .
Still have n't solved this .
We decided we would try to trade-in our old ones .
I could n't be more pleased .
It took several weeks just to get them to acknowledge that I owned the warranty .
I got the black MacBook two years ago and have never regretted it .
This computer does everything i need it to do for school and more .
I had my PC laptop for 3 years and going to a MacBook Pro is like I leaped through time .
I do n't want to RUN a computer ; I want to USE a computer .
What can I say , It 's an Apple .
if this computer every breaks down on me i will most definatly get the same one again .
- they lost my laptop for a month
Delivery was early too .
I am very happy with my first Mac .
The screen is nice and the images comes very clear , the keyboard and the fit just feels right .
We have n't had any problems with it at all .
I was loving this Netbook because it had an amazing screen and display and was small and light , but after 1 week it stopped openning web pages for me ( even after installing new browsers ) then eventually it just started giving me a blue screen and crashing everytime I booted it .
All the things you can do with the trackpad make navigating around the computer and its programs so much simpler , quicker , and easier .
So far , so good !
really no problems with the hand me down computers I received from my children .
My problem was with DELL Customer Service .
The computer was delivered as promised .
I had gotten this model for $ 1199.00 on my State 's tax-free weekend and had a $ 100 off coupon for a MacBook at the local BestBuy !
Great battery , speed , display .
I work on a PC at home and have used Pc all through college .
My hp G60-244dx died after only 16 months .
i FINALLY DID IT AND THIS MACHINE IS THE WAY TO GO !
So I called customer support ( which is good too ) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all , I just chose to hide the message .
But I was completely wrong , this computer is UNBELIEVABLE amazing and easy to use .
The large screen gives you the option to comfortably watch movies or TV shows on your computer instead of buying an additional TV for your dorm room .
The Mac Book Pro performs flawlessly .
Additionally , there is barely a ventilation system in the computer , and even the simple activity of watching videos let alone playing steam games causes the laptop to get very very hot , and in fact impossible to keep on lap .
They offer the best warranty in the business , and do n't 3rd party it out like Toshiba .
But my blog is read by my friends and search engine visitors .
The 17 inch screen is very large , but the computer is very light .
The leather carrying case , keyboard and mouse arrived in two days from Memphis warehouse .
Love the stability of the Mac software and operating system .
This laptop looks great on the surface : 17 " inch screen , good price-point , nice appearance , boots up quickly , runs fast etc .
Design : very durable .
The graphics are stunning .
I had meant to purchase the NB205 and bought this one by accident ( long story ) .
this company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this " never " happen ...
Web surfuring is smooth and seamless .
however , I may have inadvertently thrown out one of the batteries with the shipping carton .
My wife recently purchased an Apple MacBook Pro and our granddaughter fell in love with it and asked for one for her birthday .
Being a tech savvy , APPLE - product loving person , I 'm glad I finally got the MacBook Pro !
i cant believe HP put this out .
This is my 3rd Apple Laptop and first MacBook Pro .
In the three years I 've had my MacBook Pro , I have never had a virus on my computer , and I do a lot of work on the internet .
The durability of the laptop will make it worth the money .
tosiba has a good reputation , my llast computer was an acer .
I was looking for a mac which is portable and has all the features that I was looking for .
But I needed a laptop for school use .
The hard drive crashed as well , and I had to buy a new power cord .
When I took it back to Best Buy I asked them if they were seriously trying to drive me insane !
So far it has been five months since the last problem was fixed and I am PRAYING it has finally stopped .
Sure hope Best Buy will replace it asap .
it is hard to fix and makes it a hassle to own one .
Which is great I am running Vista Business and scored a 5.X on the index I have never seen a windows machine have a total score in the 5 's .
I would never tell anyone to buy one either .
Pretty disappointed about this product .
Setting would change for some reason , the screen size would change on it 's own , like the pixel sizes and whatnot .
The much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare .
It is good to know that I can mobilize without having to worry about the battery life .
I hate to say this , but if I could take this back to the shop and get my money back , then I would .
I previously owned a Toshiba and it only lasted about 2 years .
It 's also fairly easy to use the Operating System .
I can never go back to a PC now , this machine never freezes or has any problems .
It will make life so much easier next semester , just wish I had it last semester !!
Buy it , love it , and I promise you wo n't regret it .
I went from a Macbook to this Mac Mini and this was a great upgrade !
Strong build though which really adds to its durability .
The resolution on the screen is almost pure HD .
Money and time well spent !
Returning this as soon as I get out of work
I got a mac as my HS graduation gift .
I wiped nearly everything off of it , installed OpenOffice and Firefox , and I am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price .
I upgraded from a 5 year old laptop and was amazed to find out that this computer is much slower then my old laptop .
But , buy this model and just purchase 4GB of RAM ( 2x2GB for $ 92 or 1x4GB for $ 99 ) , and save yourself $ 100 than the other model with 8GB of RAM .
Call tech support , standard email the form and fax it back in to us .
Since I never really got to use this , I ca n't comment on anything except what went wrong after trying 2 of them .
" I 've had it now about 2 months and absolutely LOVE IT .
One bad thing is it gets hot .
It was also suffering from hardware ( keyboard ) issues , relatively slow performance and shortening battery lifetime .
just chill and enjoy .
Again , the same problem , the right speaker did not work .
I was n't really as concerned about portability ( it 's a very large laptop ) but it 's not hard to move around or take on a trip which was a pleasant surprise .
I was n't a big fan of the Netbooks but this one was very well designed .
My battery went bad about a year and a half after having it and it cost around eighty to a hundred dollars !
I bought this last week , and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the touch-mouse stopped responding .
I ordered four D620 laptops .
The only thing I wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16 " laptop does .
In fact I still use manyLegacy programs ( Appleworks , FileMaker Pro , Quicken , Photoshop etc ) !
The quality , engineering design and warranty are superior -- covers damage from dropping the laptop .
A couple things you should know :
The display is beyond horrible .
Its white color is stylish for college students and easy to take to carry and take to classes .
Well , they do n't care a bunch .
the mouse is way way way to sensitve .
Thank goodness for OpenOffice !
Unfortunately , it runs XP and Microsoft is dropping support next April .
air has higher resolution but the fonts are small .
I am currently out of town and called to inform them the broken part would be returned when I got back in town .
I 'm hoping that I can find a really quick way to clean it without it getting too gross .
The second issue I had with it occured a month later and it kept overheating , even if on for less than an hour !
I bought this laptop because of the performance to price ratio .
The first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty .
As a lifelong Windows user , I was extremely pleased to make the change to Mac .
I seem to be having repeat problems as the Mother Board in this one is diagnosed as faulty , related to the graphics card .
Time will tell .
I would recommend this product .
I was originally concerned that I could n't view work I had done in college on my Mac because of the PC formatting , but I was even more thrilled to learn of programs like iLife and iWork that allow you to convert your PC documents into readable files on Macs .
The PhotoBooth is a great program , it takes very good pictures with the built-in camera .
However , there are MAJOR issues with the touchpad which render the device nearly useless .
It is easy to find documents , and keep them in one area .
But no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it ON THEIR WEBSITE !!!
