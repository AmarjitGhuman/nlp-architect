i went to an at &#38; t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads .
and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
my goal of using it as a music player * and * data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake .
i followed their advice but that failed , too .
from there , you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player ( with the help of the media sniffer .. . read the manual ).
* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ).
if you are buying a zen xtra check whether the battery recharges via usb ; it does not on the zen nx .
sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !
i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work !
excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players .
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .
the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal .
what 's going on creative labs ?
overall an excellent phone .
right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras .
do not recommend .
perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy " off " brands .
once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player .
like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it .
the pros and cons of it :
thanks for nothing , amazon !
the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .
i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n't work !
unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs .
the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code , but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go .
the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .
but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on it have a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments .
i have not yet tried the cd-ripping program .
if it can fit in the drive bay , this dvd player will play it .
i have had no problems with the phone .
needless to say , the canon won , hands down .
otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .
because once the moment is gone , it is not coming back .
use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run .
word ... peace in the east bruvah .
plugged it in .
reading other reviews , i do n't think the replacement one will be any better .
bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it .
i always shoot using the lcd panel .
overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it .
canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .
and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs .
the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use .
a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .
the remote is a little hard to understand .
if you have the money and need 40 gb , this is the player for you .
i received this as a gift .
i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well .
the first one we installed did n't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least .
-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .
the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .
sound quality is amazing . i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .
my choices at that moment were to manually re-tag my music or re-rip using mediasource .
its great .
. lens cap is a really annoying
this was the closest alternative and best buy for this type .
the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .
usually around the time the 90 day warranty expires .
i 've compared this phone to others such as 6100 , siemens sl55 .
ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category .
the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try .
simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
the zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced .
" you can send it in , but i would n't count on ever seeing it or a replacement again .
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .
5 for " digital film " it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome .
overall i 'm happy with my toy .
the headphone jack acts as a pseudo line out jack .
through the software you can classify songs in genres .
the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .
i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover .
they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .
i just got screwed out of fifty bucks .
i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing .
well , anyway i could go on and on on why this player did n't meet my expectations .. .
now where did i put that manual ?
there should have been a recall on this product .
the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it .
it has never worked .
basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n't used .
i 've gotten used to it ( holding it in just the right realation to the ear , ducking into quieter places in bars ) but when others borrow it they 're shocked i can use it .
negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .
anyway , on with the review .
this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .
if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .
2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .
it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to " get into " it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .
if you purchase this product , definitely rip your songs through windows media player .
i would say that this is not a major issue , but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things .
3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything .
bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations .
i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response .
also , there is the need to send the ipod to replace the batteries when they die ( which they will ).
at this time , i decided to turn the player on , and much to my surprise it comes with quite the little library of classical music , one of which is a childhood favorite , bach 's air .
everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
there are no other aftermarket cases available for this model yet , so you have to live with it .
hope i helped !
i 've picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful .
for more info on digital cameras , go to dpreviews .
instead , i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in .
a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .
the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc. other nicities , that you would enjoy .
this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas .
the fm radio is cool .
also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .
would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .
i did quite a bit of research before buying this camera , and this one had everything i was looking for .
nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon .
i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient .
i think most of you people complaining about no video is due to you hitting the wrong button either the p/n = pal / ntsc or the i/p is set to progressive scan .
apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy .
consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download , it 's well worth the little extra money .
sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization .
the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .
it also has an optical out , which it should .
i am not talking milliseconds .
you can even skip that step and rip them directly from the cd to the player .
after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !
do n't buy this player .
if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 !
size and style :
for three months , i 've researched the internet and magazines , queried various sales personnel , and took hands-on in-store test drives .
buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever .
the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .
i am surprised amazon still carries this after all of the continued problems .
i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer , and then transfer them to a friend 's .
is it a coincidence that i no longer can get any of your nomad zen xtras ( worst name ever ) at best buy and now the 60gb nomad xtra is " sold out " or more likely " discontinued " at the almighty amazon.com ?
a few things that might make it even better :
a similarily priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room .
way less expensive than the ipod .
first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds .
i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .
i can 't speak to its long-term reliability , as i 've only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point .
read the directions !
it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory ( smaller / lighter ) and the 30gb uses a hard drive .
their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .
- well-backlit keypad
this thing does its job .
sure it 's " old school " to carry a cd wallet around , but it will be easier to manage and i 'll save around 250 bucks .
although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan , they still did n't ship it .
the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .
i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .
the software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience .
learning how to use it will not take very long .
i can only confirm what other customers have said - crap !
this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared .
if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty .
i would recogmend this player to anyone i know , and you will not be dissapointed .
the player 's mechanics are also flawed .
i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it !
so what are you waiting for ?
the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .
the fact that the " 0 " key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the " # " key instead .
what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ?
of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest .
the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint .
ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras .
but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose .
i would recommend replacing the existing software with the " notmad explorer , " which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .
it 'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it .
so i had to give up and return it , having lost about 4 hours .
again , though , it has only been used sparingly .
but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .
if you 're investing in a camera at this level , buy this software !
the second one was the 2500 which i think is better than the 2600 because it has more features such as karoake which i do use sometimes for parties .
i bought this dvd player in november .
took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
for prospective buyers , i would warn of the following : 1 ) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible , as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable ( this applies to earbuds in general , ) and 2 ) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them , that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves .
from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles .
as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll .
in summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range .
buy an extra battery - life is good but still somewhat short .
getting files onto it is quick and painless .
i dare you to surf the net and find the code .
the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype .
and man ... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player ... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title ..
( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . )
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
great phone .. .
size - bigger than the ipod
settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .
what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .
9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .
but it works perfectly fine on my parent 's computer .
i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 .
it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .
to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ;
it 's going back today , &#38; being replaced with the new samsung x105 .
4 ) it did play my jpeg photos but wow , trying to figure it out was really something !
having said that , this is what you do . " add to cart " !
the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find .
it sure does !
remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s .
2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong .
once again , the sound is awesome , the batter life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life .
well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players .
i do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand .
card reader is included .
after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends , i bought this nokia 6610 .
so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty !
the cd will be classified into a number of genres , and in multidisk sets , you can get separate classifications for different disks by the same artist and the same performance .
because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !
you can find any song quicky by an artist , album , or genre search .
this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !
battery life is ok .
you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them .
i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions , but does n't seem any of the buget cameras do .
but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
i should n't have been cheap , should have bought a toshiba .
i love my new nomad , its great !
it is easy to " focus " in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .
i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged .
the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .
great features .. .
i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .
for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer .
not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy .
what the hell is wrong with this thing .
forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer .
like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product .
also , if i want a family plan , which mean i need tw phones on a plan .. .
poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .
good thing i got a replacement plan .
when it arrives , you press the shutter release .
6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .
therefore , if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card , even if you unlock the phone , there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet .
i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time .
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .
the g3 looks like a work of art !
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .
what more could you ask for .
as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine .
i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution .
the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight .
i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .
( 1 gb = 1,000 mb )
advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .
what a junk .
if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one .
this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .
personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors .
i felt that i should write this comment asap , as i am quite excited in using its features .
i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone .
this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve .
i end up unplugging it from the wall for a few hours and when i try again it will work fine.at least until this problem arises again .
it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates .
battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive
canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives .
if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ).
1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
i can do that myself .
i am new to the whole digital camera thing ; well , new to the whole camera thing period , really .
it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .
+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control .
i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .
i purchased and returned this product , but not because of any glaring flaws in the design .
also , the instruction manual is very bad .
i know the saying is " you get what you pay for " but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse .
upon inspection i did find a small scratch on the surface and figured that to be the cause .
i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .
synchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized .
lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .
its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .
saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable , as i already had a coax cable .
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .
just for the heck of it , i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door , and the focusing was just fine .
playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .
after using it for a few weeks ( the amount of time before the hard drive crashed ) it revealed a few of its shortcommings .
i called creative and they said to send it in and they would decide if it in warranty .
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use .
i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review .
one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .
buy this for the storage and price , avoid it if you know nothing about computers .
these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .
i needed something with more power , so i bought a nikon coolpix 4300 .
only problem , if you think it 's going to be delivered in the 24hrs amazon claims , do n't hold your breath .
the reason for this the ipod has " a better user interface " .
the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's .
i even went as far as calling the technical support number on the disc .
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture .
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !
it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .
it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .
the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist , track name and album name .
a remote would have been cool too ... but lets not push it .
this is a great camera for you !
i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags .
easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot .
got a great deal from a reputable seller .
in fact , everyone who saw it thought i was " the man " and wo n't believe i returned it .
3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players
reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item .
now , even 1 star seems like i 'm giving creative the benefit of the doubt .
no issues as of yet
im taking mine back tomorrow morning , and getting a nice shiny new ipod instead .
i saw another review saying his only gripe was a lack of voice dialing .
i bought this as a gift for my sister .
unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .
perhaps because of its smaller user base there is also a lack of accessories .
the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .
with progressive scan , i expect it to play play play - and give my old pioneer a rest .
however , the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems .
i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels .
the ipod costs more for the same amount of memory .
but i would expect that , since my movie discs have all played with no problem , the extras discs would , too , without any additional tweaking .
after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .
will never purchase apex again .
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .
all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .
ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .
the price compared to the ipod is great .
the features are really cool like the radio .
even if there happened to be identical track titles on the same disc , you could still edit the file name manually and get them both onto the player .
anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 .
now i can always be in contact .
it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs .
you know why ?
-- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library .
also , the lens cap design is flawed .
now , i thought it 's time to upgrade .
stayed up all night trying to figure out that thing .
i 've even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive .
for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .
well , not with this one .
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .
i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .
also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 " tv ).
if you arent hooked up to cddb to get the album info i guess you have to manually input the stuff , but that little work will save you looking for songs .
the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .
after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for .
i returned it once , then i sent it back , and it is crap .
the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?
this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
you could have paid more and got a lot less .
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .
i 'll still use my photosuite for editing .
so it is probably " just bad luck " on my part that the personal notebook i own had this install error .
i would suspect that there are similar problems with all of the other brands as this is somewhat new technology .
it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented .
mixed bag i guess but the price was right .
songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver .
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .
highly recommended .
it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .
the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better .
the light auto-correction is awesome .
the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
four megapixels is great .
i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon .
the cd just has too many problems with win xp .
it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
not just the transfer software ( which was a hellishly horrible experience ) but also the player 's software .
in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
i got mine for $ 160 less than the ipod 30gb ( got an extra $ 30 off for applying for an amazon visa ... thanks amazon ! )
i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong .
- no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking
i definately recommend a large memory card .
3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .
my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .
i hope my next player doesnt breakdown . .
if you have a good digital camera , there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone .
great features . .
one minor complaint :
this thing is trash .
while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd .
operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .
it wo n't play all of my movies .
features that would have been nice :
all these phones have color screens , polymorphic tones , and are internet ready .
no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad .
this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before .
over time , i loaded hundreds of cds onto the computer , and the idea of carrying around all of my music with me became attractive .
what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies .
it has a nice color screen .
i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .
if this doesnt bring back the picture , try pressing this button without playing a dvd .
in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .
recently , i attended a " flyball " competition
size and weight :
. go ; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card .
i am back to using # 1 .
most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy .
you can stop playback by pressing 2 buttons , first the pause button , then the " next track " or " previous track " button .
ability to play most discs - i tried dvd , vcd , dvd-r , audio cd and it played all
dim or bright , it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out , after the tae kwon do kick broke the board .
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .
the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .
nokia does not disappoint in this model .
now what about the flash problem ?
if it were not for that i would have given it 4 .
have tried calling ( 866-4apexgo ) , but can 't get through .
my story is based on personal usage .
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
it is connected to an old television set via composite video and analog audio outputs .
* scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models .
the battery recharges real fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .
the zen nx is $ 100 cheaper than the ipod of the same size , so you have to wonder just how much apple 's markup is anyway !
i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move .
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .
when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .
my gut tells me i 'll also end up buying an ipod .
after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it .
+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .
anything this phone does , it does perfectly .
i have 100 of my cd 's transferred and have n't made a dent in the 30 gb drive .
i waited a few years between phones , mostly because ( like most i think ) i didnt really need one .
the upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions .
i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones .
first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .
after much research i decided on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
hope to get my refund in a timely manner .
i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .
worse of all , they claim that it 's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty !
in a quick summation , here is what i found .
i got it now , and i 'm diggin ' it .
controls easy yo use and easy to get to .
also , very light and portable .
i am still trying to figure out the may options it has .
sometimes when i get really lonely , i like to put on some kenny g and light some candles , and while this does n't help , i am a capitalist pig and like buying things too , nah mean ! ?
the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !
i am returning mine for a replacement , but if i receive another ad-2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund , but never buy another apex product in the future .
however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures .
i guess that i can not complain since it does not actually claim to play vcd / svcd formats , but others say they can .
so far the software for the pc works easily .
if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 !
1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office .
it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .
( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ).
after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift .
i have not yet tried the photo show capability , but i 'm thinking that will probably work well too , based on the success with the above mentioned disks .
. images taken indoor were n't so clear .
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used .
i purchased the extended warranty ( something i almost never do ) when i returned the unit to get the replacement .
i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one .
they piggy-back on cingular 's service .
in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .
although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .
- outstanding signal reception
beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .
it ships with a carrying case that has a belt clip on it .
here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :
then you can say , " my dissapointment only cost $ 39 . "
i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .
i have a large collection of cds and have loaded over 100 of them so far .
so i took it back to best buy where i bought it and exchanged it for a newer zen 20 gig model .
i 'll just say this .. .
the lcd screen was very large and readable .
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .
i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus .
cheaper to produce , holds a lot , heavier and has moving parts which means it 's a little more prone to damage from being banged around .
bought one for $ 49.99 .
i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year .
but you do n't have to be .
despite all the hype about ipods , i knew i wanted something different , because i wanted more storage than the ipod i could afford would offer , and because i wanted more flexibility in where i purchased music online .
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera ..
i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes !
spend the extra 20 $ and buy a name brand dvd player .
i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .
the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive .
the first one was the 705 which i hacked successfully to play all region dvds and disable macrovision .
for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .
downloads are a snap and quick .
you can 't find the mpeg playback on high priced units .
battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours .
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house , that one didn " t work either !
this is the 4 apex player that i have bought .
1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .
maybe i 'll get lucky with the next one .
2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax .
update : the finish is more " mirror " than silver -- and i like it !
another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .
on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .
it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier .
they are not wowable good .
if i wasnt a runner i would take a bullet in the foot for my nomad jukebox .
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .
what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy .
to me this alludes to the manufacturer 's confidence that the product will last for a year .
if you 're intrested in buying a spare battery it 'll run you another $ 50 , a little steep i thought .
the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .
after the first one fatally crashed , the replacement did not work .
longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .
now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school !
i originally purchase a 30 gb nomad zen xtra as a portable mp3 player .
while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones .
the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .
another plus in my book , no file limits !
that was a mistake .
however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off .
the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) .
the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .
the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .
i wish i could give negative stars !
drop if just a few inches on a hard surface and the faceplate pops off ( but not if it 's in its case ) .
there is n't need to get in details again , but just remember it rocks because : price , sound , ease of use , and features .
the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player.for the first three hours , and then it died .
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .
some of the more geeky ( non-apple type ) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface .
nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .
the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .
while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better .
even if it has n't expired , creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty .
let 's face it - when you want to watch a movie you want to see a picture .
i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard .
based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal .
1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .
i just bought this player today and i already love it .
it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .
this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver .
messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .
i do n't want to install software and drivers on every computer i 'm ever at .
color screen is good .
1 no direct firewire to the camera .
i ordered this player for christmas , and so far i have it for only 2 weeks .
this is the best dvd player i 've purchased .
however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much .
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?
you can always spend more money to get a better one .
just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos .
quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .
do n't buy this thing .
but who wants the wires involved .
every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .
lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage .
radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpiece in .
great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !
perhaps there is a tone of irony in the title of my review , but i actually mean it in earnest .
you can customize bass , etc. like usual , but also you can customize the sound of the player ( like how it would sound in a concert hall , jazz club , etc ).
they take excellent macro shots as well .
hehe , my bad .
i am a soldier serving in baghdad right now .
zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .
the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
one bad thing though , i find the remote control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does .
the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .
it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do .
otherwise feedback seems to be good .
oh my goodness --
i purchased this unit 3 months back and i think the unit knew when my warrenty expires .
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .
you are not able to simply import files , but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them .
flash card memory vs. hard drive ( i.e. why does a 256 mb player cost $$$...and a 40 gb ( 40,000 mb ) player only cost
we also looked at the fuji fps602 .
the sound quality is very good .
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .
when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with .
after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another , i got fed up and have decided to return the phone .
navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .
i do hope that they offer more faceplate options .
* lens visible in optical viewfinder .
not sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear .
the camera was a marvel .
the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .
it did also seem to have a strong " new electronics " smell for some time .
you can 't simply open up a folder from the player and play all the songs in it .
like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .
i will just say this :
be forewarned .
i 've registered this unit at www.apexdigialinc.com and listed the problem .
very happy !
after messing with it at a store i noticed how bad the i-pod was .
i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .
i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable .
that 's a rare and valuable feature .
you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though .
i just want to at least try an exchange but you can 't get through to their number , it 's always busy .
we 'll see if i need them to .
only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet .
however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .
i 'm not looking forward to ripping my entire collection every month or two .
the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk .
granted this is cheaper than an ipod .
i used it lightly , and it lasted just over one year ( forgot to kill the power one day , and now it only plays dvds ).
it practically plays almost everything you give it .
i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any product ) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes .
consider it for a future gift too !
these problems were consistent , and also not present on another dvd player .
* slick-looking design and improved interface
apple 's solution - pay apple another $ 400 + for a new ipod ( less a paltry discount ) .
( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )
hopefully , this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod .
after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .
in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .
forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds.
mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs .
the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .
i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .
the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .
friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased .
like most people , i do n't want to read the instructions , i just want to use it .
a. the cddb downloads information for the cd that you insert such that you do not have to type in the track information such as album , artist , song title , etc.
if my level of care was n't good enough , i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two .
it takes great pictures .
i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .
it is a very amazing product .
i paid $ 49 and now it 's $ 125 !
i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend .
thankfully amazon has free return shipping !
unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed .
( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however )
* protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window .
that 's a huge difference ... especially in this price range .
i had no problems following their installation instructions .
as soon as i lifted the unit out of the box , i questioned my judgement .
i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know .
i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash unit .
i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway .
also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy .
i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .
this almost made it worth the price alone .
i 've tried someone elses and the same thing happens .
some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .
the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd .
the pictures are amazing .
it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade !
the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place .
i bought this thing because it plays everything .
the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more .
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .
in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .
to discover this i had to read about 10 online reviews ( with many complaints about the lack of stop button ) before i found one reviewer who was smart enough to both figure it out & document it .
a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names .
i refused to go for an ipod , i am not going to spend all that money just for the apple name and because it is " trendy " to have that player .
one thing puzzles me is that for " fine and 2200 + " quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .
as mentioned above i broke the player within the 1st 10 days .
great colors , pictures and white balance .
like the zen , the karma does not support folders and is not designed to be a data storage device .
in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it .
i got the 40gb jukebox zen xtra for christmas .
a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop
it was always after it finished a process or something , so it did n't cause any file errors .
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it .
i think this is it 's biggest flaw .
there have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time , upon powering it up it starts on the " now playing " screen with a song or cd that i had been playing days before .
do not buy this product or any apex product unless you are looking to be frustrated and lose money !
when i first purchased the unit i downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website .
great camera .
i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .
as i travelled internationally and did n't want to haul it back on a plane with me it was an expensive addition to the recycling bin .
well thats about it , and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up , stil havent happened to me , and i hope it doesnt .
the person i talked to suggested i take the dvd player back and swap it out with another .
anybody can explain that ?
+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .
yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .
the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .
i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .
the g2 was better in this respect .
assuming you have filled in all the id3 tags on your mp3s , you will not have any problem finding them on your zen xtra .
my room is so dark and when i tried taking pics of it with my old camera , they came out black , but with this , they look the same in the picture as in real life .
also , the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with .
could not stop it , could not get out of the " now playing " screen .
games are ok for a cell phone , but mp3 's are for music .
maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again .
if you buy the stereo headset , you will enjoy it much more .
the top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable .
with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet .
many of our disney movies do n't play on this dvd player .
- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .
i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .
while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .
the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .
many reviewers refer to it as " clunky " or " difficult " - heed their warnings .
and so i must ask , what are cameras for ?
i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it 's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) .
connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !
so .. .
and then you will start to belive them .
and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .
go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense .
cameras capture moments .
the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones .
the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .
i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive .
canon 's g3 does it consistently .
i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .
you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .
it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .
4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .
i searched on the internet and found one tip which solved our problem : press i/p button on the remote control .
a card with more memory is a must .
granted it is a little more than the zen , it is well worth it .
this player seems to work fine with everything else .
it is a beast .
buy new ones asap. every time you move your face or something they pop out .
the phone may look large but it is very small smaller then the 3390 phone .
if the casing of the player is this bad , i can 't image that the hardware is of very good quality .
if you can live without an integrated camera , you wo n't miss much more .
the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .
the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .
apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .
this camera will stay with me for years !
3 . it 's a hazard in the car .
i 'll state up front that i do not own a zen xtra and have not used one at all .
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .
it is not perfect though .
with the nomad explorer software , songs should be drag-and-drop .
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc .
if you have a question , they have the answer .
after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .
the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .
it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .
is this possible to fix , if so how , if not does notmad explorer from red chair software do this ?
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .
a dock is unnecessary as the charger and usb cable do the necessary .
hope this review has helped you in making up your mind .
navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
the speakerphone :
i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember :
pay a few more bucks and get something else - it 'll be worth it in the long run .
even at the " normal " setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a " digital " .
i 've had no problems with the software .
this player is an ideal purchase .
it is great to no longer wonder what music i want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip - now i just take everything .
sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .
it 's easy .
i have read a lot of the reviews and my phone does not have a hiss or anything that people are talking about .
i did have some problems figuring out how to turn the unit on , but creative did a good job with this , as they had a clearly labled " on " button that i found when i left my cellar for the first time in years .
most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist .
the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .
having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers .
this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .
i do n't care how it looks and i always drive so the size is not important to me .
that is , if a folder on your computer called " mp3 " has slayer ( thrash metal ) , stravinsky ( classical ) , and ice cube ( rap ) in it , you will only be able to play the contents of that folder by searching for the artists or genres manually .
buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem ..
only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .
when you load a disc , you go to an internet cite for the insertion of the names for the cd and the tracks .
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
wow , dennis sure is great !
so far the dvd works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i 've read .
fm receiver - it has none .
with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .
any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort .
this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap .
therefore im saying im returning it right now , and i will see wat happens with my next zen xtra ( same replacement ) .
got a " system error " problem 30 days after purchase .
i bought this phone when it first came out in the summer .
after about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player .
file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2.0 .
you can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later .
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n't had any problems .
while i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so ( from the purchase date ) to obtain one .
the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .
all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .
some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get .
the less computer-saavy might find apple 's software a bit friendlier , though ( i use it at a friend 's house and it does do a lot more for you . )
otherwise it 'll get there the day you get back from the hospital !
maybe it 's good for tvs with not so good color settings , but not good for my tv that already has very vibrant pictures .
this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cdr / cdrw / dvdr / dvdrw , and of course plays dvd movies from uk. i love the aiff , progressive scan feature .
it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed-light settings .
i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures .
try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .
they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy .
i finally decided to upgrade , and started my research .
after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds .
i 've got 1200 songs on it now and about 4000 more to go .
before i decided to get this player , i did my research .
big mistake .
it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more .
this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways .
that 's important because i have a lot of music .
i 'd have given it 5 stars , but i 'm waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one :
for me the sound of the music is what is important .
the software , mediasource , cannot work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) .
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .
within 5 minutes i was able to transfer files .
also , i downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates .
tech support could n't figure it out and gave up .
for work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well .
i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .
also bought a soundblaster card that they sold for the mac .
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price .
updating the unit 's firmware :
it lasted about 1 1/2 weeks .
i just got it today and have tried to verify the claims of other reviewers .
the zen has no stop button .
this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records .
on my relatively new computer ( p4 with windows xp and usb 2.0 ) , the os complained about the installation of the drivers .
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .
very cheaply made .
i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy .
i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !
if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .
whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .
this is not the same thing as a film camera .
if i knew then what i know now i would have paid the extra to get an ipod & avoided the zen .
my favorite is to play " any track " - am rediscovering my music !
nothing but hassle with this company .
i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever .
all i am looking for is a rebate form !
they fall in love with the product .
like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels .
the plus points are -
the storage capacity is great .
i love the quality of the pictures .
the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical
save money on the long run - buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month .
the second one is up and running .
your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment .
for more , you sacrifice weight and size : more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length .
the karma does have a stop button .
it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly .
you will have a very expensive paperweight .
the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling .
the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )
it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files .
i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box .
i have my mp3 's stored on my workstation .
i considered this phone ( nokia 6610 ) , mainly because of my sister and the features .
2 ) scroll button / switch
the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle .
they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon 's .
first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .
it was worth a shot -- too bad it did n't work out .
my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .

i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use .
but this camera is great !
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .
here 's why :
i have an apex ad600 for a few years now which still works great today .
however , it does n't register instantly as a hard drive like other players .
4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .
nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke .
it plays all my back-ups , + or - , and everything else i have put in it without a hick up .
up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .
many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .
a great deal in general !
then sorting the files is easy as pie .
i would recommend buying one .
i particularly like the " txt " file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take .
just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc.
the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .
but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. .
i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times .
one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) .
buy this camera , you wo n't regret it .
as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .
their customer service is very poor .
this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .
it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .
good points :
it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .
so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .
it took them twice as long to get to my unit as they said .
if you have always on internet or are logged into the internet you can use the feature that will download the album & song id information ( this is a free service ) with the click of a button .
it has many great features and very few bad ones .
the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .
i am bored with the silver look .
moreover , they want a total of $ 107 to repair it .
and i am hoping the static i heard when using eax was a blip ...
yes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay .
do n't let my five star rating fool you .
i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .
the screen 's large and easily read .
thumbs down on that one .
finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 .
you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .
and most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase .
the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .
and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .
obviously there is no composite video output and different analog audio signals at progressive scan mode .
relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
this will cause the discs not to show up together when you are looking for them on the nomad .
awesome feature .
zen good points :
the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .
from what i 've heard it 's at least equal .
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .
imagine my shock - and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex .
nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .
the other company is currently " out of stock " so i ordered another from amazon and will be taking the original back to the competitor today .
so far the player froze on me once ( i started pushing buttons before it loaded ) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that .
when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken - the motor would not eject discs or close the door .
8 battery life is excellent .
it 's money down the drain .
it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n't the only one this happened to . )
this is an edited review , now that i have had time to use the device .
the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .
with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it .
my one recommendation to creative is to get some marketing people to work on the names of these things .
i 've had no problem with canon whatsoever .
rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .
the grain was terrible .
these are minor problems , and i list them to save anyone else the trouble of discovering them .
i did n't even try the included software .
( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .
this is extemely lame .
i have n't figured it out yet .
- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .
do n't drop this unit :
boy was i wrong .
without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
i just used the explorer program to move my songs to my player .
when the previous versions of the zens were shipped with musicmatch , people had this problem because musicmatch creates both sets of tags , which seem to confuse the zen xtra .
i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .
my first impression was positive .
the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .
it using something called ac3 ( at least the trial song i purchased was in this format ) which is not a compatible format for the nomad .
the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .
i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product .
but for now this will do .
overall design :
a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .
what kind of a company does that !
possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .
i like the default blue .
if you want to be a poser and follow the herd , mooooooh , then buy the i-pod .
the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .
get it , it 's woth every penny ! !
the vibrate setting is loud !
thank you very much , and go out and get yourself a nomad !
5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
at the same time , i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons .
it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . )
a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins , accesses files or does antyhing .
finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .
there are plenty other features that i have n't checked out , but i 'm sure i soon will .
it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
i spent much time debating on whether i should go with the zen xtra or the ipod .
i have done some research and experimenting with the remote when my apex ad-2500 seemed to have lost its video signal .
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 .
whatever you do , do n't buy this product .
they said it is in stock , but they are " too busy " .
to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod .
i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .
scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .
i have no complaints with this mp3 player .
forget about it .
as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) .
( i guess only time will tell ? )
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much .
* removable battery
