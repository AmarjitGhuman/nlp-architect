despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. .
the image quality is excellent .
excellent idea !
i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) .
because this camera is beautiful .
to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press " menu " on the remote while the dvd is playing .
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .
not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .
i 'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i 've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top , but that does n't stop me from loving this camera .
the higher the number the better the quality ( less data compression is used ) and the larger the file size .
now i have to return it and rip all my music again .
yes it is 56k speed , but the functionality is what you are paying for .
this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .
the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .
first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most aesthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture .
buy this camera and savour it .
i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .
what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it .
most people love the appearance and praise the touch sensitive buttons .
what a disappointment !
range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
do n't get me wrong , the thing was like heaven for about a week .
my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .
i 've been using it for about 3 months now .
i have to rip everything as a 160 kbps wma file ( as opposed to 128 kbps mp3 ) to avoid hearing digital garbling .
following my research , i decided on the g3 .
my brother bought an ipod this past summer and my dad bought the original zen around the same time ..
it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .
this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he 'd answered all my questions ( same interaction as i just described ) , and well .. .
when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was .
this is a powerful piece of equipment .
had to buy my dad a different dvd player locally ( panasonic ) which worked just fine .
i 'd look elsewhere .
do n't waste your time , engery , resources on this thing , just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod .
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .
a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )
i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it .
i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him .
the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers .
the price is way below an ipod of the same size .
the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .
4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .
i give it 10 stars !
rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this
very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has .
when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .
this thing , while looking pretty cool , is not as sexy as the ipod .
after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .
and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?
so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one .
what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .
karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity .
one horrible flaw , or mayybe more than one .
i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept .
however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
spend the money its well worth it .
i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .
it was either the 40gb ipod or this one .
when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .
i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great .
we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work " apex " dvd players and none worked .
so then i came across the ipod ( 10 gb ) .
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e. , mp3s ) .
reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .
that is where my satisfaction ends .
it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .
so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift .
press the p/n button located on the bottom right corner of the remote .
the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .
from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .
3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .
you have to add all the songs to a play list .
the battery life on this phone is surreal .
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .
all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .
everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .
however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips .
once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers .
although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint .
a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine .
they sent me a new ad2600 with the same problem .
if you have any doubts about this player , well do n't .
i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .
software - the software is crap .
best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .
it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much .
or does it play audio and video but scrolling in black and white ?
about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .
the ipod is a one way only machine - from computer to player .
i 've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual .
other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .
but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions , even if they did n't , to which they always seem to expect a " yes " answer from you .
i am a nikon fan , and owned and used slr nikon fe , n50 and n90s for many many years .
well to say , i had a very bad history with players .
10 great price for all the features .
a nice camera bag , which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger .
apex 's website is down and they wo n't answer their phone .
that is a very nice feature .
that 's the first thing to understand .
many before me have done that already .
pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent .
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
i have n't tried setting up any playlists yet so i can 't comment on any problems there .
the screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it .
no complaints there .
battery life :
hi , many people are saying , " you get what you pay for , i guess . "
i can only hear the sound but no picture !
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon .
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .
3 ) 4x zoom is nice
you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .
i listened to it for several days before needing to recharge them .
not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want .
i got weird messages about it not being ok 'd by microsoft ( or something like that ) , then i thought it failed to load , then it loaded .
by what time standards -- martian ?
other than that this thing is great ...
if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe .
i do n't really like bounce .
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out !
4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed .
well , maybe that particular song was just corrupt , so i tried to upload some of my own , after four attempts , at each one the unit locked up and required a reboot , i managed to upload an album , which albeit was surprisingly fast , however when attempting to create a playlist out of my newly uploaded songs , the nomad again froze up and refused to work .
as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr .
which was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone ...
1 ) fm receiver - some models out there have this .
basic shipping was a bit slow , but that 's okay .
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed !
ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier .
4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
if you 're a jogger and you want to strap it to your arm , i 'd recommend flash memory .
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .
i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .
it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .
it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .
you do n't have this problem if you make your playlist from the nomad , where cds are listed separately .
the vibration is not top .
the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod .
i have a dvd burner .
interface - practically seamless .
we did n't get to use it again for over a month ( sad , i know ) .
for once , though , this 3rd party software is excellent .
people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant .
now i dont have to lug around 80 cds if i dont know what i 'm going to want to listen to biking home .
this is a great investment for someone like me who enjoys music and hates carrying multiple cds .
i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner .
battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .
but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it !
both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610 .
seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) .
but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working .
having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .
removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .
that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce .
it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .
if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books .
transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy .
if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !
it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .
8mb for a camera like this is a joke .
one thing i should note is that i have only had this product for one day , so there are many options i have not explored .
if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual .
ok this is our first dvd player so what do i know .
very bad quality .
i simply love this feature .
i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .
i used a canon powershot s20 for about 2.5 years and loved it !
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .
in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !
the included earbuds were uncomfortable .uncomfortable -1
i highly regret trying to save a few $ with this purchase .
( throw a cell phone and you 're asking for trouble . ) 3a .
the only creative software i am using is the device driver ( s ).
my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the " year " field .
maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .
gee ... thanks a lot creative .
we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .
again , you can change this , but it 's harder to spot a minor variation in the title when you do n't have the title of the other disk in front of you .
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .
pro : 1 .
i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along .
usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast .
i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .
both creative and third-party powered speakers work great , as do third-party wireless transmitters .
when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .
i was trying to decide whether or not i should go with the 40 gb ipod or this 30 gb zen xtra .
you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .
no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .
5 hours max. i did it like this
the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .
do not buy this product --
in my case , the bill was $ 81 , about a third of what i paid for it .
honestly , i love this player .
there is probably an easier way to do this , i just have n't found it yet .
it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .
at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .
in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this camera .
the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode .
the built-in camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff .
this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .
the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix .
the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .
had to cut out a window using a swiss army knife .
but the earbuds suck !
and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality .
the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla .
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly .
although you may think you 're dealing with amazon , you 're dealing with some second rate store that you 've never heard of .
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did .
after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. .
it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .
i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast .
third party software to the rescue
the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage .
update : january 27th 2004 - the second one crapped out only after a week - dont buy this product !
nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .
got way too many blurry pictures .
its really cool .
the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .
when i turned eax off the static disappeared .
the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car .
the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line .
the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an " auto " mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .
does your apex dvd player only play dvd audio without video ?
after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .
it can get pretty lonely out there .
i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .
both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going .
the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .
i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond .
first of all , many actions that the player utilizes do n't make sense . .
definetely a great camera .
+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .
now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
it 's not a big deal for me .
the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .
bought two ad2600 's for christmas .
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen .
i love this camera .
it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .
amazon has been working with me to refund my money , but they reminded me that i have past the 30 day return policy and this was a courtesy return .
overall i like the unit .
prior to christmas , it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad !
in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .
it worked good for a while .
the rio karma feedback suffers from sensitivity in the hard disk .
guess where this unit is headed ?
the title says it all ...
its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .
in all a winning combination .
if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are .
can 't say whether i rec 'd an " updated " model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me .
lastly , you cannot manage anything on the ipod itself .
on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !
it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for .
100 % perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos .
want the laundry list of reasons why ?
i use a 128mb card , and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 1024-1280 res. , with good resolution .
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all .
i will never go back to my archos again ! !
i got this dvd player as a gift and had to send it back .
- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it .
ipod can be used as an external disk , and apparently stores files without problem .
the technology is finally here folks , to make your photo life easier .
i would n't gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas .
there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful .
no way , now i have an ipod and i 'm a very happy man .
after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd .
i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy .
owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide .
the way to fix this is to rename the track by adding a number yourself to the end of the track listing .
my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home , but now she 's forever asking for the digital camera .
i can 't comment on the quality of the audio , because it was back at the store before i ripped a single cd .
i ordered two of these puppies for christmas gifts .
this does n't affect the picture , of course .
it says i have a harddisk problem .
4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much .
just maintain them ( phonebook , calendar and to-do list ) in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth .
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .
this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ).
no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .
1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 " or 5x7 " prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 " photos once in a while .
usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it .
- very long-lasting battery life
2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .
other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .
can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go .
the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .
the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance .
the player controls are too easy to hit accidentally .
i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media .
ipod has no stop button ; when new users mention this ipod veterans call it " unnecessary " and " so 20th century " .
it took over 2 months and repeated follow-up to get it replaced .
i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
( did i mention you can actually change the battery ? hello ? apple ? are you listening ? )
looking at the glowing reviews from people that have had this for a week or two , i kind of wish people would wait until they 've had a product a little while to review it .
i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player .
you can also set a background wallpaper .
the door would not close .
i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .
so much packed in a small case and very affordable !
there are n't many reviews for the iriver ihp .
but you might find my review useful , nonetheless .
the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .
i was able to return it to the retailer where i bought it and got a replacement .
this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket .
however , i should have followed my instincts :
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .
i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .
the trouble shooting section in the user 's manual , suggesting correct and secure connections , does n't help .
i could n't load more than one song before the software crashed .
they would n't repair my camera unless if i pay $ 100 for parts ? and labor !
a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included .
what the heck is up with the 2600 .
the distortion is not a flaw .
the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .
having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying .
since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make .
however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .
additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. )
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .
use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) .
zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .
well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) .
all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n't done it since .
but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture .
at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my " alias " dvds as well .
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .
get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash .
great price .
some of my friends had well branded dvd-players but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks !
overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .
crappy headphones .
the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .
i had all my files already on my pc in wma format ( 200 cd 's ).
so how can i do that ... are n't that free for two after the rebates .
i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .
all of the zens use a standard notebook drive .
apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .
i was , however .
overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages .
the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good .
1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )
perhaps there is a way around this delay .
a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .
so , if you read the instructions well , you should n't have any problems with this dvd unit .
the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .
the player : it 's silver .
hopefully you wo n't regret .
the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click .
i am going to have to try an online download and see if that works .
b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage .
no big deal for the size . .
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies .
if you can get this phone for cingular or at&t , go with the other carriers .
there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .
it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice .
but canon never fails to amaze .
1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its program and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings .
( my orignal review is below : )
if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .
the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .
however , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution .
you have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to , instead of just connecting it with a usb connection .
i 've compared and compared and compared .
another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it .
do yourself a favor and save your money to get something of better quality , or at least works .
i do n't think i was asking too much .
it also has unproven battery life .
- you just have to buy a new player .
the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap .
i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this .
i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it .
i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com .
as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale .
this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .
you will find it very hard or impossible to get you money back .
scroll bar :
i like the speakphone function a lot .
these are the reasons i think it 's great :
third , the poor design continues with the case .
it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !
there are a lot of things i like about it .
below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends :
i do n't write many reviews but i 'm compelled to do so with this camera .
( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .
other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .
i 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens .
you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country .
flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .
2 ) storage capacity
if you have windows me you should upgrade to xp anyway , lol .
i guess that 's why you so often see " ipodders " bashing every other player out there ( very often not knowing anything about them the whole " i spent $ 120 more for something not any better and so should you ... so i can feel better " thing .
i figured with a great first product and with this one having more features than the 600 i would buy one .
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing .
often i fill i need to have better organization for the library and there is not enought of variables .
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .
anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it .
it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .
i 'll have to borrow cd 's to rip from friends to even come close to filling the thing .
this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .
apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r/rw and another supports - r/rw ) .
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying .
unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is " player either not connected or busy . "
or better yet , buy from another company that stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty .
contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .
after i went through the transer issue , i returned the zen xtra and purchased the 40 gig ipod .
they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling .
this is one of those items that , at first glance , looked cool but did n't really ring a bell with me .
i bought this player as a christmas present for my wife .
if you decide to encode at 320 you will fit less on this device than someone who encodes at 128kps .
i bought the zen xtra 30g as a gift .
song transfers were not an issue .
having my entire music collection is great when travelling ( both on plane and car trips ) and i do n't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it 's all there .
i can 't believe people continue to pay those prices .
finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
so if you use your card reader ; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date ; time .
the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .
well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .
so buy the g3 .
another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on .
and then it breaks .
that player is a complete piece of sh ***.
it always pays off .
there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !
if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed , i would rate this a 5 star machine .
it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .
plays them all .
i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .
the software has n't been a hassle for me at all .
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .
i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .
the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .
i have not used the progressive scan feature .
i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out .
the movie mode is also working great .
but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. .
i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow !
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual .
go for it ...
i chose the canon speedlite 420 .
it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .
i eventually gave up with customer support and worked on fixing the problem myself .
the dvd player just would't recognize them .
fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
80 % of the features on here you will not get by spending $ 100 on a sony or panasonic .
and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod .
after reading all the glowing review on this camera , i went to my local camera shop to try one .
i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime .
c. i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer .
pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 .
i purchased a jukebox 3 from creative almost a year ago .
i initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining cds to mp3 .
it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid .
for example , i tried playing my new " pirates of the carribean " extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it .
i love this player .
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par .
i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3-year - old unit again just to see .
there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board .
the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you .
the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck .
after investigating a multitude of player options , i asked for and received the 60 gb zen xtra for christmas .
i have tried the belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter but found there was too much interference .
i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality .
i currrently have service with t-mobile , verizon , and t-mobile .
for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised .
usability ( button usage , feature selection , menu structure , display size and quality ) also has good feedback .
in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer 's remorse .
as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you wont scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys .
amazon , do your customers a big favor , do n't carry this item , and give them refunds !
in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it .
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .
the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .
accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .
i can only hear the sound .
it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches .
it 's no problem for me personally .
4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .
the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .
i am really impressed by this dvd player .
i purchased this as a christmas gift for my husband .
if i could give this a negative rating , i would .
considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .
back to the 2600 :
the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .
i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) .
the regular mode in this camera works for 80 % of settings .
it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here .
i 've had the player for about a month now .
the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did .
i purchased this as a christmas gift on 12-4 - 03 .
i bought this camera because it fit my budget and the pre-production and production model reviews were positive .
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .
i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. .
zennx 's capacity / price ratio on the 30g model ( $ 10/gig ) ) trumps ipod 's 30g model ( $ 14/gig ).
if the dvd is stopped , it will display " playback only " .
this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !
i experimented with installing mediasource on 2 other computers at home and it worked fine .
all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .
luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can 't .
that was n't pretty .
after much frustration ( above ) i found the notmad explorer ; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer & organization problems .
the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .
the only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow , leading to longer delays in some functions ( playback and even a slow display of the menu ? ) .
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .
if you plan to carry the device around ( it is a mobile device , right ? ) then this is something you might want to think about .
amazon.com promptly refunded my money for the first one , because a replacement was not available ( thanks amazon.com !
and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .
i pulled out our old non-progressive scan toshiba , hooked it back-up and the " finding nemo " dvd works fine .
i ordered 2 .
when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :
i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal .
signal strength will affect the battery life .
yet they 've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone , including italian , german , and dutch .
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there .
wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker !
seemed like a good deal , but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes , " no disc " .
but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there .
look / design :
i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it !
have used it frequently and have had no problems .
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .
- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .
- no propietary headset jack
it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds .
i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
i 'm editing my review , because now i wish i read the manual before returning the player i bought for my girlfriend .
the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .
red chair 's notmad explorer is great & recommended by about every reviewer to repleace the creative jukebox software .
however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
for most people , they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection .
the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .
if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300 , i would order another just like it .
amazon was supposed to send me another one , but did n't and sent me a gift certificate instead ( i 'm guessing because the price has gone up on this unit since december ).
this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ?
i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
great job canon !
the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .
overall this is a slightly better than average phone .
ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet .
best electronic i 've bought since i was born .
i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service .
sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much .
the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple .
2 . i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was n't comfortable with that .
warning - i did read the manual !
this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .
* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .
door broke after a month .
the price / performance looked just right .
overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .
i actually had to re-open the drawer and close it to get back to the dvd menu .
you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player .
basically wat happened , is that the hard drive failed .
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .
if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .
the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .
as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it .
but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .
so far not going to get a good review .
i received this dvd player free with the purchase of a palm tungsten e from officemax .
they look fantastic .
you just have to use the lcd viewfinder to see the whole picture .
i will never buy another apex digital product !
the nikon 's are great cameras .
frequent signal searches eat up battery power .
to say the least , i was horribly dissatisified with my service with sprint , which was why t-mobile was so fantastically refreshing .
like some other reviewers , i recieved this phone using t-mobiles upgrade program .
regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop .
i just sold my archos 20gb jukebox recorder after not being satisfied with it 's slow loading & difficult navigation , not to mention it froze quite a bit .
my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 " screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 " monitor .
i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy .
i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all .
i was so excited about the price and reviews of this dvd player .
left it set on my desk came back five minutes later and it just wanted to keep playing the same song over and over .
i personally do n't like apple or their business practices ( screwing resellers , customers and employees left and right ) so i shopped around for something else .
and really this is the best phone one could have .
if you have a lot of those , be prepared to convert to mp3 .
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use .
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain .
i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) .
that 's been my experience .
my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity .
5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .
having 4000 or so mp3s , i never got more than 500 transfered .
creative tech support operators work 9-6 p.m. weekdays - as if i had time during work hours to spend time on this .
but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .
it happened to me once .
another point of note : the battery life is incredible !
for me , i 'll save that cash for another purchase .
its quiet .
9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .
just point and shoot and the photos were great .
speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .
again , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional .
also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) .
this is pretty cool .
technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !
i am very pleased with it so far .
seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection .
7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .
vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this .
remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons .
4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying .
be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries .
it would have been better to have some sort of window on teh carrying case , so you could see the display without opening it .
all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift .
the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine .
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it .
the most important thing for me is sound quality .
in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software
overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do .
i doubt i will use half of the storage capacity , but you never know .
what kind of product goes out within a month ?
i was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke .
there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .
the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd .
the sound from the player is ok .
different people have different needs , of course , but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive .
the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good , but my feeling at this time is " two thumbs up " !
of course you do !
the devices competing with the ipod are the iriver ihp 120 , the rio karma , and the philips hdd100 .
the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .
i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .
all in all suprisingly easy to use .
i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out .
the ad-1600 did n't work corectly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up .
using this method , i have not once encountered a situation where a track was rejected , and i have plenty of duplicate tracks on live and compilation albums .
i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name .
i find this to be a great feature .
is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel .
this is especially useful for those who listen mostly to pop music and store all those short ditties .
for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price .
this camera has a major design flaw .
the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering !
compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use .
i am not associated with the company , i am not providing a url , but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily .
i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty . ( it 's fast too ! )
i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker .
i liked this one enough to buy another .
this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .
the case had ad2600 .
first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .
simply not as friendly for functional as an ipod .
- the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .
the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .
you will be told goldstar codes work , and you will be told zenith codes will work , and radio shack will give you apex codes but they will not work .
while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .
hopefully you still have the remote control .
that meant even less light and just as much action .
ok , im writing yet another review , about a week from my previous one .
you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do .
no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic 's for just a couple of keepers .
point the " media sniffer " to your music files and let it do the rest .
a 256 mb player ( roughly 60 songs for me ) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb ( 30,000 mb ) player ( roughly 6,650 songs ) sells for only slightly more .
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money .
but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .
i only have one question , when i add tracks to my nomad , via nomad explorer , they are automatically put in alphebetical order , rather than album order .
so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )
after using the bulky 3650 for three weeks , i searched for a smaller alternative .
my next thought was that the dvd must be damaged .
it seems like movement , even small movement , causes skipping in playback and even the device freezing .
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .
now i use ms mediaplayer , musicmatch ( free downladed ) , and " explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player " to replace the mediasource .
transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .
well , this apex dvd player turned out great !
some things that i did n't like ( but hey . nothing is perfect ).
it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .
but for $ 49.99 go get one !
i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular .
i love photography .
i think the reson for the creative being larger is for sound dampening and protection , whihc is a plus , but then again it is only speculation .
if you dont get video back , now you can run the player over with your car !
save them on computer and print out just the ones who want .
there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted .
now i know better .
what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses .
unfortunatly it was dropped and damaged a year after i bought it .
i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .
a disipointed customer .
2 . i do n't need the nomad at home for the same reason ( although using it to sync between the two pc 's might be a reason enough to get it . )
i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .
if the music had been on my home computer , the transfer would have been accomplished very quickly .
1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .
the ipod is also an attractable piece , being lightweight and small .
this camera performs like i can not believe !
the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .
3 . i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although , i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings .
it 's worth it .
the phone is very light weight .
nice little phone ... light compact . .
it lasts , truly , 7 days on standby .
here 's a hint : go to nokia.com and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth .
the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .
i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models .
save your cash - go for a brand that actually cares about their reputation .
i got one of these to serve as a second dvd player in my house .
proven canon built quality and lens .
there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) .
lot 's of other features that i need to find out about .
with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .
i hope i have helped you continue to enjoy the apex dvd player with these troubleshooting tips .
it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .
it 's a very intuitive program .
i love the eos based controls and easy menus .
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings .
if you want the other accessories the ipod offer , maybe that 's where you should go .. .
once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .
i expect the g3 will please me for years to come .
i ended up suing windows player to make mp3 's ( actually wma files ) and then using the probram to transfer .
so all you do is stick a pin or something small in the reset button & you 're golden .
also , if i had already loaded and tagged by cds on my home computer , this would not have been an issue .
picture scrolling in b/w :
the device is larger than an ipod of similar capacity .
so i finally gave them a deadline which they said they could meet .
- large easy readable screen
i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago .
enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy .
recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony .
3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust .
still , apple continues to squeeze dollars from consumers by not designing the battery to be replaceable .
they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it .
first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .
i spent $ 269 for my 30gb zx , compared to the $ 299 for a 10gb ipod and the also expensive iriver ihp-120 .
the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . "
grandma in church quiet .
i paid twenty dollars more than the current price , and even then it was a steal .
i am a business user who heavily depend on mobile service .
the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful " scene " mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless .
my past two phones were all flip phones , and i was beginning to tire of them .
i realize this is for quality assurance purposes , but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered ( i.e. me :
because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's .
the prior one looked and felt lightweight , cheesy , and assembled by the oppressed :
i will not be ordering another one to replace it .
so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad .
i can 't simply bring up my entire list of songs , click play , and then hit next .
i 'm not sure why people have problems with either the interface of the nomad , or the software that comes with the unit .
- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .
thought i 'd weigh in here with my stats .
i transfered all 16 gigs in 15 minutes without any errors via firewire .
it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .
( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n't play and they were new ones !
. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that .
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .
i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;
i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .
after a lot of research , i decided on the g3 .
d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver .
one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .
i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .
it really does n't make any cents $ $ to build a great reputation then destroy it from lack a research and testing in one season .
have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital.com ) , but the e-mail address is not valid .
it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves .
the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .
i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card .
the batteries would not charge .
my last mp3 player 's screen drove me nuts .
the sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with .
i replaced it with this not-quite-so-dazzling , but definitely more functional device .
have had problems since the first day
i was planning on getting an ipod , but i changed my mind last minute ... mostly because of the whole battery issue , i do n't have the patience for those sorta things .
b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display
what it lacks for me is n't available on one phone yet , namely gsm850 ( also sometimes known as gsm800 ) , bluetooth and edge .
the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .
purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it .
makes me use it much less than i otherwise would .
i was limited to 999 files in a playlist with archos ' os , now i can have as many as i want .
getting the printer to help output them was another tale .
the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .
each of the 4 lasted less than six months .
with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;
my sister has this series of phone and she loves the radio and headset .
here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of " plastic-like " ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .
there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize .
this is nothing new , every mp3 player , memory card , etc. , used for digital media today has some kind of preloaded operating software on it .
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .
the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small .
oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^
the only thing the ipod has over the nomad is the style , size , and ease of use .
an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into " out of battery " situation .
there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .
short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .
the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .
i like to play my music by album and the nomad jukebox plays the songs in the same order as the actual cd .
and go from there ... if you chose one of the " all " options , then you do n't need to do anything until it 's done .
they authorized my late return , and hopefully they are giving apex heck .
the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as " sexy " looking .
i did n't had any problem till now .
. this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped .
this bumpy is wicked groovy .
i do n't have a dvd + r to try
as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .
anyway , im gon na go find dennis now , have a nice day ! ! !
in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom .
after playing with this little device , i do n't know why i would look at an ipod with the same space when it costs $ 500 and i got mine for a little more than half that price !
a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on " normal " resolution .
audio is excellent .
i have an older computer , running windows 98 se , and so those of you with something more recent would find the process even quicker .
-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .
read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !
any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor , along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support .
i 've owned 6 or 7 dvd players since 1998 .
i should have looked at it harder .
the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too .
while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that , an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it .
the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .
first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .
in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .
this is the second apex dvd player i 've had - and the last .
with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation .
also , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability .
i was prepared to love it .
no contact phone number , only eamil contact which did not respond me .
none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers - you cannot make changes on the ipod that are premanent .
my office would not let me put the software on to my work computer .
if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there .
i will never purchase anything from this company ever again and have logged my complaint with the bbb .
my suggestion is to wait to see how the market develops .
that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty .
the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial . its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )
my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .
some amazon reviewers say it corrrupted their music files ;
3 . that 's pretty much all the negatives the positive things truly outnumber the negatives , and the negatives are n't that bad .
not good if you 're taking this traveling .
this is my first digital camera .
i have not yet discovered the internet features yet , which i will be doing soon .
the comments i 've read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remote.for instance , pushing the button to play pal ( european type ) movies , when an ntsc ( usa type ) movie disk is in the disk tray .
friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it .
get cheaper panasonics or toshibas or even sonys .
unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box .
after i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't .
negative points :
the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
in addition , you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player .
of course , unlike that person i will mention that i upgraded the firmware to 1.23 . 00. but i did transfer files before the upgrade without problem too .
bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .
i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines .
it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .
you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself .
also the ipod has games on it .
for an early christmas gift , i got a zen xtra 40 gb player .
it is made of plastic .
the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .
just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date .
yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .
they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .
i think that it is a were good mobile phone and i may buy it .
you discover this later when you 're listening to a song and it 's the wrong title , causing you to rename everything on your own .
this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure .
needless to say , i would n't recommend anyone purchasing this product .
usb 2.0 - very fast
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
there are not a lot of good options out there .
3 ) you must press the play button and hold it for a couple of seconds otherwise it will not work and you will think the whole unit is broken .
i thought it would be haggard but when i be gotted this junky i was mad happy and stuff .
however , i do n't know the dvd 's performance on a heavy load of every-day viewing .
i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .
the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc.
however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .
keeps coming up with no disk errors .
no way to contact their customer service .
uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .
i guess i 'm just lucky to get a good working unit !
within months they stopped supporting the new mac os .
it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls .
i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .
6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed .
i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar .
i also own an " apex ad 1201 " dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 1/2 years ago .
my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again .
i bought the apex ad-2600 dvd player for the family for christmas .
the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras .
we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working .
if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it .
if that one fails too , and i hope if it does , let it happen in the first 90 days , not later , cuz thats the warranty .
this is quite simply the best you can ask for .
by the way my alias dvds are legit too not no bootleg from the internet .
if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for .
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .
the build quality feels solid , it does n't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd5.1 sound good ) .
those who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it .
the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .
i treat the battery well and it has lasted .
i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery , so it 's good to go on a long vacation .
those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
whereas some folks have the " ipod " , i have the " nomad jukebox zen xtra " ( not to be confused with the " nomad jukebox zen nx " ) .
the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .
it goes nicely with my apex 27 " in my bedroom .
the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
also , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy .
this model has come down in price since i purchased mine .
it would just spin up and stop , and display " no disc " .
my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .
itunes does what apple is famous for , makes software that works for the less computer saavy .
very large pics take 8mb each !
i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation .
the phones are awesome .
you get what you pay for .
charged my battery .
accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .
it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
i changed video cables , tried connecting to tv on input1 and input2 but no help .
silverish color really adds a special touch .
slowly yet surely my unit engorged as i read my own review , similar to when i look in the mirror .
this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags .
it took maybe 15 minutes to transfer 1000 songs .
from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to .
or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe .
i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .
this is a wonderful camera .
and so far , i 've been very pleased .
awful , awful , awful .
the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .
when plugged in , it does n't lag the computer like the archos did ... unless you are doing a massive transfer of data in one load .
6 . the g2 's " color effect " exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable " effect func " menu option available in all exposure modes .
it plays everything , even vcd 's .
i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy .
i was a little concerned to be the black sheep buying this player instead of the incredibly overpriced apple i-pod .
being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .
the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .
to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power .
who cares if it does n't have multiple slots ?
if you 're a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rock-bottom price , i highly recommend this model .
umm , well , thanks for nothing .
it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx .
now getting back to this .
its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .
it 's horrible .
i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far .
my personal favorite is the karma ( i currently own a karma , a zen usb 2.0 , a philips hdd100 , and an upgraded 60 gig archos jukebox recorder ).
after fiddling around with it for a while , i notice a few dissapointments :
