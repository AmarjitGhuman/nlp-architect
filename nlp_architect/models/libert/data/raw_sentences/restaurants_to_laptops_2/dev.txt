I 've been a PC user and I just finally switched and I am never going back .
PDF files can be viewed instantly .
So what if the laptops/mobile phones look chic and cool ? The after sales support is terrible .
About 2 months ago i bought the 2011 macbook pro , which was an upgrade from my 2010 macbook pro .
I 've had a Toshiba laptop in the past ;
They removed them and returned the computer to me .
Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac .
Other than that I do n't have one complaint in the world !
the speed is fine .
Also is portable and reliable .
I also wanted Windows 7 , which this one has .
This is a great machine !
None of the techs at HP knew what they were doing .
The Awesomest of the awesomest .
I had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity , because it is very sensitive .
The most amazing part to me as a PC user is the startup and shutdown times - and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing .
It completely supports my home business and personal life .
I took the computer into Best Buy where I purchased it and they kept it over night to study it .
The only thing that I have , is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters , would help if it was a little lighter then it is .
It doesnt work worth a damn .
Microsoft seems to be unable to keep up with repairs for the multitude of windows problems .
Thanks for the fast shipment and great price .
The processor screams , and because of the unique way that Apple OSX 16 functions , most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software .
Who could n't love a DVD burner , 80-gigabyte HD , and fairly new graphics chip ? As I soon discovered , though , there is a reason for which similarly-configured Sony and Toshiba machines cost more : they use higher-quality components that are faster , better-configured , and end up lasting a lot longer .
This is a nicely sized laptop with lots of processing power and long battery life .
It 's great for streaming video and other entertainment uses .
Sent unit back and it 's been two months .
Images can be multi-selected and viewed swiftly or in slideshow mode .
The only problems are the sound isnt very loud I have to wear headphones .
HP is more interested in selling extended warranties ( which cost more than the netbook new ) then they are in helping or fixing .
If you want more information on macs I suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications .
It has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard !
I managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me .
If you want more information on macs I suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications .
It also comes with 4G of RAM but if you 're like me you want to max that out so I immediately put 8G of RAM in her and I 've never used a computer that performs better .
So happy with this purchase , I just wish it came with Microsoft Word .
The apple MacBook is the best investment that I have ever made .
The Nortons virus scan is only for a very short time unlike others that usually are good for a year .
I only used it to browse the internet and and I dont know how many times it has spontaniously shut down and it is just a blank screen now .
It came alot faster than I thought it would have which was really exciting .
My hp G60-244dx died after only 16 months .
Great , quick laptop for the money .
Not good for a person who gets online daily .
I have owned many computers and laptops .
Although I opted for the lowest end MacBook Pro , this thing holds its own .
It is small enough to fit in one of my purses !
The price and features more than met my needs .
I play a lot of casual games online , and the touchpad is very responsive .
Apple hit a home run here .
This MacBook is an outstanding product with great value .
This laptop meets every expectation and Windows 7 is great !
Shiny This Laptop is the Best of the best !
Small and still VERY powerful .
This computer gets very hot , before shutting down .
The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box , all the functions works great .
If you can afford a new laptop , and are in the market for one , of course , then definitely go for this .
Other than that , I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities .
It ca n't get any better .
This is my first computer purchase
The graphics and screen are stunning and although I was a PC person , I was able to understand how to use a mac fairly quickly .
The online tutorial videos make it super easy to learn if you have always used a PC .
i think that anyone looking for a good durrable laptop then this is the way to go .
Everything else just install and go .
No startup disk was not included but that may be my fault .
The layout of the MacBook is horrible and confusing ;
My only disappointment with the 13 " model is that they 're the only ones in the MacBook Pro line up without an i5 or i7 processor and dual graphics cards , however the trade-off is that you achieve a longer battery life ( of about 2 more hours ) .
It is extremely portable and easily connects to WIFI at the library and elsewhere .
I also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad .
Being a PC user for many years to switch to a Mac I will not go back .
Enough said .
Best Buy Rocks !
Still not bad for 220.00 .
Get this instead , you wo n't be sorry .
This is my first personal Satellite purchase but had very good experience through previous Satellite work issued laptops .
It is much faster than my desktop which is a Core2 Quad running at 2.83 GHz .
At first when I got this product , I loved it .
it is very easy for anyone to use an apple and specially the mcbook pro notebook .
I should have spent an extra hundred bucks and got a full sized computer .
I also had a problem with the touchpad that caused the mouse pointer to jump all over the screen .
I would highly recommend this one to my friends
I previously owned an older Dell laptop that died after about 5 or 6 years .
Runs very smoothly .
I purchased an HP right after my high school graduation .
I had less problems .
The only bad part is the size/weight .
The service tech said he had tried to duplicate the damage and was n't able to recreate it therefore it had to be their defect .
Returned laptop for a 4th repair and it came back but now would lock up and randomly reboot frequently making the laptop unusable .
Even if you do n't do business , thats okay , it 's incredibly fast .
Maybe it 's Acer , maybe it 's MSFT .
I hate it .
oh yeah , and if the fancy webcam breaks guess who you have to send it to to get it fixed ?
The only thing I miss are the " Home/End " type keys and other things that I grew accustomed to after so long .
I investigated netbooks and saw the Toshiba NB305-N410BL .
The display is awesome .
Very light and easily maneuverable .
After purchasing this thing , I find out that I need a special interface device to connect my camera , and that it can not be purchased at the store - only on line .
Our Apple 13.3 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer ( Z0J80001 ) Notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking .
It doesnt overheat or make any loud noises .
Finally , I could n't take it anymore and ordered my Apple .
Looks nice , but has a horribly cheap feel .
Super light , super sexy and everything just works .
I was n't really as concerned about portability ( it 's a very large laptop ) but it 's not hard to move around or take on a trip which was a pleasant surprise .
The feel of this is better than the Toshiba , too .
I always swore by PCs and would never consider a MAC .
I only wish this mac had a CD/DVD player built in .
I never tried any external mics with that iMac .
overall i would recomend this to anybody and tell them that if they want to burn their music or play there video games to buy the cd drive .
I thought that it will be fine , if i do some settings .
Its good for playing my apps on Facebook or watching movies .
I love this program , it is superior to windows movie maker .
They sent it off and within 2 weeks I had it back good as new .
But other than that I am blown away by all the features this laptop offers .
Soft touch , anodized aluminum with laser cut precision and no flaws .
In fact I still use manyLegacy programs ( Appleworks , FileMaker Pro , Quicken , Photoshop etc ) !
It is extremely user friendly and intuitive .
( The SATA controller is the motherboard chip that lets the CPU talk to the hard drive . )
Let me start with the good : So awesome .
Have had many higher priced computers crash and burn long before ever got to use all that great memory and speed , etc .
And Toshiba is a quality supplier .
Quick and has built in virus control .
I am paying apple to kill my self and my wallet .
It really is perfect for work and play .
But I did n't want to spend another thousand on a laptop since my work already provides me with a PC .
It was a total Dhell experience that I will never repeat .
The advantages of owning ' a ' mac are numerous .
The Aspire wont even boot past the Acer screen with a Droid ( I have tried both Motorola and HTC ) plugged into the USB port .
Really great ... Well let me start at the beginning .
It was returned on the third day I owned it .
Mac also has many apps and programs that are quite cheap or free .
I understand I should call Apple Tech Support about any variables ( which is my purpose of writing this con ) as variables could be a bigger future problem .
Took several hours with customer support before I could even start the PC out of the box .
however , I may have inadvertently thrown out one of the batteries with the shipping carton .
One , owning a mac is essentially a full production studio ( in the case of a mac book a portable version ) .
The graphics were awful and the warranty is n't even worth the cheap payment on the computer .
The track pad is a bit squirrely at times - sometimes too sensitive , and sometimes a bit unresponsive , but it 's usable .
The laptop was returned but audio issue was not fixed .
Further , this Mac Mini has a sloppy Bluetooth interface ( courtesy of the Mac OS ) and the range is poor .
They definitely have a superior product !
The durability of the laptop will make it worth the money .
tosiba has a good reputation , my llast computer was an acer .
I had to pay $ 100 for a universal charger for this cheap $ 300 laptop .
This causes my wrist to scrape up against it .
I believe that the quality of a mac is worth the price .
My husband purchased a laptop at the same time for about $ 300 less ( he got a pc ) .
WHEN TYPING , LETTERS AND SPACES ARE FREQUENTLY OMITTED REQUIRING THE USER TO REDO MANY WORDS AND SENTENCES .
Hopefully Amazon will take this back .
I love the keyboard .
Here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing .
Have used only Macs for years .
I am replacing the HD with a Micron SSD soon .
I did a review on it , its awesome .
Everything I wanted and everything I needed and the price was great !
My computer was one of the best in the school compared to my fellow classmates .
It was always getting froze up .
There is nothing better .
Its pretty fast and does not have hiccups while I am using it for web browsing , uploading photos , watching movies ( 720p ) on occasion and creating presentations .
The only thing I would change about it is the mouse keys .
Its fast , easy to use and it looks great .
The only downfall is the volume control .
What can I say , It 's an Apple .
Love that it does n't take up space like a regular computer .
- Stay away from Apple , or hope you laptop does not break down .
I 've only had it one day , but I really do love it and I 'm happy it was economical and I 'm finally able to own a Mac !
When I am next to my router on my HP I get full service , on my Eee PC I get 3 bars .
I fell in love with it .
The fact that you can spend over $ 100 on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine .
Whenever tried to turn it on , it would restart as soon as the BIOS launched Windows ( or Winblows , as I like ot call it ) .
I could n't be more pleased .
I was looking for something in between a regular laptop and a tablet and this is it .
I had in the past a Dell laptop and they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair technician to my house to fix it .
But , for the cost this is a winner .
Also , I have had alot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines .
i FINALLY DID IT AND THIS MACHINE IS THE WAY TO GO !
Best Buy ended up junking the computer and giving me a replacement computer .
I asked how they would determine that since there are no scratches , dents or other signs of damage and was told that was the only way this type of damage could happen .
Wasted me at least 8 hours of installation time .
The sound was crappy even when you turn up the volume still the same results .
We do n't Mind and You do n't Matter .
Could n't have asked for more !
even though I had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty .
Dell Latitude d620 is not a reliable machine .
And mine had broke but I sent it in under warranty-no problems .
Once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts .
It has no camera but , I can always buy and install one easy .
I worked in IT retail sales before .
Received all four in good order ;
I simply got tired of a bad computer like windows with its constant freezing and anti-virus .
company provides UPS shipping , fast , great !
Yes , I thought the expese was a little much , but I now realize you get what you pay for .
We did n't because it was already over 2,400 dollars !
My son said it popped up and he clicked update .
I 'm very impressed .
Yes , I have it on the highest available setting .
The new MacBook is lightyears ahead of my old white plastic MacBook circa 2006 .
so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop .
I 've owned this labtop for less then two months , already the mouse button has broke .
I got the first " Blue screen of death " in the early part of July .
STOPPED BOOTING UP less than a week after my one-year warranty was up .
Its white color is stylish for college students and easy to take to carry and take to classes .
- Apparently , contactus@euro.apple.com is not a good address to send complaints .
The only thing I did n't learn in my research was the software I would need like privacy protection and warranty protection , in case it gets broken , or crashes etc .
I really wish I had done this years ago .
Page just disapeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something .
Enjoy using Microsoft Office !
- Apple offers to send replacement and after 10 days I send them the old computer .
Now , I guess , I 'll have to unload my M6809 on some poor , hapless soul .
I had never owned a Mac before ;
The only thing I dislike is the touchpad , alot of the times its unresponsive and does things I dont want it too , I would recommend using a mouse with it .
i try to use it today and I ca n't logon .
Thank you so much for the great item .
It pretty much does everything we could ever need , and looks great to boot .
I use it now more than I even thought I would .
Both my husband and I have this model Toshiba .
I have found it very easy to use , very imformative , wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs .
But it may be potentially hundreds or thousands in the near future .
After paying several hundred dollars for this service , it is frustrating that you can not get help after hours .
I 'm extremely happy with my purchase as I now have the portable power I have been looking for .
Completely worth every single penny dime and nickel .
You may just lose 1 customer for now .
Overall : Poor , Features : Average , Performance : Poor , Battery Life : Excellent , Price-Value : Poor
I WANT MY L505-s5988 BACK !
i have dropped mine a couple times with only a slim plastic case covering it .
This comes in very handy for me as an educator .
YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET FOR .
do a quick search on the internet see if im the only one .
Avoid this model .
- got it back 3 months later
Have returned that laptop unused .
It wakes in less than a second when I open the lid .
Moral of the story : - Do not buy anything from companies that do not respect their customers .
They transfer you around to other people who do not understand what you are saying and you ca n't understand what they are saying .
I also purchased iWork to go with it which has programs for word processing , spreadsheets , and presentations ( similar to Microsoft Office ) .
power supply went bad after 2 weeks --
But after using it a couple of weeks , the overall operation is poor .
I did n't like one thing about it .
I 've been having endless problems since I bought the computer - only 1 month ago
I tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and I still have the same problem .
I could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage .
We 'll save our money to replace it with a Mac again !
They are about the same size keys .
I 'm already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown .
You will need them if you want to reload the OS ( I recommend doing if you can to start fresh and optimal ) .
To this day , there are NONE .
BEST BUY - 5 STARS + + + ( sales , service , respect for old men who are n't familiar with the technology ) DELL COMPUTERS - 3 stars DELL SUPPORT - owes a me a couple
I love the Mac so much better than my work PC !
I 've always owned a PC and decided to try a MacBook to see what it 's all about .
i have tried to charge on different batteries with no luck .
Mac is not made for gaming .
So , I must say I am not a happy camper .
While I mostly use it for email , internet and gaming , I 'm confident all other applications live up to the high standard I 've come to appreciate from Mac laptops .
I can guarantee this will be the last Dell I will ever purchase !
without having to have extra equipment and/or complicated routes to take to be able to do so .
Added an iMac about 2 years later .
It just works flawlessly !
After replacing the spinning hard disk with an ssd drive , my mac is just flying .
But for those of you that dont have a mac and are still on the PC 's this is a good foot in the door into mac .
It gets stuck all of the time you use it , and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work .
I have had my MacBook for almost 6 months and can honestly say that I will NEVER buy another computer if it is not a Mac .
And I can attach my projector to it .
We purchase the Dell XPS several years ago for my home business .
Best Buy was great as always and accepted the return and gave me another model 1764 .
In summary , take your money elsewhere .
In the shop , these MacBooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure - so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it , get it home , break the seal and use it ( very clever con ) .
Here are the things that made me confident with my purchase : Build Quality - Seriously , you ca n't beat a unibody construction .
The programs are great , like iphoto ( love the editing capabilities ) , imail ( which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad ) , imovie , etc .
It is BLAZING fast !
Shipping was quick and product described was the product sent and so much more ...
If you already own a 2009 , 2010 , or early 2011 model , you should wait until the next update .
I spoke to 4 different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a 5th person !
It is easy to use , has great screen quality , and every so light weight .
My power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership , so it was covered by the Applecare warranty plan .
this laptop is great for work and doing my pictures .
Very nice so far .
And if you do a lot of writing , editing is a problem since there is no forward delete key .
Yeah , to you .
My first laptop was an Acer that I got for Christmas .
From the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer !
But you must get the 15 inch .
They were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place .
I saw the Mini Mac at Best Buy and decided to get this as my replacement .
As a graphic arts a retired instructor I still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art .....
Nothing wrong with this computer at all !
I looked at the computer and it said updating but the asked for a product key .
Well , maybe I was just very unlucky .
Good bye BLUE SCREEN and Critical errors !!!!
Its worth every Penny .
I have used a computer at work but having your own personal laptop is AWSOME !
Since I purchased my Toshiba netbook , I have been very pleased with it , I have a laptob and a desktop .
I spoke with a service rep at Micro Center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her power adapter , so it 's not just an isolated incident !!!
We also use Paralles so we can run virtual machines of Windows XP Professional , Windows 7 Home Premium , Windows Server Enterprise 2003 , and Windows Server 2008 Enterprise .
Either way the entire thing was just a joke , a complete rip off !
When I got it , I immediately noticed that it was quite heavy and thick and not really attractive .
it has had some problems .
That is pretty sad when they name them specifically .
It 's a joke .
the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer , left right and front .
They 're absolutely useless , unless you count the joy of releasing anger while smashing into little peices against the wall .
Everything is so easy to use , Mac software is just so much simpler than Microsoft software .
This was a gift for my grand son .
Seems like maybe a bad shipment from Toshiba .
Never been hacked .
No installation disk ( DVD ) is included .
While Apple 's saving grace is the fact that they at least stand behind their products , and their support is great , it would be nice if their products were more reliable to justify the premium .
The one thing I wish it had was a detailed hardcopy manuel .
Everything was up and running within 15 minutes of unboxing .
Even so , I like playing online games , so it was wonderful that there is a feature where I can dualboot Windows .
The screen is a little glary , and I hated the clicking buttons , but I got used to them .
I love this piece of equipment , It will be hard to go back to other type of laptop after using a MacBook Pro .
Not enough time for me to give it 5 stars !
I had always used PCs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive .
I have been a PC user since middle school , but in my mid twenties I decided to convert to the dark side , or should I say the brighter side of life .
Other Thoughts : Do not purchase this product .
BOUGHT FROM WAL-MART , I BELIEVE THAT THIS LAPTOP WAS A REPAIRED ITEM .
I wish I would have taken the plunge years ago .
I love this 13 " Mac white unibody .
I could have purchased a cheap computer to do what I 'm doing now !
Fast , great visual !
The 13 " Macbook Pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to CA this is the best price we can get for a great product .
They are closed at 9pm eastern .
Stay away from Envy .
The most recent being that my Safari internet browser is freaking out on me , but I have just been using firefox instead .
For the use it was purchased for it is a good Laptop .
If you do n't feel comfortable doing it yourself , just buy the case and be happy , plus it looks nice , I bought the white one from Best Buy .
First , it does not have a push button to open the lid .
The AC power port becomes loose over time
Because he said that the hinge is under the motherboard and they have to dismantle the whole thing before it can be tightened .
It works exactly like it did the day I took it out of the box .
Posted Nov 8 , 2010 - Two weeks ago I bought this notebook .
but in resume this computer rocks !
Boots up fast and runs great !
Note that I do n't ordinarily take the time to write a review .
The processor a AMD Semprom at 2.1 ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for HD or heavy computing .
This was purchased for my daughter and I was pleasantly surprised .
In short , you could say your mac could become your best friend ( no intention of replacing Rover your dog ) .
Buy this .
It did n't take me long to get switched over to the Mac computer programs and navigation - it 's been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better .
Thank you Best Buy for putting my computer together and installing my first software - you guys were GREAT too !
This is my second MACBOOK PRO and it 's better than ever .
Next , most Acer laptop fans are on the bottom which is right on your laptop .
It is quiet and a real joy to watch work .
That 's right , no power , absolutely NOTHING .
Well designed and fast .
The benefits were immediate !
As a computer science student in college , I find that the portability , longevity , and ease of use of this computer make me ( shockingly ) want to do homework more ;
It is just slow slow slow .
I would recommend to any one lloking for a first class computer !
Then the system would many times not power down without a forced power-off .
This is what I call a good after sales service .
This laptop has only 2 USB ports , and they are both on the same side .
Even out of warranty !
The materials that came with the computer did not include the right # anywhere .
It just works out of the box and you have a lot of cool software included with the OS .
Finally , the biggest problem has been tech support .
2 . The wireless card is low quality .
I like it better than my big Dell Laptop .
LOVE THIS LAPTOP WONDERFUL PRICE FOR WHAT YOU GET !
I charge it at night and skip taking the cord with me because of the good battery life .
Waited on getting this computer , but it has been a great change .
You have to toss out the wifi card and replace it just to have any sort of network capability .
It has good speed and plenty of hard drive space .
After 5 months of failed repairs , requested a full refund but was refused and it still is not repaired and Acer is indifferent to the issue .
I can do everything I could before , only faster and more efficiently .
Recommended to people as their first laptop .
I 'm having the laptop returned unrepaired since paying $ 176 every 3 months just is n't worth it ( that 's about how long the port seems to last ) .
when i first got it i thought the size of it was a joke .
Asus facial recognition does n't work and windows logon is n't either .
Sorry , newegg .
working with Mac is so much easier , so many cool features .
I had meant to purchase the NB205 and bought this one by accident ( long story ) .
lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small .
I Have been a Pc user for a very long time now but I will get used to this new OS .
It is easy to navigate and update programs .
taking notes , research , an online class and such and did n't want to spend too much on my first machine .
It 's A MAC !!
I loved it then , but unfortunately it was before the days of wireless internet .
The only thing that I do n't like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that I want to be able to run and I am not able to .
And inconvenient !
I am totally satisfied with my little toshie !
So far , so good .
Starts up in a hurry and everything is ready to go .
Though please note that sometimes it crashes , and the sound quality isnt superb .
Sadly Apple has discontinued this MacBook , I think it was never super popular since it fell somewhere in between the cheapest white model and the smaller Pros .
Do n't get me wrong , I am no Microsoft hater , I 've just managed to turn into a much bigger Apple fan because of this machine .
That was a big mistake .
I was so happy with my new Mac .
That is how it is able to function better than any other PC .
The Macbook Pro is extremely thin and light compared to those heavy Windows Laptop .
I have owned at least 4 to 5 laptops and computers - but this is by far the most superior machine I have ever owned .
The battery life also does n't keep up with the claim but still I think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack .
Great Laptop for the price , works well with action pack games .
And the screen on this thing is absolutely amazing for high quality videos and movies and gaming .
Nothing bad to say about it .
I ca n't imagine my life without it anymore !
Even set at the highest level , the computer sacrifices its queen every time .
Sure it 's not light and slim but the features make up for it 100 % .
Only a few days after I received the computer back , the screen froze again .
Screen - although some people might complain about low res which I think is ridiculous .
? I am only interested in the 15.4 McBook Pro Model # MD103LL/A
The Toshiba Net book operates very well .
Shipped very quickly and safely .
When I am at Starbucks between clients I get full bars on my HP and 1 bar on my Eee PC .
I 'm so disgusted that I wasted my money on this product .
I have no problems yet on my mac so far , and hope it stays like that .
All the above aside this machine ROCKS !
Out of all the laptops I have owned , this is by far the best !
and its really cheap and you wont regret buying it .
The latest is on my LG Netbook X12
My MacBook Pro works like a dream , it has never overheated , or even been slightly warm for that matter .
The cool thing about this is anyone can use it .
ca n't reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary hardware drivers .
More relieved than anything .
I did swap out the hard drive for a Samsung 830 SSD which I highly recommend .
So far it has been five months since the last problem was fixed and I am PRAYING it has finally stopped .
* = Webcam is a bit laggy , not the greatest .
Price and purpose is awesome !
If you have much higher expectations than that ... I would look elsewhere .
There are several programs for school or office use ( Pages , Numbers , Keynote , etc. ) , music ( Garageband ) , photo management ( Photo Booth , iPhoto ) , video-editing or movie-making ( iMovie ) , etc .
It is easy to use , fast and has great graphics for the money .
The only issue came when I tried scanning to the mac .
My husband uses it mostly for games , email and music .
I fell in love with the hp pavillion and that was my replacement and now I could not imagine going back to an acer at all .
This is my 3rd Apple Laptop and first MacBook Pro .
My previous purchases were with Dell and HP .
It was over rated !
Biggest complaint is Windows 8 .
For me , keys were starting to get stuck and would n't type very well .
Be sure to have good air flow where ever you put it .
If someone called me an Apple Fanboy ... it would make sense .
I respond that I do not have the old computer and this way I would lose the data on my hard drive .
you will not regret it , promise you !
I bought it to use in college and it is perfect .
I should have bought one a long time ago .
They freeze all the time .
This laptop is very large and barely fits in any carrying cases .
I am able to play 720p and 1080p media files just fine with it .
Now , , , , , my monitor has been acting up for about 2 months .
This by far beats any computer out on the market today built well , battery life AMAZING .
As with any laptop not purchased with software options , it comes with a lot of what I consider useless applications .
The computer blinks it shuts off at will .
Very fast for my needs .
Well , maybe more like week one .
I am also upset with CR for giving a good rating .
I took it back to Best Buy where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a new one .
I upgraded it 's RAM to 2GB , I am very happy with it .
That included the extra Sony Sonic Stage software , the speakers and the subwoofer I got ( that WAS worth the money ) , the bluetooth mouse for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer , the extended life battery and the Docking port .
It made the computer much easier to use and navigate .
I 'm tired of the inept service .
I am a freelance graphic artist .
If upgrade is possible to the full Windows 7 , then I will truly be a very happy geek .
So this is very good commputer and i highly suggest it .
Be safe buy a Sony .
This is my second MacBook .
1st hand experience is very important , especially for a new customer .
All of the programs ( Keynote , Pages , Numbers ) have an option to save your documents as Microsoft compatible , which really eliminates the need for the actual .
I am please with the products ease of use ; out of the box ready ; appearance and functionality .
With notes saying they replaced the hard drive .
I was WRONG !
Being virus-resistant is a huge plus .
and they replaced the awesome ergonomic small lightweight power supply with a power supply that weighed more than the machine itself .
Which I still use and have hooked up to my TV .
The price was very good , and the product is top quality .
I hope to edit this in the next few hours , I am going to try to install my own copy of Windows 7 .
Apple did a great job .
I am not much of a computer techie , so I can understand some of the internal problems , though I do have trend micro as an antiviral program .
I have used different laptops in the past and I have to rate this one way above the rest .
I should have sent it back to them then .
I have had to send in my laptop three times to get it fixed .
I love a " pc " but I was ready for a change and tired of the windows system .
Sad very SAD .
Before , I reloaded with Windows 7 Ultimate and used only the downloaded drivers from Acer 's site .
The programs that come standard with the Leopard running system are enough for the average person to run all the basics .
The macbook pro is really responsive .
That includes transferring my music and movies .
They would repair one thing , send it back and it would still have the same problem .
This is the first time that I tried and owning a netbook although I have used 3 different laptops in the past 10 years , I find not much difference except of course for the screen size .
I would say that 85 % of the design industry is Mac for good reason .
Its also FUN to use !
fast , great screen , beautiful apps for a laptop ; priced at 1100 on the apple website ; amazon had it for 1098 + tax - plus i had a 10 % off coupon from amazon-cost me 998 plus tax - 1070 - OTD !
I paid for extra memory and the 17-inch screen , as well as the top of the line DVD and CD burners .
HOWEVER I chose two day shipping and it took over a week to arrive .
I get a ton of compliments on its size , and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus , I can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you 're restricted to the width of your body for computing room .
NO more Lenovo for me .
All for such a great price .
Many of my classmates computers hard drives crashed .
Then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running .
Also stunning colors and speedy
After a couple of years , my battery life began to diminish but was replaced for free due to a company-wide recall of my particular battery .
It still works and it 's extremely user friendly , so I would recommend it for new computer user and also for those who are just looking for a more efficient way to do things
Overall I feel this netbook was poor quality , had poor performance , although it did have great battery life when it did work .
Images are crisp and clean .
I had to re-install Windows within two weeks of the purchase and soon discovered cracks in the screen hinges .
Does a great job with video shot on a Canon 5D MKII .
Tech support tells me the latter problem is a power supply problem and have offered to fix it if it happens again .
I love everything about it .
Love it so far .
I love everything about this computer .
I upgraded from a 5 year old laptop and was amazed to find out that this computer is much slower then my old laptop .
I recently purchased the mini and absolutely love it !
I have found a lot of online sources to help me but think that I would have learned a lot quicker if I would have taken the class .
I got the Macbook and he got a Macbook Pro .
I own a Hewlett Packard laptop and I 've had man problems with it since I bought in in Feb , 201
I or my dad paid over twenty four hundred dollars for everything .
It is not even a year old yet , so I would definitely not recommend it to anyone .
Most everything is fine with this machine : speed , capacity , build .
It was slow , locked up , and also had hardware replaced after only 2 months !
Windows Vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service .
Also , I have alot of trouble with it getting very hot , and not even sitting on anything to make it hot .
I 'm glad it waited , this one is great .
While we struggle with all the crashes and viruses , the kids computers stay consistent and so we caved in and bought one for buisness !
I found this laptop on sale for under 6000 at Best Buy which was a great deal !
The first one sent : Touchpad did n't work The second sent : USB did n't work The third sent : Touchpad did n't work The fourth sent : Has n't arrived yet .
I just hope the reputation that Toshiba has is true and I wo n't have to worry about a crash .
It drives me crazy when I want to download a game or something of that nature and I ca n't play it because its not compatable with the software .
It 's so nice that the battery last so long and that this machine has the snow lion !
The only thing I do n't understand is that the resolution of the screen is n't high enough for some pages , such as Yahoo!Mail .
Screen size is perfect for portable use in any environment .
the laptop preformed pretty well .
For example , when my husband turns the light out while I 'm on the computer .
Good laptop for the money .
Which was way too much money .
I love the multi-touch trackpad .
I 'm definitely not hard on laptops and guarantee 100 % that no liquid has touched this machine in my presence .
This is what they told me : It heats up , and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops , and simply categorize them as portables .
It is a bit heavy .
The new operating system makes this computer into a super iPad .
Time will tell .
Again - windows based machines were not giving me anything to work with !
And it 's so quiet that I do n't hear it at all .
The only objection I have is that after you buy it the windows 7 system is a starter and charges for the upgrade .
I 'm honestly afraid that it will burn me , it 's that hot !
Never any doubt I would get a MacBook , just was n't sure which one .
That defeated the whole point of a laptop .
I took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one .
i must keep it plugged in at all times because it will not keep a charge for longer than four minutes .
After numerous calls to Applecare tech support , I was directed to send in my computer ;
very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent ...
This netbook went bad on me after 3 days .
OS X is solid with lots of innovations such as quicklook which save heaps of time .
Sony , Acer , Dell , Packard Bell and Toshiba .
I love the solid machined aluminum frame , and the keyboard is the best of any laptop I 've used .
The powerpoint opened seamlessly in the apple and the mac hooked up to the projector so easily it was almost scary .
Made interneting ( part of my business ) very difficult to maintain .
Unless you need the Bluetooth 3 .
Not to mention the fact that your mac comes fully loaded with all necessary basic programs .
* 3 weeks after giving the computer for repair * - Visited MacHouse Amsterdam .
I am still in the process of learning about its features .
C'mon , LG .
Much faster than my old windows laptop that died on me .
Again .
Mostly I love the drag and drop feature .
ASUS has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks , and I would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them .
Every driver on the drivers/applications DVD is everything you will need for a reload .
The first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours .
Its a pretty decent computer .
I love the size , keyboard , the functions .
Most of them were either too big , too noisy and too slow after 2 years .
It 's a lottery at this point as I have read that other have received new ones with the same problem .
I then upgraded to Mac OS X 10.8 " Mountain Lion " .
Now 17 months later they want ( would not say exact amount ) $ 165.00 to $ 400 to fix the machine .
A scratch on a $ 1,500 MacBook is unforgivable .
i love to use it it is esay and light .
Anyway , in early July of this year , the DVD burner stopped working , and the computer stared having issues with power supply .
Overall it 's an amazing product , 5 stars !
this one , in my opinion , might be a lemon !
It was loaded with Windows Vista Home Premium -- delivered with only 1GB of RAM , and it was a * dog * .
i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have .
My battery went bad about a year and a half after having it and it cost around eighty to a hundred dollars !
Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase .
this is starting off good .
Two of the times was in one month .
I did add a SSD drive and memory
Now that I have upgraded to Lion I am much happier about MAC OS and have just bought an iMac for office .
Its small enough where I can take it pretty much anywhere , but still has a big enough screen to get everything done .
This is a great little computer for the price .
I shipped out on Saturday , July 17 .
It was hard to handle and operate at school .
I 'm really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer .
While there are occasions that my computer will freeze or will need to be manually shut down , this occurs far less frequently than on PC computers and laptops that I 've used .
This laptop serves all my needs .
the size of has actually help me out quite a bit by me being able to fit it in an already full backpack and to use it at a resturant where the food on the table is always so space consuming .
I called back to ensure that received it , they had .
We have had numerous problems with Vista , such as Adobe Flash player just quits and has to be uninstalled and then reinsalled , Internet Explore just quits and you lose whatever you were working on , also , the same Windows update has appeared on this computer since we got it and has been updated probably 400 times , the same update .
When I got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct HP told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem .
I got assurances from 2 different people that the remaining 10 months of my warranty would transfer to the new computer .
Screen is crystal clear , yes it 's small - but it 's a netbook !
I connect a LaCie 2Big external drive via the firewire 800 interface , which is useful for Time Machine .
the mouse pad and buttons are the worst i 've ever seen .
I dislike the quality and the placement of the speakers .
Again , I sent it off to Acer , by this time they were paying for me to send it to them and everything , but it was still inconvienent because of my classes and my communication with my fiance .
I just love my Mac !
Externally the keys on my keyboard are falling off , after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit , and the screen has a terrible glare .
THIS IS MY SECOND MAC BOOK PRO .
Upgrading from Windows 7 Starter , thru Windows 7 Home Premium , to Windows 7 Professional was a snap ;
Speaking of the browser , it too has problems .
I think I might rather suffer for something that is simple to fix in my opinion .
No problems , no lock ups , no disappointments .
Had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in .
Good monitor and performed well .
I am having a friend look at it , but will probably return it .
Microsoft word was not on it andI had to buy it seperately .
I really like the Mac 15.4 in . Notebook , but its very pricey .
This laptop leaves alot to be desired , I have had it only 5 months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice ...
It 's graphics are n't bad at all , for the lower end of the MacBook Pro spectrum , easily capable of running StarCraft II and other games with comparable graphics .
It is also fast as can be ... you get what you pay for ... well worth the investment
The only thing that is n't perfect about this netbook is the speakers , they are not loud at all but I expected that .
I bought it during the recent Comex IT show .
Easy to set up and go !
It 's so much easier to navigate through the operating system , to find files , and it runs a lot faster !
You can read all about the details of this marvelous computer on wikipedia .
Fan only comes on when you are playing a game .
Instead of taking another chance on Toshiba , I went with an Asus G73JH-x3 .
It is very fast and has everything that I need except for a word program .
very very slow laptop .
Called tech support and got the usual Acer " We do n't support software but for $ $ $ we can help you " I explained there was no software involved in booting .
I want the portability of a tablet , without the limitations of a tablet and that 's where this laptop comes into play .
Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac .
Then just the other day , my left " mouse " button snapped !
I know that ASUS is known for making motherboards , but this is the worst computer experience that I have ever had .
The MBP is beautiful has many wonderful capabilities .
All the yada-yada .
Just keep in mind the graphics is not dedicated so loading the movie almost took a minute , but it ran fairly smooth for a non-dedicated graphics card .
Because it IS a defective product .
In short I would never buy a Compaq again .
I decided to buy a few notebooks for my nephews for Xmas .
This thing is a lemon .
But , buy this model and just purchase 4GB of RAM ( 2x2GB for $ 92 or 1x4GB for $ 99 ) , and save yourself $ 100 than the other model with 8GB of RAM .
When I called Toshiba , they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $ 35 for the phone call , even though they did n't offer any technical support .
I would buy one of these for every person in my office if I could .
One of the primary reasons why I purchased an IPad was to store photographs so that I could show to my customers .
the mouse on the pad , the left button always sticks .
It 's fast , quiet , incredibly small and affordable compared to other Mac models .
It is also very lightweight , making transporting this computer very easy .
I tell everyone I see out looking to get this or another Toshiba .
The OS takes some getting used to especially after being a Windows user for so long but the learning curve is so worth it !
If you faintly come close to touching this thing while typing , all craziness may break loose .
This computer was so challenging to carry and handle .
Plain and simple , it ( laptop ) runs great and loads fast .
Everything from the design to the OS is simple and to the point .
Some features arent friendly ( volume wheel , sound quality , etc .
It does not even have the software to play a dvd now .
it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once .
My main reason to convert was the imovie program .
" > iPhoto is probably the best program I have ever worked with : easy and convenient .
Mac computers automatically " defrag " each time you start your computer .
And the ram ( the thing that makes it faster ) comes sporting 2 gigs for high performance to handle more stuff at once and surf the web a whole lot faster than before .
You 'll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them .
It 's even easy to hook up to other wireless networks .
I tried giving it 0 stars but I had to choose at least one , but IMO NO STARS
All the things you can do with the trackpad make navigating around the computer and its programs so much simpler , quicker , and easier .
Gradually the freezing screen evolved into a screen that froze in weird shapes .
I love the Apple products .
Oh and if thats not bad enough it does n't come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $ 25 for two cds .
The size is perfect and I do not recomend anything bigger except for any person who can exceed the limited space it gives you .
But the machine is awesome and iLife is great and I love Snow Leopard X.
It is fast and i have not had a problem with internet connection or any other problems .
But until now , no complains at all .
Fine if you have a touch screen .
I 'm Very disappointed in Dell .
The only thing i can say is that the touch pad doesnt work like it should all the time .
The best thing to do is build your own computer , but if u ca n't company 's like dell who allow you to choose the components are better and for the same price you can get a computer who compares to one of apple $ 2000 systems and if you google " dell coupons " you can find codes that take a signifant amount off the price .
- When battery life went to 4 hours or less , took it to the MacHouse Amsterdam for repair ( 26th of August ) .
Startup in about 30 seconds , shutdown in 2-4 seconds , resume from sleep in 0-2 seconds .
This laptop is insane !!!
If only Bill Gates would read some of what is said here MS would do a better job .
If that is the case , then I am completely happy
Very disappointed with Apple .
Runs smooth and quick .
The Like New condition of the iMac MC309LL/A on Amazon is at $ 900 + level only , and it is a Quad-Core 2.5 GHz CPU ( similar to the $ 799 Mini ) , with Radeon HD 6750M 512MB graphic card ( this mini is integrated Intel 4000 card ) , and it even comes with wireless Apple Keyboard and Mouse , all put together in neat and nice package .
If you need an affordable , entry-level laptop , this will fit the bill .
I think part of the problem with this computer is Vista , yet I know Vista is n't the entire issue because my latest purchase was my Acer and it also has Vista ( I should have waited the few months to get the next operating system ) .
Then after paying for it to be examined I was told it was same problem cited on website but I 'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty .
When you call tech support you were routed to someone who was in another country and did not know what they were doing .
So honestly , I was n't expecting anything less than perfection , and I was n't disappointed .
The battery life , before the battery completely died of course , left much to be desired .
All in all , I 'm incredibly dissatisfied with this laptop , and with HP as a whole .
And if you are a game player it works with World Of Warcraft wonderfully .
I will stack it up against laptops that cost twice as much any day .
They say sorry out of warranty .
Needs longer lasting battery , More than 1 to 2 Hrs .
A great college tool !
I had to have these computers in my school .
The Toshiba Mini Notebook , Model NB 305-N410BL , is a great little computer .
So having the AC plug go out on me and get lose or I could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good .
I also own an HP notebook and it does n't even come close .
Supplied software : The software that comes with this machine is greatly welcomed compared to what Windows comes with .
Incredible graphics and brilliant colors .
Cheaper than buying it @ apple too !
Also consider the MS Office apps are all trial versions , hope you have your own copies .
I purchased a MacBook Pro and this to replace a couple of HP units that I was using .
No waiting to have my claim reviewed by someone in another state ( or more often , another country ) .
It is good to know that I can mobilize without having to worry about the battery life .
The cons are more annoyances that can be lived with .
If I have a few hundred dollars to spare , I 'd buy the Pro line though , the 2.53 and 2.66 GHz model .
Was n't sure if I was going to like it much less love it so I went to a local best buy and played around with the IOS system on a Mac Pro and it was totally unique and different .
The speakers could have been better but it was n't a deal breaker ... this is a great little laptop ... love it !
I bought a Logitech desktop set in anticipation for using with the MBP , but I use the touchpad 90 % of the time .
I was loving this Netbook because it had an amazing screen and display and was small and light , but after 1 week it stopped openning web pages for me ( even after installing new browsers ) then eventually it just started giving me a blue screen and crashing everytime I booted it .
HP said I had done the damage .
I 'm new - just switched from years of PC frustration .
Bottom line , I doubt you 'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine .
I do everything on this computer - check email , facebook , shop , check blogs , write papers , listen to music , and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv .
I can actually get work done with this MAC , and not fight with it like my tired old PC laptop .
It is really easy to use and it is quick to start up .
The case is carved out of a single block of aluminum .
I constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed .
It weighed like seven pounds or something like that .
However , the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary ( unless you 're gaming ) .
However , If I sound enthusiastic about this , I am !
I did not like my acer .
I bought my macbook a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since .
Obviously one of the most important features of any computer is the " human interface .
If you shop around in the current market you can find a much better deal .
still testing the battery life as i thought it would be better , but am very happy with the upgrade .
What a waste .
When it come time for warranty service to Toshiba you do n't matter .
Anyways I bought this two months ago and when I first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone .
I would never tell anyone to buy one either .
I burned my leg , after lifting it from my desk , and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table , so I can place it there .
Still pretty pricey , but I 've been putting off money for a while as a little Macbook Fund , and finally got to use it .
It really is very light compared to other computers .
Battery life needs more life .
Can you buy any laptop that matches the quality of a MacBook ?
Great value , fast delivery - Computer works as if brand new , no problems , very pleased
I am so happy to have purchased this computer .
No luck , although I waited for hours on the phone-Visited MacHouse , they stated the their call center is down due to too many phonecalls ( difficult to believe ) .
I was given a Mac as a birthday present and could n't be happier with it 3 years later .
All I can say is I am impressed .
HOW DOES THE POWER SUPPLY NOT WORK !!!
The MacBook Pro is a great product which can meet the needs of the average consumer .
Clearly , there is something wrong with the product and LG did n't take up the responsibility .
My MacBook is faster than any comparable PC .
I sent it back AND THEY LOST IT .
THis computer may be small but it is one heck of a power horse .
If you are looking for a netbook pc DO NOT BUY FROM ASUS !!!
It is not an easy decision to purchase a used or even good as new laptop but I am very satisfied .
it is the worst computer dell ever made .
The computer is a dream come true .
In the past few years , I 've had terrible experiences with HP .
It is her first laptop and she is thrilled .
The MAC Mini , wireless keyboard / mouse and a HDMI cable is all I need to get some real work done .
I am loyal to Apple .
You wo n't have to spend gobs of money on some inefficient virus program that needs to be updated every month and that constantly drains your wallet .
I BOUGHT THEM FOR MY COLLEGE AGE GRANDCHILDREN AND THESE MACS ARE TOTALLY RELIABLE AND SUPPORT THEIR CLASS WORK 100 % OF THE TIME .
and if u did .
It caught a virus that completely wiped out my hard drive in a matter of hours .
Accordingly , I have decided to NEVER purchase another HP product ( my five year old Compaq ) lasted 5-years before the hard drive crashed .
When the computer has been on for several minutes , it will occasionaly just go off by itself .
I took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it .
In all honesty , if someone is looking for a quality laptop and willing to pay a little more money for a normal sized laptop than a cheaper and less impressive laptop , then do not buy this computer .
The computer continued to give me issues and in Late June it completely died again and I tried to call Acer again to get it fixed and they refused to help me , they said my warrenty was up and hung up on me .
Well , I had completed the presentation in powerpoint the night before on my PC , but took the Apple to the conference .
I am very happy I bought this Mac , well worth the extra money .
She tells me about it all the time but I tend to shut off all cognitive functions when she gets that yapper going .
This is my second laptop , and it is head and shoulders above my first .
The salesman talked us into this computer away from another we were looking at and we have had nothing but problems with software problems and just not happy with it .
I like this machine because its very lightweight ...
Pretty much made sense to get a Mini .
Finally was able to reach a young lady in California and ordered the machine and was subsequently given a delivery date .
It works great for general internet use , Microsoft Office apps , home bookkeeping , etc .
With in weeks of purchasing my computer is began to slow down .
Very happy with my 7th Toshiba laptop !
This Macbook Pro is fast , powerful , and runs super quiet and cool .
The screen is nice and the images comes very clear , the keyboard and the fit just feels right .
It 's not like I have used for half a year and then complained about it .
They told me it was my loss even though it was the computer , not what I 've done .
Runs fast and the regular layout keyboard is so much better .
This computer literally takes about five minutes to start up and to be able to use without it crawling and I DO mean crawling .
- I propose that they can just swap the hard drives .
The magnetic plug-in power charging power cord is great ( I even put it to the test by accident ) - excellent innovation !
Maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden .
He 's thrilled with his new laptop .
Overall a nice computer .
I was waiting for this model to be released since January , and have been holding off on buying a Macbook Pro until the new model came out .
This was the second computer and brand bought that day .
Enabling the battery timer is useless .
The battery gets so HOT it is scary .
Temperatures on the outside were alright but i did not track in Core Processing Unit temperatures .
Needs a CD/DVD drive and a bigger power switch .
4gb of ram ...
It seems to have some opions that are intalled but do not work like I thought they would .
Those moments in thime where you want to throw something against the wall ? Yeah , I wanted to throw that lap top out the window and light it on fire .
So far , I have no complaints .
I made the right decision .
if this computer every breaks down on me i will most definatly get the same one again .
The Macbook starts fast , does n't crash , has a fantastic display , is small and light ( I have the 13.3 " model ) , and is n't always complaining about updates , lost connections , errors , blue screens , etc .
Highly recommended !
It easily fits into most computer bags but does n't weigh down a backpack or satchel when being carried with spirals and/or textbooks .
also it comes with very useful applications like iphoto that it is the best photo application i have ever had
Having heard from friends and family about how reliable a Mac product is , I never expected to have an application crash within the first month , but I did .
I never had this kind of quality issue with Dell ( not to say Dell is that great ) , not with a brand new laptop .
Put a cover on it and is a little better but that is my only complaint .
Like the price and operation .
Good computer and fast .
Fan vents to the side , so no cooling pad needed , great feature !
it might be something deep within Windows , for I was unable to create a disk image on my hard drive .
I am very happy with my first Mac .
iLife is easily compatible with Microsoft Office so you can send and receive files from a PC .
I like it !
BAck she goes !
Customization on mac is impossible .
I loved the netbook ( minus the fact that it was windows OS ) until this started happening .
I was originally concerned that I could n't view work I had done in college on my Mac because of the PC formatting , but I was even more thrilled to learn of programs like iLife and iWork that allow you to convert your PC documents into readable files on Macs .
Typing on the keyboard becomes uncomfortable after extended use due to the sharp edges that your wrists rest on .
Mine came at $ 1,700 w/o a DVD burner ( ! ) .
Just beware no DVD slot so when I went to install software I had on CD I could n't .
In my opinion it was not as user friendly as I expected either .
The laptop is very lightweight , can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight .
As for the laptop , this is our 3rd Apple computer in the past 2 years .
Handles all my basic media needs easily .
apple is one of the best computer companies in the country .
I first purchased this Dell model " 1764 " on April 6 , 201
I sent it back to Toshiba twice they covered it under the warranty .
I am sorry that I purchased this laptop .
Also , the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it .
As a user of a PC , I will will admit that the macBook Pro has a better running system in which I found myself " Getting the job done quicker .
- they lost my laptop for a month
It is truly a Desktop Replacement .
Also , HDD secures inside using rails , and there is only one set on the main hard drive .
I am using the external speaker - sound is good .
I currently own a Lenovo laptop as well as my new MacBook Pro , and each have their own strengths and weaknesses .
I am constantly trying to uninstall programs , clean cookies , and delete unused files .
I like to use it at the race track to handiecap the horse races .
A mac is very easy to use and it simply makes sense .
It does n't have a lot of frills , but I did n't need any , and being able to buy what I needed , and not more than I needed was very important .
If you have the money I suggest going for the i7 .
It was an all around waste of money for me .
Hope this helps !
This laptop is the most amazing little peice of machinery I have owned outside of the Iphone .
Boot-up slowed significantly after all Windows updates were installed .
Yes , he is a self professed " Mac snob .
No tutorials on the display .
Other installed features , such as certain printer software , are also most attractive .
Once you go Mac , you ca n't go back !
I have full control at all times of what is going on - there is no control + alt + delete business anymore .
Great pick for portability and affordability .
THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIFIC !!
I am not sure if it was the drive itself , however ;
This one has had the same effect .
- No backlit keyboard , but not an issue for me .
Keyboard is plastic and spongey feeling .
I was concerned that the downgrade to the regular hard drive would make it unacceptably slow but I need not have worried - this machine is the fastest I have ever owned ...
thanks for great service and shipping !
Apparently under the screen there are 2 little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth , they come loose .
, which Apple does n't offer , is why I bought my MacBook at Best Buy .
The best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once , it never slows down .
I thought the white Mac computers looked dirty too quicly where you use the mousepad and where you place your hands when typing .
OSX Mountain Lion soon to upgrade to Mavericks .
sounds like a typewriter , but if you can get past that , this is a great laptop for a little money !
I claim that this has no value to me , the laptop was new anyway .
Many people complain about the new OS , and it 's urgent for Apple to fix it asap !
The neat and organized icon list is a welcome change from cluttered and confusing desktop icons .
It is a big big , but since it has a 18.4 " screen what would you expect !
The graphics are stunning .
At $ 1899 to start , this is no cheap machine .
If you have to ask you do n't own a Mac and your just not in the know .
But then , something goes wrong .
upon giving them the serial number the first thing I was told , was that it was out of warranty and I could pay to have it repaired .
I work in film editing and post production , so I need a laptop that not only has power , but memory and speed as well .
Definitely worth spending the money on it .
User upgradeable RAM and HDD .
There are reviews that speak to a few possible glitches but , I have n't seen them yet .
I would recommend this computer to anyone searching for the perfect laptop , and the battery life is amazing .
- Called MacHouse Amsterdam to ask for a temporary replacement , no answer .
I should have checked this before I installed my applications .
You will fall in love with it in no time .
If you 're not wanting to be mobile , this is a good laptop to sit on a desk .
Purchased as a gift for a friend .
I told them that I just received my brand new MacBook but I was having issues .
This machine rocks !
We were PC users .
i had the bulk of problems with my lap top within the first six months .
It was secure and easy to navigate .
Dismantle the whole thing ? Then it will not be a newly manufactured set like before .
It 's slow and one day i hope to have the money to get rid of it and buy something else .
Amazing Quality !
He said quite a number of people had encountered this problem and said it is a common issue .
Finally set the unit back to HP after a month of hell .
Heck , I like all Mac computers , but they 're all WAY too pricey for the kind of economy the U.S. is going through .
In November my computer messed up entirely and would n't power on after intalling a Windows update , I had to have my HD flashed and lost EVERYTHING on it , including my school assignments and irriplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things , when this update was installed for some reason I was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installed it deleted my history .
This computer that I have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard functions .
So needless to day , I 'm not happy .
This is why I purchased a BRAND NEW LAPTOP in the first place so it would n't have ANY problems .
I do n't like this company nor the toshiba brand , and I 'll never buy another one because I 've put more into it then it is worth .
Windows XP SP2 caused many problems on the computer , so I had to remove it .
Now mainboard is broken , have to wait for a new one .
My favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga port so I can connect it to a bigger screen .
Great wifi too .
So far so good with this laptop .
For some odd reasons the computer does n't reconize the operation system .
I bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market .
, Applications respond immediately ( not like the tired MS applications ) .
They don t translate from a Mac , even on Word , resulting in a ton of run-on sentences .
Not sure how I recommend it for quality gaming , as I have a desktop rig for that reason .
The first one I had was a 2006 model , not the Pro .
When I finally had everything running with all my software installed I plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed .
You wo n't be disappointed .
I know what 7 hrs of battery looks like .
I am really heartbroken to have to post a terrible review .
Never had a single problem , and do n't have to worry about viruses .
its more like a snail crawl .
Unable to boot up this brand new laptop .
5 ) Cut my losses and sold it for parts
I use my friends and family 's $ 2000 laptops and they are fast and reliable and HP , well , I 'll never buy or recommend an HP to anyone !
The DVD burner broke after burning 3 DVD 'd during that time !
The Macbook is a fantastic laptop .
I have just had to learn to be a little harder typer than on my last computer .
But the performance of Mac Mini is a huge disappointment .
$ 999.00 Tax free .
I finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what I need it .
Unfortunately , that is not the case .
This is still a fairly good upgrade to a laptop that was about 4 years old .
They really do have the worlds very worst repair service .
might have to buy one for me now , since I use it all the time .
I can not even read what I am writing half of the time .
I loved it .
I have used PC 's and converting to this MacBook Pro was easy .
It lasted for many years of travel , kids and abuse and if I fired it up today , it would work .
What can I say .
However the frozen screens kept happening .
The computer was shipped to their repair depot on june 24 and returned on July 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned .
After talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate , I chose the MacBook Pro over the white MacBook .
It out performs any other laptop on the market today .
I am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook , it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop .
The " abuse " is that I pushed the power plug in too hard .
Beta had better quality , but VHS became the industry standard .
It 's perfect for everything and runs faster than an average pc !
There are so many wonderful features and benefits to the new MacBook !
Simply amazing computer !!
I grew up in a design family so it only made sense .
After using it for over a month , an issue started to surface .
of course my warranty runs out next month .
That seemed to solve the problem , till I wrote an article with semicolons in it .
Stupidly , mind-numbingly slow -- then I found it can only be loaded with 2GB * maximum * .
The switchable graphic card is pretty sweet when you want gaming on the laptop .
But if you 're willing to pay another 200 dollar for a windows disc .
I homeschool my kids and with this netbook next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat .
As of a couple weeks ago the middle portion of the laptop from top to bottom , , , about 4 inches across is hardly visible .
The internet speed is spectacular .
Strong build though which really adds to its durability .
There is NO way I will buy a LG product in the future .
It 's fast and has excellent battery life .
All-in-all , I would definitely recommend this product for nearly everyone .
Also , if you need to talk to a representive at Microsoft , there is a charge , which I believe is robbery , since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system , which most people would have went with XP if they could .
But I needed a laptop for school use .
* IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD LAPTOP , THIS IS NOT IT !
Even if Apple replaces whatever needs replacing I wonder if , since I seem to be doubling the amount of time I get out of it each time it 's " like new , " I might have 8 months next time .
If you had PC for four years I can almost gaurentee that something would of gone wrong by now , maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer .
Now I could get myself a cheap computer , that will probably work a whole lot better !
The i5 blows my desktop out of the water when it comes to rendering videos .
Everything about this computer is easy to use .
the latest version does not have a disc drive .
Do not purchase this laptop .
Again , the same problem , the right speaker did not work .
Quite simply this is the best laptop I have ever owned .
The brand of iTunes has just become ingrained in our lexicon now , but keep in mind that Apple started it all .
The battery life is probably an hour at best .
Very happy with my purchase .
Easy to customize setting and even create your own bookmarks .
I have been a mac user since the mid 90s .
These new problems were the final straws ;
This netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop ( my wife and I have another laptop ) , or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks .
The difference in the Apple keyboard from a PC 's keyboard took a bit of tim to get used to , but overall it 's worth it !
