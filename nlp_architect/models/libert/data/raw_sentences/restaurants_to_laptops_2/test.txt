Which is great I am running Vista Business and scored a 5.X on the index I have never seen a windows machine have a total score in the 5 's .
I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality !
It is better than my old acer laptop .
A great computer for light home use and business use .
It certainly does , but you rarely hear any of your friends with Mac 's complain about anything .
And if you are switching from a pc I hilghy sugest this one .
I finally own a piece of computing equipment that I do n't want to take a baseball bat and destroy .
I have used a couple of others on the job as well .
It 's just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open .
Screen is awesome , battery life is good .
Plus stylish .
A veryimportant feature is Firewire 800 which in my experience works better then USB3 ( in PC enabled with USB3 ) I was not originally sold on the MAC OS I felt it was inferior in many ways To Windows 7 .
I 'm pretty sure it 's not newegg 's fault but when you turn on a computer you just bought you want it to at least get to desktop .
So , I 'm cooled on Mac buys .
It 's a decent computer for the price and hopefully it will last a long time .
I 've installed to it additional SSD and 16Gb RAM .
A great feature is the spotlight search : one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword , rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document .
If you ask me , for this price it should be included .
WIth the upgraded memory , the MacBook Pro never has an issue running many many applications at once !
I run Dreamweaver , Final Cut Pro 7 , Photoshop , Safari , Firefox , MSN Messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time .
The lcd screen stopped working on mine after 10 months .
I called Toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem .
but after i got used to it i love it .
THIS is what a laptop is supposed to be .
while the keyboard itself is alright , the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the mouse command buttons .
Also , because of the size and consistancy of the laptop computer , some websites would n't even attempt to work on the computer because of browser problems .
Congratulations Asus for creating one big piece of dump which is my laptop .
I have Vista , so I am unable to install and uninstall some programs .
I 'm very happy with this machine !
Only other thing is that if you are using this for document creation Apple doesnt provide any kind of word processor ( such as works for windows ) , but iwork is cheap compared to office .
Good for every day computing and web browsing .
I should have kept my big , old HP .
What angers me more than anything else is that I spent all those years hating MACs when I could have been getting a lot more production with a whole lot less grief !
Returned laptop for repair a 2nd time and it came back with obvious physical damage ( keyboard bulging and speaker grill pressed in ) , buttons not working and USB ports inoperative .
The first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty .
I had to wait 3 weeks to get it back and it still is not working properly .
I like it so much , I bought another just for my wife .
The ATI graphics card is a huge plus , definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a Intel built-in card would have trouble with , such as Half-Life 2 or even World of Warcraft .
This purchase opened me to the world of Macbooks , and I am impressed with the intuition of the design , the beauty of the product , and the excellent technological advances associated with it .
Well i got this computer from Best Buy and I have had nothing but problems I bought the computer with a virus .....
Easy to carry , can be taken anywhere , can be hooked up to printers , headsets .
The aluminum body sure makes it stand out .
I definitely will buy a Mac again if and when this computer ever fails .
they had to replace the motherboard in April
The settings are not user-friendly either .
I used to build my own desktops from the component parts , and recently my 7 year old Pentium 4 with HT 1 GB ram SATA desktop stopped working ( this was a rock star 7 years ago ) .
I ca n't even install one of the 3 printers I have in my house so I am unable to print .
Not to mention , the battery life is absolutely amazing .
ASUS said my net-book was working properly .
After that I turned to email in my next vain help to get them to acknowledge that the warranty was still valid .
We used PC products - it seemed simpler to continue with the same thing .
I have had no luck with staples or HP to resolve this problem .
The performance is definitely superior to any computer I 've ever put my hands on .
PC users use the Powerpoint program for slide-show presentation and Mac users utilize Keynote .
Do n't waste your money or time .
This computer is really fast and I 'm shocked as to how easy it is to get used to ...
I 'm going back to DELL .
I LOVE IT !
The Windows 7 Starter is , in my opinion , a great way to think about using your netbook : basics , basics , basics .
Wonderful sleek case design is only on the outside .
Maybe not the cutting edge ( Satellite L455D ) but it is a workhorse .
Design : very durable .
Overall , I experienced a huge change in that my mac runs pretty fast compared to my old PC .
Of course , I inspected the other netbooks and clearly their hinges are tighter and I even demonstrate the difference between my netbook and others .
It is well worth the money it cost , Very good investment .
Theres always something wrong with it , wether it be some virus you ca n't track down , or it overheats , sometimes even catches on fire , you just ca n't use it .
12.44 seconds to boot .
Other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more .
It was just one problem after another for me , and that 's reason we had forked out so much money was so we would n't have anything to worry about .
Finally decided to try a MAC because there were too many choices of which PC 's to buy and EVERYONE who had a MAC said " buy a MAC " .
( but Office can be purchased ) IF I ever need a laptop again I am for sure purchasing another Toshiba !!
This is not Best Buy 's fault .
Its seen in movies , sitcoms , prominent important people carry and use them and they are GREAT !
I would never buy a Dell again .
EITHER THE COMPUTER IS TOO SLOW TO DETECT THE KEYS TYPED ( THIS IS UNLIKELY AS I AM A SLOW TYPIST ) OR THE KEYBOARD SIMPLY DOES NOT DETECT THE KEYS BEING TYPED .
I sent it back and found this time that the battery was faulty , so I got a new one and some other fixes they found .
I bought this last week , and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the touch-mouse stopped responding .
I 've saved a lot of time and headaches so far , using my new MacBook Pro .
I had the staff telling me older version did not make the fan noise cause it is a " different " computer .
It had most of the features and all of the power that I wanted to replace my desktop machine .
Just What I Needed For Portable And My Wallet Too !
After doing extensive research , macconnection had the lowest price on the 15 " MBP i5 .
Drivers updated ok but the BIOS update froze the system up and the computer shut down .
Fully charged , the MacBook Pro can last about five hours unplugged .
It is fast booting up , shutting down , and connection with the internet .
So glad I decided to upgrade !
Very disappointed !
This laptop rocks ( only wish it could run SolidWorks CAD - which Apple does n't support ) !
the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which I am used to it being on the side .
I can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly .
The laptop is relatively simple to use , though I bought Macs for Dummies , which is well worth $ 2
The gray color was a good choice .
I WILL NEVER AGAIN buy another Acer , not will I buy Gateway , or eMachine as they are all from the same company .
This is a review of windows vista system .
THIS LAPTOP WAS BAD FROM THE FIRST DAY OF USE ---- BROUGHT IT BACK TO STORE FOR RETURN OF MONEY .
I ' ts nice to have the higher-end laptops , but this fits my budget and the features I need .
I opted for the SquareTrade 3-Year Computer Accidental Protection Warranty ( $ 1500-2000 ) which also support " accidents " like drops and spills that are NOT covered by AppleCare .
It 's color is even cool .
My friends are in awe every time they come over !
It is really thick around the battery .
So , I paid a visit to LG notebook service center at Alexandra Road , hoping they can make the hinge tighter .
Hope this helped !
It super shiny , so you can see the fingerprints easily .
I do n't know why I did n't make the switch sooner ... o ya because it 's expensive .
I was taught to use Photoshop and was amazed .
She brought out 2 other identical netbooks and still insist that " It is like that one " .
I personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers .
I ca n't say enough good for it !
You just get a trial version either way .
Am very glad I bought it , great netbook , low price .
The battery was completely dead , in fact it had grown about a quarter inch thick lump on the underside .
But if you ca n't make your product last more than a year , you will not get my business again .
Vista is a nightmare .
wonderful features .
The iLife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product .
It 's more expensive but well worth it in the long run .
Both computers started acting extremely slow within the first year of owning them .
Summary : They played games with me for the warranty period .
It was n't worth it .
It will make life so much easier next semester , just wish I had it last semester !!
This hardware seems to be better than the iMac in that it is n't $ 1400 and smaller .
They sent out the box right away for me to send in my computer , they paid postage and whatnot , but when I got my computer back it still was n't running right , and now my CD drive was n't reading anything !
It was getting old and I needed a new school computer .
Amazing machine .
Well , I bought this laptop a month or two ago .
The love part of my relationship with this laptop does n't take very long .
NOW AM VERY APREHENSIVE ABOUT TOSHIBA LAPTOPS .
Also the display is exceptional !
also ... - excellent operating system - size and weight for optimal mobility - excellent durability of the battery - the functions provided by the trackpad is unmatched by any other brand -
The Toshiba laptop I am using is easier to use than most I have tried .
Although i do believe that Windows operating system may be to fault for some of the problems .
It is super fast , and always loads .
The speed difference is next to NOTHING for a mac , and the hard drive can be manually upgraded or you could just buy a $ 60 500gb external hard drive .
I was also able to install and use my Photoshop and AfterEffects programs easily .
So glad I have gone this route !!
Never been happier using computer .
Extremely disappointed with the way it is .
I love the way the entire suite of software works together .
This is no exception .
Without a doubt , the * design * of this laptop is fantastic .
From the start , when you open the box you see a completely different class of machine .
Then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me .
No viruses .
I am ADDICTED to photo booth !
I am not happy at all with the product I purchased .
Not only are the versions of these programs able to be saved , worked on and opened on both a PC and Mac , the versions of these programs on a Mac are graphically and functionally superior .
Wireless has not been a issue for me , like some others have meantioned .
This was my first MacBook purchase ever .
- Estimated time to fix it : 10 working days or less .
Other Thoughts : I love newegg , I recommend them to the world however this is just unacceptable .
I was given a demonstration of Windows 8 .
Yes , the MBP is more expensive than competing PC laptops .
I know some people complained about HDMI issues but they released a firmware patch to address that issue .
It was fast , and it was " different " .
the screen brightness automatically adjusts .
She said Wal Mart rants and raves abouy carring Dell because it 's a big name but they are a piece of garbage .
My Macbook was worth ( after 3 years of use ! ) $ 375 .
With what I paid for this computer it should have had everything on it .
The battery life also does n't keep up with the claim but still I think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack .
In desparation , I called their Customer Service number and was told that my warranty had expired ( 2 days old ) and that the priviledge of talking to a technician would cost me ( " have your credit card ready " ) .
The resolution is even higher then any other laptop on the market .
The ease of set up was terrific .
There is no need to purchase virus protection for Mac , which saves me a lot of time and money .
The machine has a bluray player the book has no mention of it or how to connect it to your HDTV .
A longer battery life would have been great - but it meets it 's spec quite easily .
Have purchased many products over the years from MacConnection and this transaction , like all the others , we smoothly with no problems .
This system is not worth the money or trouble trying to get it fix .
I did not take the class and wish that I would have .
I previously owned a Toshiba and it only lasted about 2 years .
Was not happy with one of the programs on it .
Everything about the Mac is not only visually appealing , but very easy to use .
Also , in using the built-in camera , my voice recording for my vlog sounds like the interplanetary transmissions in the " Star Wars " saga .
Dell sucks
The power plug has to be connected to the power adaptor to charge the battery but wo n't stay connected .
The board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues .
The only thing I dislike about this laptop are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the computer for grip .
Tried to make a recovey disk wouldnt get passed the first recovery disk .
on the bright side at least I was n't without my laptop for long this time !
Taking it anywhere was a pain !
I would definitely not go back to using a PC after using the mac .
seriously why have n't they just replaced it by now .
Besides , the apple stocks have been falling due to lack of sales .
As a lifelong Windows user , I was extremely pleased to make the change to Mac .
So , after Apple replaced the hard drive I enjoyed another 4 months of my new computer , until it froze this morning -- completely .
My house is now 100 % Macbook .
This computer is not cheap and represent an achievement for me .
And I may be the only one but I am really liking Windows 8 .
Also I typed faster then then letters would show and it got to be realy annoying .
It was super easy to set up and Is really easy to get used to .
Battery life could be better but overall for the price and Toshiba 's reputation for laptops it 's great !
Summary : Dont buy HP .
Almost 4 years ago I bought what was then the current , up to date HP Pavilion -- If I recall correctly , it was the dv 1300 t.
My Iphone synced right up just like a person would expect , unlike the PCs in our lives .
The guy then said that if I insist on having the hinge tightened , they can do it for me but I have to accept the condition after the " repair " .
I ca n't even remember how I finally got it taken care of , but I was done with Sony after that !
I have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing .
Dells are ok , HPs are n't that good , but Macs or Fantastic .
Ca n't close the 2nd HDD bay since there are brackets you have to break off ( even then , it still does n't shut ) That could be a major flaw for the dual HDD user .
I was told that it seems to be a multi - component failure .
Exactly as posted plus a great value .
It has a .1 ghz faster processor and a stock 500gb hard drive .
previous laptops were pc 's , still have them , but the mac osx is a clean and smooth operating system .
Enjoy your sitdown
The image is great , and the soud is excelent .
2 months later , the battery went .
The best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features .
Looked at HP , ASUS , Acer , Sony and a bunch of other ones but could not find I really liked .
The improvements to the OS have been relatively gradual , but substantive .
It is very easy to integrate bluetooth devices , and USB devices are recognized almost instantly .
The rep did not even answer my question , I had to ask him , if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he did n't even try to acknowledge my question .
I went right out and purchased another laptop .
So think about factoring those things in when you purchase .
So far , a great product .
I was really happy because it is a much better price on amazon.com than it was in the Mac store .
I 've tried going back to XL but there still problems .
All my devises “ talk ” to each other .
I have never had an experience like this .
Very satisfied .
The pricing is very competitive .
I had 3 months when the ports started going out .
Do I like the computer ? Well , other than not getting viruses , I guess it is OK .
I love the easy to see screen , and It works well for work , persoal or just play .
At home and the office it gets plugged into an external 24 " LCD screen , so built in screen size is not terribly important .
The keyboard is slick and quiet and not bulky like some other laptops I have had in the past .
I like the operating system .
I needed a laptop with big storage , a nice screen and fast so I can photoshop without any problem .
This has happened three times so far .
Now that I have it I see that I really needed this for much more .
In my house , HP is a nasty word .
Also , you wo n't have to worry about them going onlne a getting a virus .
Needs constant repair .
I just bought the new MacBook Pro , the 13 " model , and I ca n't believe Apple keeps making the same mistake with regard to USB ports .
I have the A65 - right now it 's a paperweight .
The acer one computer that I bought is 17 ince screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it , but I like the big screen on it .
falls into the case .
I paid about 18000 for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me .
One suggestion I do have , is to not bother getting Microsoft office for the mac expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a PC .
However I dealt with this problem for over a year and it was more of a hastle then I have EVER had with anything .
If internet connectivity is important I would recommend going with a dell net book for 50 bucks more , or buy a USB wireless card .
And Toshiba is totally unconcerned .
But I do NOT like Win8 .
It discharges too quickly .
This version of MacBook Pro runs on a third-generation CPU ( " Ivy Bridge " ) , not the latest fourth-generation Haswell CPU the 2013 version has .
The thunderbolt port is awesome !
We were occasional Mac users before , but most recently owned a budget PC since it is what we could afford .
I was psyched .
I had the same reasons as most PC users : the price , the overbearing restrictions of OSX and lack of support for games .
Some problems can be fixed if you purchase new software , but there is no guarentee .
First the screen goes completely out .
I received this laptop as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst .
The unibody design is edgy and durable .
That 's the downside for me .
she ca n't tell the difference between it and her regular desktop system .
Runs like a champ .....
A seventy dollar mouse !
The internet was locekd and froze every time it was trying to be used , and the command prompt would not work at all .
I can throw anything at it ( and I do ) , Pictures , video editing , schoolwork .
It 's absolutely wonderful and worth the price !
This is perfect for her field .
however , they were kind enough to send a replacement free of charge .
Two times with in one month .
* 4 weeks after giving the computer for repair * - Annoyed at MacHouse Amsterdam , decided to send complaint email to Apple .
I wiped nearly everything off of it , installed OpenOffice and Firefox , and I am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price .
The paint wears off easily due to the keyboard being farther back than usual .
The display is incredibly bright , much brighter than my PowerBook and very crisp .
This item is a beautiful piece , it works well , it is easy to carry and handle .
I especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems !
They did n't even try to assist me or even offer a replacement .
I would recommend not buying this product .
The screen gets smeary and dusty very quickly and it 's very noticeable .
Having a Mac certainly makes life easier .
Some days it 's just blurry , some days it appears that it 's raining on my nice desktop background of a lake and mountains .
Everything is so easy and intuitive to setup or configure .
I do transcription work on the side , and the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well .
I sit down and use my husband 's work PC and I do n't like it one bit .
I did have to replace the battery once , but that was only a couple months ago and it 's been working perfect ever since .
Its the best , its got the looks , super easy to use and love all you can do with the trackpad ! . .
Buying a Mac Mini would allow me to make the transition .
It is always reliable , never bugged and responds well .
IT IS TRASH !
This ai n't it .
I purchased it this year when my old HP laptop finally died and I was looking for something smaller and lighter than a laptop to carry around for classes and traveling .
Now when I order I did not go full scale for the webcam or full keyboard I wanted something for basics of being easy to carry when I use crutchs or wheelchair and with a backpack laptop bag .
lots of preloaded software .
It is the perfect size and speed for me .
Within a few hours I was using the gestures unconsciously .
It was so exciting for me to unwrapp my new mac .
I always use a backup hard disk to store important files at all times .
Meets my needs perfectly and is light enough for this senior to carry without affecting my arthritis .
However , there are MAJOR issues with the touchpad which render the device nearly useless .
But the quality , in general was less than the worth of the cheap laptop .
Apple removed the DVD drive Firewire port ( will work with adapter ) and put the SDXC slot in a silly position on the back .
It 's a bummer and one out of five is being kind .
also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard .
It doesnt get hot like my PC , with technology always at the tip of our fingertips anytime I forget how to do something i just google it .
Heck , if I had enough ' money , I would but it as a gift for someone .
5 months dead again .
Apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached .
:) Great product , great price , great delivery , and great service .
All the customers that come in hate Dell .
Pretty disappointed about this product .
Moving from a PC to Mac has never been easier , and I 'm glad that I did it .
I 'll stick to Tashiba .
Well I spilled something on it and they replaced it with this model , which gets hot and the battery does n't make it through 1 DVD .
It 's just what we were looking for and it works great .
I thought the price was great for the specs .
Awesome form factor , great battery life , wonderful UX .
Runs real quick .
The troubleshooting said it was the AC adaptor so we ordered a new one .
This is my first apple laptop .
The backlit keys are wonderful when you are working in the dark .
Finally , I purchased a Toshiba .
The battery lasts as advertised ( give or take 15-20 minutes ) , and the entire user experience is very elegant .
I 'm not going to lie , I 've never really liked the Acer brand in general .
It allows me to do everything I need from a computer and more .
The only thing I can imagine is that Sony jumped on early specifications for Vista requirements from Microsoft and designed it to those inadequate requirements .
I ca n't imagine EVER buying a PC again !
They need to stop outsoucing and send some complaint calls to US based customer service agents for those who live in the United states .
The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely .
After replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working ( 3 months of use ) which was frustrating .
He did n't work for sony , he was just approved to fix their crappy products .
Oh yeah , do n't forget the expensive shipping to and from HP .
Info : Windows failed to load because the kernal is missing , or corrupt .
I bought this laptop because of the performance to price ratio .
My wife recently purchased an Apple MacBook Pro and our granddaughter fell in love with it and asked for one for her birthday .
without a big ol' clunky machine in my backpack , I feel like I can do programming homework anywhere .
while about 8 years ago , I hope that the quality has changed .
It has come into good use for my finances , scheduling , my parents business expenses , and it is definitely amazing for gaming .
Oh , it is such a great piece of equipment .
The reaction of Toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter .
The MacBook Pro is very sturdy and versatile .
Remember to do your research first before consider buying a toshiba product .
Adjust the sensitivity since it 's not that responsive to begin with .
If you are a person like me , more on the creative side , the mac has something for you too .
I ve had several calls lasting more than an hour with promises to call back , but the return calls never came .
It is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed .
After fumbling around with the OS I started searching the internet for a fix and found a number of forums on fixing the issue .
Bought this gateway M-50 or 150 early 2007 .
PC never worked right even after BIOS fixed .
I considered I may have too much on the computer , but after looking , there was plenty of space and that is not the issue .
I finally decided on this one and could n't be any happier .
The Unibody construction is solid , sleek and beautiful .
If you 're looking for a great laptop , you 've found the best here .
tech support would not fix the problem unless I bought your plan for $ 150 plus .
This laptop has left me with a HORRIBLE taste in my mouth for Acer brand products .
Money and time well spent !
I had a USB connect but , i ca n't use it because it is not compatible .
It is very user friendly and not hard to figure out at all .
I was a little weary at purchasing another 13 " macbook almost 2 years later but t looks like the newer macbooks have gotten its current line of graphics cards in order this time around .
It was a bad experience but i played down its importance .
Sells for the same as a netbook without sacrificing size .
It 's fast , light , and is perfect for media editing , which is mostly why I bought it in the first place .
I have not have any problems .
Lord HAVE MERCY !
It was a laugh too !
I would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express .
The battery life is great .
I 'm pleased .
The difference is the Toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space .
Out of the box I noticed how small it was and was exactly what I was looking for .
It was very easy to just pick up and use -- It did not take long to get used to the Mac OS .
It is a cheap throw together .
The quality , engineering design and warranty are superior -- covers damage from dropping the laptop .
All you have to do is turn it on and it works .
It suddenly can not work .
Instead it is sitting in West Verginia waiting for UPS to take two days to send Me a box and Two days for them to ship the computer some 691 miles by air ? to Louisville Ky .
For the price and what I get out of it has exceeded my expectations .
It was about six months later when the overheating problem started again , to the point it felt like fire on the bottom of the machine !
You will love this macbook if you choose to buy it .
It is a much more streamlined system for adding programs , using the internet , and doing other things everyone does on a computer .
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse .
Ever since I bought this laptop , so far I 've experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer services I received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines .
It is sleek , smooth , and lightweight .
I think the manual is somewhere on the hard drive , but I rather have a hard copy .
This is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design .
Does exactly what I bought it 4 .
it has all the features that we expected and the price was good , working well so far .
See when it comes to laptops you buy it and get just a normal operating system with trials of must need stuff that should come with it .
i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus .
Was searching online for a power supply when I found this site .
Take your time and go through the tutorials patiently .
The computer is currently in West Verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by Toshiba .
We upgraded the memory to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace increase in speed .
I own other Macs but always find myself navigation to the MacBook Pro to get my work done .
I love it !
When the buyer returned it Wal Mart just boxed it , taped it shut resold it as new .
This is a great value for the money .
No Cd Rom in the new version there 's no way I 'm spending that kind of money on something has less features than the older version .
Replaced this one with my mac that was stolen , its a great computer .
To be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk .
This computer does everything i need it to do for school and more .
The store honored their warrenty and made the comment that they do n't even recommend the HP brand because of the problems with their warrentys .
I hate to say this , but if I could take this back to the shop and get my money back , then I would .
No , tey do n't even support their own bios and it " could be a problem with the bios " How can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity ??!!
The only thing I wish is the 15 inch MacBook Pro has much better speakers on the side of the keyboard .
If you 're looking for something to fly through those massive spreadsheets or play a graphics-intensive game , you 'd be better off getting a machine aimed at that segment of the market .
But , at the same time they ( the company ) would not and could not do anything about my problem .
It 's priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box .
I love how easy every thing is to do on my Apple products .
On 3 July 2004 , I purcased this model at Best Buy for about $ 150
I have no idea how to burn cd 's or to use the web cam , just for starters .
But I was completely wrong , this computer is UNBELIEVABLE amazing and easy to use .
Have one myself and Love it !
tried windows 8 and hated it !!!
The item received was exactly as identified .
And it is impossible to get them back in .
I had static in the output , and I had to reduce the sound output quality to " FM " as opposed to the default " CD .
After paying over $ 1000 for this computer , it was not worth it .
I got what I paid for .
With all the programs that came with it , such as iLife and iWork , I was set from the very beginning .
Garageband is easy to work with , like all the other apple applications I 've had experience with .
I am just ONE of the million customers .
I got the new adapter and there was no change .
I always have used a tower home PC and jumped to the laptop and have been very satisfied with its performance .
It gives me the power and speed that I need to run all the programs I use to edit .
It 's a good fix , in my opinion .
got another 1 , and same issue .
the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have .
Either way I 'm furious .
There was a little difficulty doing the migration as the firewire cable system ca n't be used with the iBook .
They 're easy , fun , powerful and will last a long time .
) And printing from either word processor is an adventure .
The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely .
What a great little laptop .
Although I was promised about 10 hours , I found myself to a limited 7 hours ( which is still amazing ) .
I am just amazed .
No HDMI port .
They sent out a Sony ' Certified ' technician .
Theres a built in camera with special effects - for video and photography .
The apple care has never failed me , and I expect it to be the same for this computer as well .
This can be annoying at first but you just have to train yourself not to to start over so far .
But when I received my replacement , I made BOTH recovery DVDs ( 4 ) , and a driver/application DVD .
I would Highly recommend this MacBook .
it has times were it freezes for 10 seconds and then starts again .
The battery life is amazingly long at 7hrs and 5hrs if you use it .
Its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer .
Comes with iMovie ;
I just bought this laptop 3 days ago .
Has met or exceeded my needs for a compact travel device .
The port is secured to motherboard so when this happens you ca n't see the plug at all , it 's just gone .
Now I had not tried to use this since the disc drive had been replaced and after taking it back to the Geek Squad I found out they had accidently not used the right drive when they replaced the first one , so back it went to get the correct drive .
Screen is a bit glossy , but that 's not too bad .
My first problem was with the pre-loaded Norton Firewall/Security program .
Then 2 of my nephews were going into music and both fell in love with the MacBook Pro .
This is a great laptop and I would recommend it to anyone .
Thank you .
I had a MacBook Notebook , and it had absolutely no protection from viruses , spyware , malware , etc .
The games included are very good games .
It still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there .
I could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat .
I am currently out of town and called to inform them the broken part would be returned when I got back in town .
So , you can imagine how unhappy I am with this item .
Being a PC user my whole life ....
When I took it back to Best Buy I asked them if they were seriously trying to drive me insane !
The Genius at the Apple store advised me that there was nothing about my use of the computer that caused this failure .
Unfortunately , Apple 's quality has continued to slide .
can never go wrong with apple products .
Amazing product as you would expect from Apple .
People know what they are talking about and they have pride in the product that they are selling .
They really screwed the pooch on this one .
Then the hard drive failed ;
It is the best all around Mac .
It has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp .
The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months , stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes .
I pondered very long over this decision .
I ordered through MacMall , which saved me the sales tax I would have incurred buying locally .
Downfalls : sharp edges .
It was important that it was powerful enough to do all of the tasks he needed on the internet , word processing , graphic design and gaming .
But guess what ? ( you have to buy an external dvd drive it does n't have a built in type ) The notebook ca n't be used because it does n't read anything for an external drive .
Small screen somewhat limiting but great for travel .
I was considering buying the Air , but in reality , this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient , even though it 's about .20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier .
I wanted a simple , reliable laptop .
I bought this laptop and found its TAB is not functioning .
The apple macbook pro nothing to say butprofessionally great and outstanding .
The only time I have restarted is during system updates .
I was looking for a mac which is portable and has all the features that I was looking for .
great price free shipping what else can i ask for !!
It did fairly well , other than it 's poor performance , overheating and occational blue screen .
return it .
Let me tell you , this machine is great .
and it fits in my briefcase with ease
There is no HDMI receptacle , nor is there an SD card slot located anywhere on the device .
The computer was two weeks late in delivery because HP forgot to complete the required import paperwork .
It is so speedy .
It 's not a wear-and-tear issue , not due to user carelessness and most importantly , they CA N'T guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and I have to accept the outcome .
Did I mention everything about it , from size to weight to keyboard screams BULK ?
the two of us use it regularly .
I made a perfect decision when I bought the Toshiba !
The audio volume is quite low and virtually unusable in a room with any background activity .
I have had a black macbook since 2007 .
Was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba ? Probably not ever again .
I had finally reached my limit and broke down .
Although the price is higher then Dell laptops , the Macbooks are worth the dough .
I have recently converted back to a mac and I could n't be happier !
Thinking about returning it
so we got a good deal on hsn for an ascer notebook and we bought it for him .
It has everything I would need for a home computer .
This computer is exceptionally thin for it 's screen size and processing power .
Yet my mac continues to function properly .
The sound as mentioned earlier is n't the best , but it can be solved with headphones .
Should be there by the end of the week ( again ... ) .
it has 3 usb ports , 1 sd memory card reader and an sd memory car expansion .
IT WANT TAKE IT , IT KEEP SAYING ERROR .
I have only had PCs with Windows before so this takes a little getting use to .
It runs very quiet too which is a plus .
I 'm now trying to decide on another Dell model .
Granted , it 's still a very new laptop but in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops , my Mac boots up noticeably quicker .
It 's shiny and it 's pretty .
Then I 've fixed the DC jack ( inside the unit ) , rewired the DC jack to the OUTside of the laptop , replaced the power brick .
Simple to use , and great graphics .
I 've had this laptop for about a month now .
NO STAR FOR THIS TRASH . [ ...
So , buyers beware !
i needed one to be able to carry to work everyday and this one seems to fit all of the criteria .
The one thing that Apple does right is computers .
When I got my laptop back after this first instance it worked okay for a little bit then I started expeirencing issues again , everything from programs and drivers failing again , to it powering off for no reason , to locking up and freezing and just all sorts of issues .
I spent 2200 dollars on a " top of the line laptop " .
Great things come in small " packages .
( You may be reading one now !
they will not let you down .
What a mistake !
My laptop worked again for just a while before I started having issues AGAIN .
Couldnt not use it .
Laptop is advertised as a 15 " but the casing looks like that of a 17 " .
You can imagine that an expensive item as a laptop will not be left on your front steps , it needs signature to pove that you received it .
The speed is incredible and I am more than satisfied .
I am an Info Sys major in college , so I started researching this issue on my own .
With a MAC computer I have more free time as I do n't have to wait for windows to boot up or shut down and all the viruses associated with windows .
10 plus hours of battery ...
This was the same problem with my MacBook ( circa 2007 ) that I just retired .
Somehow the system clock got messed up after reboot .
I would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front .
Good in every aspect .
Enjoy that Toshib force and durability unparalleled
I upgraded the memory and replaced the base Windows 7 Starter to Win 7 Home , and it runs just fine .
Overall this laptop is great .
I have now had it for 1.5 months and love it .
No big deal .
TOSHIBA WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THIS PROBLEM .
Searched it on amazon and on bestbuy .
I work as a designer and coder and I needed a new buddy to work with , not gaming .
They do n't just look good ; they deliver excellent performance .
Obviously , this Macbook is P-E-R-F-E-C-T for me because it does exactly what I need in an easy-to-function way .
It is the worst laptop ever
All the programs are easy and straight forward on my MacBook Pro , it is clean and organized , which I always strive to be myself .
I bought my first MacBook after seeing the product demonstrated .
This is now my 3rd MacBook Pro and I really honestly love it !
They only stay charged a little over an hour .
Laptops are usually used on the go , so why not give you a better battery ?
The screen graphics and clarity , and sharpness are great .
I initially purchased my Macbook Pro 13 " in April , and I loved it .
I 'm just really happy that I waited to buy , because this thing kicks a $ $ !
It 's the inside that is truly wonderful .
The pro is a great product , I wish that the 13 inch models came with the Intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge ( the edges hurt my wrists ) .
You may soon mistake my digitus medius as a lively pogo stick .
Every day I had this computer , something failed on it .
But not in this case .
I go to purchase it on line , and I find out that the device will not be available until almost two months later !
For the not so good , I got the stock screen - which is VERY glossy .
I am able to organize my pics , music and files easily .
A coupla months later , they change my hard drive .
My real problem with it ? The statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it 's a lie .
It could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have DDR5 instead of DDR3 .
- When I started worrying for not hearing anything from them , I tried to call .
I love its solid build , light wt and excellent battery life ( for now ) .
Very nice unibody construction .
The new MBP offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months .
I have had it over a year now with out a Glitch of any kind . . I love the lit up keys and screen display ... this thing is Fast and clear as can be .
Boot time is super fast , around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute .
I started hainv problems with it within the first month .
and its not hard to accidentally bang it against something so i recommend getting a case to protect it .
I got this laptop on Black Friday .
Far superior to my MacBook .
Plus it is small and reasonably light so I can take it with me to and from work .
Note , however , that any existing MagSafe accessories you have will not work with the MagSafe 2 connection .
It 's great to have a solid Mac in the living room .
The macbook rarely requires a hard reboot .
I find myself using the 10-key more than I thought I would .
They sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that I return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later .
The trackpad was easy to learn and navigate .
Now for the hardware problems .
pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were .
You will not regret buying this computer !
I continued to take the computer in AGAIN and they replaced the hard drive and mother board yet again .
The black model also has a very nice seamless appearance - one of the better looking notebooks I 've seen .
This time the mouse pad and right click key would n't work !
Before I begin , I will say that I am not like a good percentage of the people that will end up writing a review on this computer - I am not an Apple fanboy .
Not super light but still a good one .
By Air sounds more like by truck to Me .
I would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of grabage .
I really wanted a Mac over a pc because I used a Mac in high school .
The 4 USB ports are nice , but the two on the side only work now and then .
My laptop is so light that I can take it with me anywhere .
It looks and feels solid , with a flawless finish .
It works really well .
The SuperDrive is quiet .
I was n't really sure I wanted to spend that kind of money !
I reinstalled windows through the recovery discs and everything seemed good again .
One more tip , please purchase this model and get a 4GB stick of RAM to save you $ 10
Summary : Spend your money elsewhere
i use my mac all the time , i love the software , the way it takes a short time to load things , how easy it is to use and most of all how you do n't have to worry about viruses .
Another thing I might add is the battery life is excellent .
Probably as good as you can get in a netbook , does everything I ask for and has some very good unexpected pluses .
Its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable .
I honestly love my mac , thats why I am a self proclaimed mac addict .
Only 2 usb ports ... seems kind of ... limited .
It has plenty of memory , lots of hard drive , and great graphics .
Small and light weight .
Anyone who is considering buying an Acer computer of any sort , I seriously suggest you look into buying a different brand .
great machine if you want to drop the cash for one .
And it did n't show up on the reciept , I do n't know how we ordered it online !
first i have been searching for long time before i decided to get mac .
AND the best part is that it even comes with a free printer ( when they have a certain promotion/offer going , of course ) !
If you are looking for something reliable , this is the laptop for you .
The design is awesome , quality is unprecedented .
I am very happy with this laptop .
I was always against them but now I buying one I 'll never go back to PC .
Still under warrenty so called Toshiba , no help at all .
I would recommend Mac , and do , to anyone looking to buy a new computer .
Additionally , there is barely a ventilation system in the computer , and even the simple activity of watching videos let alone playing steam games causes the laptop to get very very hot , and in fact impossible to keep on lap .
and plenty of storage with 250 gb ( though I will upgrade this and the ram . . )
Very fast and efficient !
This is another reason to like the Mac .
They claim call center is still down .
It has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer .
I had the computer for a full year and it was a new computer .
The Mac version of Microsoft Office is cheaper than buying the actual and works just as well .
returned it to walmart .
I 'm going to try and keep my old G4 on the road for as long as possible .
And if you have a iphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to it at high speed .
So what am I supposed to do ? The LG service center can not provide me the " service " when it is called the " service center " .
The body is a bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up .
its by far faster and more stable then my PC .
I babyed the heck out of it and i still do .
Do your research on this issue .
And the fact that Apple is driving the 13 " RMBP with the Intel4000 graphic chip seems underpowered ( to me .
It has served my needs quite nicely for the most part .
They click .
Summary : I 've had this laptop for 2 months , out of the blue the power adapter stops working .
Ideal for someone on the go or for a high school students .
After the bad experience with this computer went back to compaq .
Thank goodness for OpenOffice !
I enjoy very much my new Toshiba , purchased specifially for attending online schooling .
I purchased my first Mac and am glad I did .
Hopefully my replacement is brand new .
I got a mac as my HS graduation gift .
I wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month .
This Mac Mini makes the Macbook Pro seem slow .
Strengths : Well-shaped Weaknesses : A bad videocard !
I do n't use my laptop in a way though that needs a long battery life so it 's perfect for me .
I will definitely be getting a new laptop if it has any more issues after the warranty expires and researching carefully when I do so I do n't run accross a situation like this again !
This device has met my expectations and I 'm sure it will meet yours .
My wireless system would not recognize Windows 7 and I could n't get online to find out why .
Not worth it one bit .
It started out getting hot after only a few months .
The software is amazing .
I bought this Macbook Pro from Best Buy under a year ago to replace my old Macbook Air .
I did contact HP and share how unhappy I am .
I just took the broken cords into the Apple store and they gave me new ones .
I use the computer to basically check emails , surf the web , print coupons and for my college papers .
Most of my papers could not be saved and when they could be , half the time , the papers were then erased .
It 's applications are terrific , including the replacements for Microsoft office .
His was worth $ 36 .
The notebook would not turn back on again .
Very dissappointed becase I have had toshibas for years , and never a issue .
After way too many times sending the thing in for repairs ( delivery service was slow , and without the laptop I had no access to the internet , and thus no way of tracking it to find out when I might hope to see my computer again ) , it finally kicked the bucket after just over 2 years .
The sheer power and flexibility makes the MacBook Pro a must have for any techie !
However , the machine itself left a bit to be desired .
I spent alot of money on this product and its been a nightmare .
I had a little problem adjusting to the small screen but works fine as long as I remember to carry my glasses .
The screen shows great colors .
It still serves me well both in business and home needs .
Their products , including the MBP , are beautiful , sleek and clever .
There is no " tools " menu .
In those three years , I 've had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by Apple quickly and easily .
I got it back again and was told the motherboard had been replaced , so I was now on the SECOND motherboard within 3 months .
I was a little worry at first because I do n't have a lot of experience with os.x and windows has always been second nature to me after many years of using windows .
I came from the Dell Laptops and now I am so glad I switched when I needed a new laptop .
An absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will .
I recommend for word processing and internet users .
I 'll rather be out of date then spend more money on toshiba .
They ended up keeping my computer for almost 3 months !
another problem .
I bought a protector for my key pad and it works great : )
Just for a stupid CD .
I bought for my son in the 2nd grade .
This is the third MacBook Pro in our family .
However , it did not have any scratches , ZERO battery cycle count ( pretty surprised ) , and all the hardware seemed to be working perfectly .
I guess he was the technical person .
and it has blue screen crashed on me twice .
So , I took it back to the apple store and they narcissist genius bar staff ) fixed it by resetting the fan at boot up .
They are by far the easiest systems to actually learn about computers with .
The repairs were made quickly though I must say , however the second time they shipped it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me .
Hard disk - The new editions gives you more hard disk space ( 500GB instead of 320GB ) but time has taught me never to trust an internal hard disk .
bought notebook 07/2009 .
It has a faster processor and more ram .
i tried turning it done but it did nothing .
I 'm going back to PC .
The keyboard feels good and I type just fine on it .
I tried several monitors and several HDMI cables and this was the case each time .
Long story , but after many calls to various offices , I was told that no one can override the depot and that managers do n't take phone calls or e/mails .
The netbook is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me .
One drawback I noticed was sound quality via USB .
True quality at a great price !
The downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook : screen size is not something I 'd stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week .
To those thinking about switching , do it and do not look back !
There is hardly any memory on the computer 's hard drive .
I wanted a computer that was quite , fast , and that had overall great performance .
I love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention PC 's require .
It could n't have been a better decision .
They told me to reprogram the computer , and I did n't need to do that , and I lost pictures of my oldests first 2 years of her life .
A month or so ago , the freaking motherboard just died .
Very Very Highly Recommended .
I was so excited when my dad said i could get a new laptop for my birthday .
EVENTUALLY we pushed hard enough to convince them that this was the MACHINE that was causing the problems .
When it broke I wanted another Acer and chose the V5 .
By week two , my laptop had overheated and was completely dead even though I did not use it too much .
On start up it asks endless questions just so itune can sell you more of their products .
What I 'd like is for the laptop to run well without having to purchase additional memory .
This a starter notebook .
If you want a little more custom ability , drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of Win 7 and grab a 2GB stick of memory to spice it all up a bit more .
- Computer crashed frequently and battery life decreased very quickly .
Great overall .
Again , decent comp for the price , and I was in need of one quickly as my other laptop died on me .
I have had some excellent computer and have found I had no idea what to do with them
I have had many , many issues with PC 's in the past and I 'm finally glad to have joined the Mac revolution !
Within 3 weeks the same issues started happening AGAIN .
I have been very pleased with the performance of this laptop .
Runs Hot I thought we were paying for quality in our decision to buy an Apple product .
I did an internet search and this is a very common problem with this laptop .
But to be honest , I do n't use my computer for anything like graphics editing and complex data analysis and gaming .
It Was a great deal after all .
I recommend the Macbook Pro if you want the best laptop on the market .
So , I went back .
After 2 months of complaints , Asus finally sent the right power supply to my techies .
It would take up too much time to do reaearch for my papers and I would be up hours-just because the computer was too slow .
It is , however , very heavy .
His language was so bad I swore I was taking the turing test , and it was failing .
No hassle and no complaints .
That being said after 2 weeks of owning every time I start it up now it gives me a black screen for 5-8 seconds stating pxe-e61 media test error check cable .
You know , using the computer should be fun , not aggrevation , especially when you are playing games or working with photos .
After a little more than a year of owning my MacBook Pro , the monitor has completely died .
1 . You can not change your desktop background ( window 's 7 starter does NOT support that function ) .
I would n't play a first-person shooter with this , mind , but if you wanted to run MS Office , email , chat , download a video , listen to music from a certain fruit-named music store , and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in , I 'd highly recommend checking this out .
Which is what I did , check out my ACER 5517 !
I 'm glad I made the choice to switch and buy this MAC .
The local computer repair shops send out ads that say along the lines of we can fix almost any problem or computer usually even the trouble some Toshiba satellite .
I really do n't like it , but I am stuck .
Set up was easy .
But I do n't see it as a problem .
i love the keyboard and the screen .
I use it mostly for content creation ( Audio , video , photo editing ) and its reliable .
Minis make sense for a lot of people .
HP did n't fix it .
I have n't used the product long enough to write a detailed technical review .
Keyboard is great , very quiet for all the typing that I do .
I was also informed that the components of the Mac Book were dirty .
The company sent me a whole new cord overnight and apologized .
It has enough memory and speed to run my business with all the flexibility that comes with a laptop .
That is my only complaint !
Peformance is good for the price .
I waited to review to make sure it is what it is .
The capabilities using that program alone made me want a Mac .
The old unibody macbook pro could fry an egg after a while .
I had upgraded my old MacBook to Lion , so I kind of knew what I was getting , but had n't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features .
the internet can be an scary place its up to you on what you do with it .
Thank you for your great product !
When you look at the specs on Apple products in comparison to a Dell or a HP , yes they do seem to offer less for a higher cost .
- Managed to send complaint email .
The first time it crashed was maybe going on a year and a half of having it .
At first it worked well for a month or so then the system board failed and I send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later I then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now I have to send it back again to get it fixed again .
I went to my local Best Buy looking for a new laptop since mine broke .
It was truly a great computer costing less than one thousand bucks before tax .
I do n't really have a complaint .
now he mows yards so he can earn the money for the wireless internet .
believe me apple has a reputation .
I was going to buy today and noticed it went back up to $ 344.99 ?
I have a laptop as my regular computer , but found that disconnecting it and lugging it around was a drag .
It came in brand new and works perfectly .
I had to buy a wireless mouse to go with it , as I am old school and hate the pad , but knew that before I bought it , now it works great , need to get adjusted to the key board , as I am used to a bigger one and pounding .
3D rendering slows it down considerably .
The OS is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly .
returned it .
They are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site .
Charger seems large for this class of computer .
I am very Happy !
Delivery was early too .
The flaws are , this computer is not for computer gamers because of the OS X.
I like how the Mac OS is so simple and easy to use .
The people there just changed for me on the spot and I got a new arm piece and they did n't even request for a receipt .
So I 'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority .
but it has a major design flaw .
I was happy with My purchase of a Toshiba Satellite L305D-S5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the Toshiba Warranty .
It also does not have bluetooth .
I also purchased Office Max 's " Max Assurance " with the " no lemon " clause .
I chose the iBookG4 , a laptop that is an attractive computer with a large screen big enough to please anyone .
I highly recommend this laptop to anybody that wants great performance from a laptop and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your laptop out the door .
But let me tell you , the mac book pro is so professional .
And i would recommend this to anypne looking for a new laptop .
i will be returning it and switching brands when i get to best buy .
COMPUTER HAS BEEN AT SERVICE FACILITY MORE THAN IN MY HANDS .
i give this laptop a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me .
I like those programs better than Office and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the Office programs as well .
At least those computers did n't just die on me like this one .
Very good quality and well made .
and it comes with the new OSX that comes with new features that makes the use more easy .
Eventually the screen went blank and the computer would not turn on .
Could not keep up with me and finally the hard drive went out .
It had some kind of pre installed software update that completely shut the computer down when you clicked it .
I 'M REALLY FRUSTRATED BY THIS EXPERIENCE .
Waiting for the i7 was well worth it , great value for the price .
My MacBook is probably the best investment I have ever made .
3 weeks went by and the computer keeps crashing and will not open any applications .
I 'm the pro-active type so I went off and did some preventative fixes .
Call tech support , standard email the form and fax it back in to us .
Otherwise , I love it !
Hieroglyphics are quite common .
The screen , the software and the smoothness of the operating system .
:) In the past four years I 've had it I have never once gotten a virus .
Small enough to use on a long flight , Light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips .
I found it toughest to decide between Dell ultra books and Apple .
I love the feel of the key board , as well as the trackpad .
I would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express .
Apple is living up to its name with the mini and , for our needs , it 's perfect .
I think that if it is the motherboard again so soon that they should replace it .
Since I have always used Apple products , the choice of Macbook Pro was obvious .
Learning all of the keyboard shortcuts only took a few minutes to get used to as some of the shortcuts are the same on Windows machines .
Overall for the money this is a good deal .
2nd Mac book I have purchased from MacConnection .
The service I received from Toshiba went above and beyond the call of duty .
I had of course bought a 3 year warranty , so I sent it in to be replaced and ( almost 2 months later ) the dv4 is what the sent me as a replacement .
One drawback , I wish the keys were backlit .
I like the design and ease of use with the keyboard , plenty of ports .
apple has a reputation and is well known for its easy usage .
Took me 11 hours , 3 trips to different FedEx offices , and brutal conversations with 14 of the worse IT support technicians in the world .
The difference is it 's a whole lot of fun using the laptop now , still learning the Apple navigation , but is fun and comes with a lot of cool apps .
I would suggest this product to anyone .
And as for all the fancy finger swipes -- I just gave up and attached a mouse .
Clear picture on it and everything .
The other lock-up problems are from a myriad of causes , the most common being a corrupted version of Appleworks which can render the browser useless .
I 've had friends with Acers who seem to have had similar or exact same problems .
However , you have to adjust yourself to what it will do , not what you want it to do .
I am very satisfied with the mini .
I previously owned an HP desktop and a Dell laptop .
also it is light weight compared to others .
I 've never had problems with viruses .
Prior to this computer , I owned a PowerBook G4 for 6 years ( quite a long time for a laptop ) .
Disappointing for such a lovely screen and at a reasonable price
Its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action .
VERY disappointing :
What 's also interesting is this survey changed my ratings the first time I submitted it in case it does n't keep what I put here are my aratings
Dell 's customer disservice is an insult to it 's customers who pay good money for shoddy products .
I called Toshiba where I gave them the serial number and they informed me that they were having issues with the mother boards .
I ca n't begin to say how disappointed I am .
I just love this lap top , I just wish it were all silver or they had all black .
I will never complain about the price since I believe you get what you pay for and my MacBook Pro was worth every dollar .
Would like more trendy , high tech features .
I can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner .
i can use it for all of my needs .
Frustrated I hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time .
The only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets , and rather quickly too .
The battery life has not decreased since I bought it , so i 'm thrilled with that .
the only problem is that i had to add 1 gb RAM , the computer was kinda slow .
Not too expense and has enough storage for most users and many ports .
This flaw unfortunately detracts from everything else Apple got right with the Mini .
PLEASE MAKE THESE !
It 's now all commodity hardware .
I have three words : Piece of Junk !
I have had several machines over the years , both for personal and business use .
I purchased this netbook after my original Toshiba laptop crashed right after the warranty expired .
Quietest laptop I have ever owned .
- I give up on my data , I just want a computer reasonably fast ...
It 's been a couple weeks since the purchase and I 'm struggle with finding the correct keys ( but that was expected ) .
I ca n't honestly say I was heartbroken .
But the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing .
The laptop is gorgeous .
The OS is also very user friendly , even for those that switch from a PC , with a little practice you can take full advantage of this OS !
:] It arrived so fast and customer service was great .
First off , I really do like my MBP ... once used to the OS it is pretty easy to get around , and the overall build is great ... eg the keyboard is one of the best to type on .
This is the first Apple product that I have purchased .
DEFINITELY recommended !!!
Also , I have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly .
It would n't fit in most 17-inch bags .
I had left my regular laptop at home and needed something to use while out of town .
not the day received .
My last computer , a Toshiba , cost only $ 400 , and worked like a charm for many years .
Worth the investment and truly a fine piece of equipment .
Also , one of the users mentioned how the edges on the macbook is sharp , if you have money to spend on one of the incase shells , it does n't seem to be a problem .
Returned laptop for a 3rd repair and it came back with previous problems fixed ( except for speaker grill ) but the unit started locking up during use and eventually would not operate at all .
Then HP sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up , not able to connect .
I saved for this laptop for 3 months and I can tell you personally it was worth the wait .
My daughter uses it for games , email , facebook , pictures and music .
Apple is aware of this issue and this is either old stock or a defective design involving the intel 4000 graphics chipset .
I HATE this one .
Also , my sister got the exact same laptop ( since they were so cheap ) and after 8 months , the screen split in half just from everyday use .
Getting the Apple Care plan is a must .
Files as well would become lost , deleted or corrupted .
There are differences that you need to know and take time to learn .
That was my first Apple product and since then I have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs I have bought .
It 's so nice to look at and the keys are easy to type with .
There are a few flaws as well that I noticed .
I have n't used it for anything high tech yet , but I love it already .
My next laptop will also be a Mac !
But reasons we chose this Apple computer .
My friends or children use that when they need to borrow the Net =) When I out grow this Meaning when its old and my oldest child is ready for one she will get this one ANd I will be buying only TOSHIBA !
It has a 10 hour battery life when you 're doing web browsing and word editing , making it perfect for the classroom or office , and in terms of gaming and movie playing it 'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours .
Speakers do n't get that loud , but good enough .
Great laptop for school , easy to use for beginners in the household .
It is everything I 'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint , but somehow a bit more sturdy .
We researched and found the best price at MacConnection .
This Notebook restarts every time there is a new update , so if you do n't save your files and information , everything will be lost .
The only downfall is the battery only last 1.5-2 .0 hrs when not plugged in .
Support has been lackluster and now I just want a refund .
Skype is just so dang cool with this machine too .
little short on RAM but you get what you pay for .
The battery life is excellent - 6-7 hours without charging .
It 's annoying very much and I wo n't ever buy any Acer products .
i cant believe HP put this out .
Lightweight and the screen is beautiful !
I feel that it was poorly put together , because once in a while different plastic pieces would come off of it .
Its everything mac offers .
Additional caveat : the base installation comes with some Toshiba-specific software that may or may not be to a user 's liking .
The lesson learned here is : It does not pay to by this loyal to any brand , since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible , as fast as they can , and in this day and age , the customer no longer is right all the times .
Suffice it to say , my MacBook Pro keeps me going with its long battery life and blazing speed .
packing and everything was perfect
I love the 15 " MacBook Pro .
sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move .
This computer was awful !
Turns out this is a common problem .
This computer was bought because I wanted " top of the line " , fast , reliable , HA .
It is amazing .
A * big * upgrade from my 13 " 2006 macbook .
Keyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel .
I would tell the technician I knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and I had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me I needed to send the computer in .
It is light and the battery last a very long time .
I could n't believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge .
I love WIndows 7 which is a vast improvment over Vista .
Bought with a credit card .
It is not ideal for children because of the temp .
But while this is one big advantage ( as you may know from the company s recent commercials ) there are other things to consider before going with Apple .
If it 's not shipped on the next business day , called on a Friday they are closed on weekends , what was the next step .
they respond : " your dissatisfaction is noted " ...
More likely it will require replacing the logic board once they admit they have a problem and come up with a solution .
Apparently there is a manufacturing defect , something with the amount of thermal paste .
Was very much worth the price i paid .
Another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed $ 175 to send it in to fix it .
think i would spend little extra to get a better made laptop .
I still have that stupid bluetooth mouse to !
So when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand .
Will probably never buy a HP again .
Battery is not upgradable to a longer life battery .
I 'M SO HAPPY WITH MY macbook pro !
1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in .
I also made a recovery USB stick .
air has higher resolution but the fonts are small .
The newer black keyboard took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick , but it is still a great notebook !
It has a lot of memory and a great battery life .
NO good .
It was wonderful deal for the wonderful product .
But enough about that , I am an Apple convert for life .
I paid for a new laptop , but was sent a used one .
Browsing , also , was no problem for me when I used itunes ( which usually slows down my PC ) .
