stayed up all night trying to figure out that thing .
i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3-year - old unit again just to see .
i saw another review saying his only gripe was a lack of voice dialing .
the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did .
it 's nothing major , just a bad hard drive , any hard drive mp3 player can have that problem .
other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .
i am a nikon fan , and owned and used slr nikon fe , n50 and n90s for many many years .
the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .
worked for two weeks .
all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n't done it since .
it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ).
the fm radio is cool .
if you 're a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rock-bottom price , i highly recommend this model .
my story is based on personal usage .
i then installed the software manually instead , after having to click past about 5 windows of " please register with us so we can spam your inbox " .
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .
great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .
i did quite a bit of research before buying this camera , and this one had everything i was looking for .
all rechargeable batteries lose their holding power over time ( around 2 years ) .
there have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time , upon powering it up it starts on the " now playing " screen with a song or cd that i had been playing days before .
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .
no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic 's for just a couple of keepers .
but the earbuds suck !
so how can i do that ... are n't that free for two after the rebates .
oh well ..
again , you can change this , but it 's harder to spot a minor variation in the title when you do n't have the title of the other disk in front of you .
it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls .
not sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear .
bought the apex ad-2600 from amazon in 12/03 mainly on price , $ 49.99 - $ 10 rebate = $ 39.99 .
with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation .
my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .
to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ;
one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .
the ipod is also an attractable piece , being lightweight and small .
you should too .
i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .
the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .
software downloads on the site crashed my pc .
i just transfered over some 40 cds and have plenty of space left for me .
not many .
my sister has this series of phone and she loves the radio and headset .
in a quick summation , here is what i found .
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .
( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n't play and they were new ones !
a good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images .
that 's important because i have a lot of music .
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house , that one didn " t work either !
i did have some problems figuring out how to turn the unit on , but creative did a good job with this , as they had a clearly labled " on " button that i found when i left my cellar for the first time in years .
it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .
after installing it and trying to make it working for 30 minutes i went and bought notmad .
unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .
i would be nice to have a simple fm receiver so i could pick up local stations .
now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it !
now where did i put that manual ?
there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !
basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n't used .
this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .
the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .
sheesh ! !
i 'd have given it 5 stars , but i 'm waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one :
1 ) a spare battery would have been great .
since the zen xtra does not use a folder structure , the " duplicate name " problem stems from the actual file name , not from the song 's title / artist / album .
by the way my alias dvds are legit too not no bootleg from the internet .
gee ... thanks a lot creative .
go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense .
the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses !
the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on .
as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you wont scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys .
from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .
my cuzin got an ipod and i wo n't say it is an awful product , but i will say that for the price , apple could do better as far as storage and battery life goes .
this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .
however , if you are keen , you can attach a camera to this phone .
notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx .
i bought the apex ad-2600 because of the ability to play jpegs and it seemed like it was the most bang for the buck .
also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 " tv ).
buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever .
the case had ad2600 .
i like the default blue .
2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .
the battery life is amazing .
the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .
this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .
the nokia , samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do n't talk too much .
the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an " auto " mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .
charged my battery .
enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure .
so all you do is stick a pin or something small in the reset button & you 're golden .
( my orignal review is below : )
a disipointed customer .
i love photography .
let 's face it - when you want to watch a movie you want to see a picture .
if i knew then what i know now i would have paid the extra to get an ipod & avoided the zen .
that 's all for now .
also , i downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates .
this would have been much easier .
it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much .
1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 " or 5x7 " prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 " photos once in a while .
i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .
in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .
lastly , the price is fantastic :
you will find it very hard or impossible to get you money back .
1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .
very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has .
1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .
a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .
just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .
bottom line for me is that for the price i do n't think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player .
after much frustration ( above ) i found the notmad explorer ; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer & organization problems .
the only creative software i am using is the device driver ( s ).
the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .
contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .
i do n't have a dvd + r to try
you can get weather , movies , horoscopes and more with a few clicks .
small size .
i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine .
here 's something you have to know before you considering about buying this one .
based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal .
after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds .
it also covers over the power jack when closed .
the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla .
the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too .
it focuses in a snap .
much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate
but there are certain issues might be they are to me here - all of them are minor; not major ones though ,
canon 's g3 does it consistently .
do yourself a favor and save your money to get something of better quality , or at least works .
these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .
i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever .
i love this camera .
they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .
it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .
my choices at that moment were to manually re-tag my music or re-rip using mediasource .
if you want the other accessories the ipod offer , maybe that 's where you should go .. .
it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .
my office would not let me put the software on to my work computer .
with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it .
now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk .
yet they 've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone , including italian , german , and dutch .
other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .
another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you .
+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit
the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .
it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed-light settings .
i bought an ipod and am very happy with it .
do too many stuffs to get to a free phone after rebate .
this is not a player you can take jogging .
sometimes you skip past things or have to press it twice to select items .
you could have paid more and got a lot less .
the first one was the 705 which i hacked successfully to play all region dvds and disable macrovision .
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .
forget about it .
if you decide to encode at 320 you will fit less on this device than someone who encodes at 128kps .
but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. .
but there are faceplates to replace it i guess ...
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .
cheaper in every way .
there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote .
night mode is clear as day .
the service from the supplier was exceptional .
many reviewers say the faceplate simply did n't fit well so they returned the zen .
just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos .
it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .
so why lie about it ?
also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore " the " when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .
when plugged in , it does n't lag the computer like the archos did ... unless you are doing a massive transfer of data in one load .
the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .
a remote would have been cool too ... but lets not push it .
once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .
i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 !
if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe .
alright , well i read alot of these reviews , and i read alot of bad and good things about this player .
it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds .
when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was .
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds .
i paid $ 49 and now it 's $ 125 !
yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway .
navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites .
hard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory ) .
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .
now as others said , so far this player is an awesome player , there are flaws .
- included creative software is pretty poor .
i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box .
it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier .
the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .
added 2-24 .
i just used the explorer program to move my songs to my player .
the sound quality is very good .
you can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions .
i do n't think i was asking too much .
it has never worked .
i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting .
another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on .
nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .
this is pretty cool .
this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks .
this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features .
the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )
i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .
for ipod you have to buy a cable and it is n't compatible with all windows pcs.
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .
huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .
for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer .
it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .
the ad-1600 did n't work corectly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up .
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .
longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .
the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked .
great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes
try to buy a high capacity ultra card , as it 's 2x as faster as the regular cf card .
i am enjoying my phone a lot ....
sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .
i guess that i can not complain since it does not actually claim to play vcd / svcd formats , but others say they can .
granted , i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player .
the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .
another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
the door would not close .
all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .
the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .
the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .
the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )
but this camera is great !
this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. .
warning - i did read the manual !
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par .
the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras .
if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .
the reason for this the ipod has " a better user interface " .
especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations .
unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed .
works great !
there 's a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330 , especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures .
there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .
3 ) user replaceable battery
lot 's of other features that i need to find out about .
i tried called apex cust service , no help .
all of the zens use a standard notebook drive .
this provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( .
-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .
accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .
on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .
i finally joined the 21st century and bought this dvd player .
what the hell is wrong with this thing .
this was the closest alternative and best buy for this type .
i tried re-setting it , i tried just about every pair of headphones in my house ( 10 pairs ) , and nothing worked .
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category .
all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift .
poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .
i could crush this thing in half with two fingers if i wanted to .
another stupid move .
( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however )
- large easy readable screen
i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all .
ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
there 's a dent on the upper-back-right and lower-back-right corners ... not too obvious unless you 're up close .
so now it still plays everything , you just can 't see it !
also , if i had already loaded and tagged by cds on my home computer , this would not have been an issue .
i have to rip everything as a 160 kbps wma file ( as opposed to 128 kbps mp3 ) to avoid hearing digital garbling .
i got this a while ago knowing nothing about it .
( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too .
price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .
it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .
well , it was nice while it lasted .
mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them .
the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ahwile .
the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .
worse of all , they claim that it 's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty !
once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers .
6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .
the software you get with this camera is perfect .
the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use .
the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .
i used it lightly , and it lasted just over one year ( forgot to kill the power one day , and now it only plays dvds ).
this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .
i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast .
i bought this phone when it first came out in the summer .
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .
it makes the dvd player to switch between interlace mode and progressive scan mode .
i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 .
the dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model .
i love the quality of the pictures .
if you are skeptical about trying apex .
this is a great investment for someone like me who enjoys music and hates carrying multiple cds .
choosing zennx is a no-brainer when factoring in the cost of a new $ 400 + ipod every few years versus the $ 50 cost of replacing zennx 's rechargeable battery .
i purchased this as a christmas gift for my husband .
i treat the battery well and it has lasted .
one horrible flaw , or mayybe more than one .
so far the player froze on me once ( i started pushing buttons before it loaded ) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that .
well i decided to get this one .
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
* sigh .
5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .
it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .
each of the 4 lasted less than six months .
but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback .. . i can 't recommend this product .
i hope i have helped you continue to enjoy the apex dvd player with these troubleshooting tips .
i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .
i use a 128mb card , and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 1024-1280 res. , with good resolution .
this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .
7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view .
i just bought the camera a few days ago .
i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
you can change any of these , but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it .
sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .
nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .
remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s .
so if you use your card reader ; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date ; time .
first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .
but you might find my review useful , nonetheless .
because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's .
this problem vanished after the first month , so i assume it was a temporary dust issue .
but it works perfectly fine on my parent 's computer .
if you are planning to buy that player , do not !
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .
the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .
basically wat happened , is that the hard drive failed .
that meant even less light and just as much action .
and go from there ... if you chose one of the " all " options , then you do n't need to do anything until it 's done .
unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs .
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings .
had to buy my dad a different dvd player locally ( panasonic ) which worked just fine .
people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant .
i might have gotten a lemon , but this is not the first report of video output failure on this machine .
4 ) a set of speakers and a wireless transmitter are accessories that will add to your player 's usability ( the latter will allow you to play it on your car radio , home receiver , etc. )
getting the printer to help output them was another tale .
the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .
after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends , i bought this nokia 6610 .
now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems .
strike 1 .
apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .
that takes up half the space of mp3 's .
first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds .
wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker !
further , the xtra doubles the maximum filecount capacity to 16000 mp3 .
i purchased a jukebox 3 from creative almost a year ago .
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .
i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .
i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will .
different people have different needs , of course , but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive .
the ipod 's white plastic look / surface does n't suit me .
i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .
one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .
my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity .
it was either the 40gb ipod or this one .
i quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me .
what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies .
so now i 've got to call their customer " service " ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back .
so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .
how does it sound ?
bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price .
you can always spend more money to get a better one .
i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily .
my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .
i do recommend getting the data kit for those geeks .
there was neither picture nor sound .
( i guess only time will tell ? )
here 's where the ipod drives me nuts .
you can customize bass , etc. like usual , but also you can customize the sound of the player ( like how it would sound in a concert hall , jazz club , etc ).
spend the extra 20 $ and buy a name brand dvd player .
now , i suddenly have no picture .
i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason .
here 's a hint : go to nokia.com and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth .
nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .
they fall in love with the product .
all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved .
i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow !
a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .
value : comparing data storage with price .
first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .
i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile .
it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .
- some features in the user interface
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .
i 've got 1200 songs on it now and about 4000 more to go .
what task do they perform ?
output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv .
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .
it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches .
i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice .
it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman .
another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it .
just before we all spent a couple weeks in an rv together .
to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
it 'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it .
i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone .
i got an rma from creative , sent my player in to them for repairs .
the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures .
i would n't gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas .
navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .
i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .
so far not going to get a good review .
card reader is included .
had i not been in such a hurry to load cds , i would have spotted them sooner .
the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd .
the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life .
i have owned an apex ad-3201 for close to 3 years now and i love that deck .
so what 's the problem ?
and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control .
bummer as it has great sound quality .
that way i could keep it in the case all the time .
i can only hear the sound .
after about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player .
like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it .
it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .
and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .
the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's .
this is the best dvd player i 've purchased .
does n't always register push-button movement .
i just got screwed out of fifty bucks .
i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .
8mb for a camera like this is a joke .
i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar .
the cd will be classified into a number of genres , and in multidisk sets , you can get separate classifications for different disks by the same artist and the same performance .
zens rule .
i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .
this meant that i had to take all my cds and do in a fairly short period of time what i had done over a year at work .
if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .
- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .
also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .
do n't waste your time , engery , resources on this thing , just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod .
one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) .
3 ) folders cannot be created for the audio files .
no issues as of yet
3 ) you must press the play button and hold it for a couple of seconds otherwise it will not work and you will think the whole unit is broken .
get it , it 's woth every penny ! !
i got this dvd player as a gift and had to send it back .
so far the software for the pc works easily .
it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set .
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money .
when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :
furher it contains a card reader , a flash card folder for up to 8 cards , a lense cleaning rag , and an ac adapter , which is very helpful when working in an " outlet environment " .
the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .
well , this apex dvd player turned out great !
i purchased this phone after having been an at &#38; t subscriber with a nokia 8260 phone for over three years .
i am still trying to figure out the may options it has .
so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .
games are ok for a cell phone , but mp3 's are for music .
yes , the features are numerous .
my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .
however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .
and since the current language selection was english ( even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were " ? " s and even though the songs had different names in chinese ..
5 for " digital film " it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome .
80 % of the features on here you will not get by spending $ 100 on a sony or panasonic .
for those of you using a mac in os x+ there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop .
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows " no disc . "
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb .
with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet .
do not recommend .
player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 .
save them on computer and print out just the ones who want .
i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response .
it 's a very intuitive program .
i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time .
here 's why :
i bought this only to have it break within a month .
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the " rigor " of a business traveler .
after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd .
it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .
all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet ; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while .
after using the bulky 3650 for three weeks , i searched for a smaller alternative .
i will never buy another apex digital product !
for prospective buyers , i would warn of the following : 1 ) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible , as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable ( this applies to earbuds in general , ) and 2 ) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them , that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves .
good thing i got a replacement plan .
this camera performs like i can not believe !
picture this :
i wish it would do the same for movies , but that 's one rare / cool feature you will have to forgo .
you will be told goldstar codes work , and you will be told zenith codes will work , and radio shack will give you apex codes but they will not work .
i am a software engineer and if i wrote an interface to my software that worked like this , there would be hell to pay , not to mention the ridicule from my peers .
the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .
i just put it on " shuffle " , sit back , and enjoy the eclectic mix that almost 3,000 tunes offer !
you can also delete songs from the player itself , and create playlists - on the fly - on your player .
i got every song i had downloaded to the player within a day or so .
the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .
i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular .
the service from t-mobile is very good too .
you can sort your music by artist , title , album , or genre , and you can play music based on those categories .
the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .
i have used this phone for two months now .
in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it .
on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good .
had no problem with it .
so now i keep it in my pocket .
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .
after playing with this little device , i do n't know why i would look at an ipod with the same space when it costs $ 500 and i got mine for a little more than half that price !
you can also set a background wallpaper .
sometimes when i get really lonely , i like to put on some kenny g and light some candles , and while this does n't help , i am a capitalist pig and like buying things too , nah mean ! ?
software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .
thats it .
not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .
their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .
2 ) storage capacity
and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .
so much packed in a small case and very affordable !
the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .
cons summary :
1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .
by the way , it looks nice also .
one of the things t-mobile brags about is the fact that it 's a " worldphone " and can be used in europe , etc.
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing .
thankfully amazon has free return shipping !
as mentioned above i broke the player within the 1st 10 days .
get one now !
many people recommended the ipod , and i borrowed one from a friend .
this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .
it was no problem for me to use their software .
you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself .
i do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand .
i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .
unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds. even though they were not damaged in any way .
first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .
i 've even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive .
using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account .
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .
you can easily access ur files , and easily fill in the id3 tags , which can take a while with a big collection of music , but if your not lazy , you will do it without a problem .
the phone does have voice dialing according to amazon & t-mobile and nokia .
i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 .
the dvd player just would't recognize them .
i bought this as a gift for my sister .
- bright , visible screen
2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax .
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy .
for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience .
the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .
one thing i should note is that i have only had this product for one day , so there are many options i have not explored .
" check out " !
the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful " scene " mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless .
for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds .
size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .
however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much .
the image quality is excellent .
that said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory .
* removable battery
their website does not show it as a compatible phone , and should i try to access the game downloads on t-zones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported .
get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash .
now i have to return it and rip all my music again .
for those of you who has problems with this player , i 'd suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture , etc.
the t610 has the most functionality hands down .
i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra .
to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power .
the plus points are -
i bought this last week through amazon .
now let 's talk about the software .
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of " now playing " interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .
i enthusiastically recommend this camera .
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .
excellent range of metering options as well .
flash card memory vs. hard drive ( i.e. why does a 256 mb player cost $$$...and a 40 gb ( 40,000 mb ) player only cost
the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .
i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .
the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .
i am still trying to resolve the problem with the second one .
however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .
construction quality is a difficult item .
. go ; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card .
boy was i wrong .
i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .
it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .
i think that it is a were good mobile phone and i may buy it .
i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) .
sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .
i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it !
the prints are beautiful !
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .
it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here .
prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture .
the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .
if you are going to need a player that is rugged this may not be the one for you .
when you load a disc , you go to an internet cite for the insertion of the names for the cd and the tracks .
you have to buy better ones .
based on hardware one could assume the archos players were horrible ( which by hardware standards .. . they were ) .. .
30gb is more than enough for most people .
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
i applied a $ 25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying $ 29 for this machine .
makes me use it much less than i otherwise would .
the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !
only the cheap and poor would buy one .
surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .
the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight .
it also costs a lot less than the ipod .
its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .
but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. .
i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards .
creative provided e-mail support ;
to me this alludes to the manufacturer 's confidence that the product will last for a year .
i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it .
sure it 's " old school " to carry a cd wallet around , but it will be easier to manage and i 'll save around 250 bucks .
they look fantastic .
do n't walk , run and buy this camera if you have the budget , i guarantee you will not be disappointed .
this gap allowed the front panel to fly off after barely being touched .
this phone is a winner ...
umm , well , thanks for nothing .
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture .
i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode .
if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .
i have 100 of my cd 's transferred and have n't made a dent in the 30 gb drive .
the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .
with progressive scan , i expect it to play play play - and give my old pioneer a rest .
i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar .
i 've had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola , sony ericsson , nokia etc. ) and in my opinion , nokia has the best menus and promps hands down .
i was a little disappointed in the low end .
keeps coming up with no disk errors .
whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card , usb card reader , camera bag and the warranty .
this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he 'd answered all my questions ( same interaction as i just described ) , and well .. .
did i mention i 've already dropped it once ?
i have tried the belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter but found there was too much interference .
with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;
( good going , amazon ).
now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
it plays everything , even vcd 's .
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack .
so far the dvd works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i 've read .
i am going to have to try an online download and see if that works .
the p/n button switches your dvd players video output signal between pal and ntsc .
i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out .
the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .
since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work " in 24 hours " .
like i said , when the moment is gone , it is gone .
( 28 not 30 because software itself takes space ) .
the good news is if you can 't get it to reset / reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it .
pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !
i bought this for my dad for christmas .
this is a powerful piece of equipment .
great features . .
the player 's mechanics are also flawed .
it is a beast .
i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway .
fm receiver - it has none .
anyway , on with the review .
the price / performance looked just right .
as i emailed to the the customer service department , the only thing this player has done consistantly is use enought electricity to keep the red led burning .
sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !
great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .
buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .
i was prepared to love it .
and we all know about the rush to market on new products .
for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .
notmad has other features too , but this is not an advertisement so please see the company 's web site for more information ...
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine .
the cd just has too many problems with win xp .
i did already have mediasource installed due to owning the creative audigy 2 soundcard but i did need to re-install it from the supplied cd as the older version did not have the connector to the zen .
i would recommend this product to anyone .
we 'll see if i need them to .
best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .
do not buy this product or any apex product unless you are looking to be frustrated and lose money !
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .
i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case .
depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .
if this doesnt bring back the picture , try pressing this button without playing a dvd .
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .
i would not give up this phone for the world .
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .
compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .
no go on most formats .
my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands .
some of my friends had well branded dvd-players but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks !
sold in other parts of the world :
transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 .
4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery 's out is not included , although one can be purchased separately .
it referred to a " microsoft jet database engine " error and the install program suggested i download a service pack from the ms website to fix the problem ;
i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty . ( it 's fast too ! )
after using it for a few weeks ( the amount of time before the hard drive crashed ) it revealed a few of its shortcommings .
mixed bag i guess but the price was right .
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .
i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond .
therefore im saying im returning it right now , and i will see wat happens with my next zen xtra ( same replacement ) .
the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc. other nicities , that you would enjoy .
i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way .
a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )
i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died .
i am new to the whole digital camera thing ; well , new to the whole camera thing period , really .
whatever you do , do n't buy this product .
i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged .
at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my " alias " dvds as well .
there have been other occurrences of locking , but i will not bore you with the details .
is this possible to fix , if so how , if not does notmad explorer from red chair software do this ?
i love the storage in this thing .
using the remote control , press the i/p button located on the bottom right corner of the remote .
there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free .
i would recogmend this player to anyone i know , and you will not be dissapointed .
if you happen to push the wrong button , you can wipe out the order of songs you had put in .
maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use .
have had the player since xmass and love it !
2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .
it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .
many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .
and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
called customer service and basically was told to either keep buying univ. remotes to try or buy the replacement remote for $ 23 ( which is almost half of what i paid for the whole player ) .
great phone , i 'd buy another .
i end up unplugging it from the wall for a few hours and when i try again it will work fine.at least until this problem arises again .
it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly .
first let me give you the bad things :
the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .
if that is for you then pay the money , learn from the experience and you 'll be a more informed buyer when you buy device # 2 .
but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n't anticipate any problems with it .
the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .
only one disk played through to completion successfully .
i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile " hot-spots " .
so if you have xp , be prepared for this and do n't be alarmed .
even better , ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap .
crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time .
third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .
the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .
the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !
overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it .
good points :
sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod .
at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe 's photoshop elments 2.0 software , and can 't praise it highly enough .
this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .
hope the unit lasts as i 've only had it for 3 days .
but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there .
although you may think you 're dealing with amazon , you 're dealing with some second rate store that you 've never heard of .
i think you get what you pay for stands true .
it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .
i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .
an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper .
in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % .
if the casing of the player is this bad , i can 't image that the hardware is of very good quality .
i went to an at &#38; t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads .
in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .
i called them twice and both times they said it is " about to ship " .
oh my goodness --
the reasons below will be true for any product in this category .
overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do .
i purchased the extended warranty ( something i almost never do ) when i returned the unit to get the replacement .
considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
the nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six .
3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip .
given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .
the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .
i was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke .
have had problems since the first day
well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze .
it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk .
it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .
frequent signal searches eat up battery power .
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .
it did have scored over all other competitors ....
i have a large but not huge cd collection and have loaded everything i want to listen to on it and still have 13 gigabytes free .
the light auto-correction is awesome .
duplicates are a no brainer and cheap .
as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .
i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .
i would say that this is not a major issue , but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things .
this bumpy is wicked groovy .
but who wants the wires involved .
one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .
it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .
i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes .
the regular mode in this camera works for 80 % of settings .
no matter the format .
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .
the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .
a great buy .
if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books .
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .
this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags .
1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one .
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play .
with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .
the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .
the zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced .
* lens visible in optical viewfinder .
the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .
compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use .
they said it is in stock , but they are " too busy " .
recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
review of zen xtra - 40 gb
i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !
it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
i should point out that the new rio karma is now down to about $ 280 and is reviewed readily as being as good as ( and better in some areas ) the ipod .
nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .
it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .
for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c .
i wish i could give negative stars !
it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls .
i 'd like a camera phone , but i 'd rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls ...
i love the pros and cons reviews so here ya go :
i purchased two apex 2600 for christmas presents .
i definately recommend a large memory card .
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
apex sucks !
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen .
be advised , however , that you may encounter problems .
i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .
i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .
the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend .
when the player was working it was great ,but .
the workaround is to update id3 tags on your files ( through mediasource ) but it can be a hassle if you have many such music files .
after investigating a multitude of player options , i asked for and received the 60 gb zen xtra for christmas .
every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone .
the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .
it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work , because it works on all the other computers i have .
but heck it plays my alias dvds .
so far i 've played regular dvd 's , backup dvd-r 's , mp3 cd 's , and regular cd 's .
unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box .
the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel
i received the apex ad-2600 before i expected .
the ipod uses a smaller ( and more expensive ) drive ( 1.8 " ) .
a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .
messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .
but i did n't because i 'm used to electronic products having a 12 month warranty .
the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button .
before jumping on the ipod train , take a look at this marvel .
great quality picture and features .
i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !
pros summary :
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again .
the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place .
can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go .
8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ).
the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
i am still trying to resolve it four months later .
i bought this player during a christmas sale at an excellent price .
the pc quickly picked up on it and attempted to install the software , which failed , as creative chose not to follow microsoft standards , whatever .
but with a low price , comes lower quality .
i was planning on getting an ipod , but i changed my mind last minute ... mostly because of the whole battery issue , i do n't have the patience for those sorta things .
it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :
i was told that it is no longer available , so there must be something really wrong with it .
i personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad .
it is connected to an old television set via composite video and analog audio outputs .
24 hours ?
if you 're like me , that will definitely make you pause .
the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough .
- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .
i chose the canon speedlite 420 .
11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player
please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used .
anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix .
but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .
controls easy yo use and easy to get to .
also , if you 're an audiophile , you 'll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short .
i would recommend buying one .
for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button , a ring around the enter / play button .
there should have been a recall on this product .
you can even skip that step and rip them directly from the cd to the player .
i returned to the store , whereupon the clerk insisted that he could make it work ; he could n't .
i purchased one of these to replace an ailing dvd player that 's a few years old .
i have been trying for over a week to contact apex .
the entire unit was poorly crafted .
this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .
for the money , get a better quality player .
the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .
it 's not a big deal for me .
you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit
otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .
most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist .
buy this camera and savour it .
this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters .
some of the more geeky ( non-apple type ) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface .
first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .
although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .
i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots .
i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him .
i can 't fit all that resolution ( 4mp = 2272x 1704 resol . ) in my 19in flat monitor ( 1200x1024 resol . ) anyways .
what a mistake !
i 'm not sure if it would survive a fall from 3 feet .
if you have always on internet or are logged into the internet you can use the feature that will download the album & song id information ( this is a free service ) with the click of a button .
nice little phone ... light compact . .
when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .
however , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution .
transferred the zens new software onto it in about 10 seconds .
you wo n't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans.
let me quote a customer service rep from one of the authorized apex service locations in my state ( they only service apex tv 's , not dvd players ) :
that was annoying .
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies .
zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .
nokia does not disappoint in this model .
that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce .
* protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window .
i did buy the telephoto lens ( and the required extension ) .
you get what you pay for .
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .
basic shipping was a bit slow , but that 's okay .
also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .
the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone " unlike the nokia 3650 " and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make ...
finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier .
the other controls are all very easy to use .
i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .
but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. .
it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs .
you have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to , instead of just connecting it with a usb connection .
e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage
3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players
in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !
you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them .
3 ) 4x zoom is nice
which was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone ...
i can 't speak to its long-term reliability , as i 've only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point .
i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player .
i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .
i have n't checked the resilience of my xtra yet , and do n't plan to .
i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition .
i 've owned 6 or 7 dvd players since 1998 .
the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla .
but i would expect that , since my movie discs have all played with no problem , the extras discs would , too , without any additional tweaking .
sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task .
the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .
it 's easy .
the lcd screen was very large and readable .
you just have to use the lcd viewfinder to see the whole picture .
for the price and features it is really good .
what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it .
as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .
no line out jack - as i said , there is none .
i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker .
the phone is small , light , and very attractive .
however , if anyone has participated in violent or extreme sports while using their zen , please share your experiences .
i pulled out our old non-progressive scan toshiba , hooked it back-up and the " finding nemo " dvd works fine .
but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately .
no contact phone number , only eamil contact which did not respond me .
the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
ok this is our first dvd player so what do i know .
as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) .
i realize this is for quality assurance purposes , but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered ( i.e. me :
this thing does its job .
really quiet .
so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price !
there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize .
the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive .
the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .
that 's a huge difference ... especially in this price range .
therefore , if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card , even if you unlock the phone , there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet .
hopefully the replacement from amazon will work just fine .
if it were not for that i would have given it 4 .
typically people use 96kbs to 320 kps.
despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography .
as said before this works perfectly .
bought two ad2600 's for christmas .
the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god .
creative labs customer support website is useless .
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com
they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .
i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since .
and so far , i 've been very pleased .
i got mine for $ 160 less than the ipod 30gb ( got an extra $ 30 off for applying for an amazon visa ... thanks amazon ! )
maybe more competitors will bring out similar products .
it can get pretty lonely out there .
my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the " year " field .
