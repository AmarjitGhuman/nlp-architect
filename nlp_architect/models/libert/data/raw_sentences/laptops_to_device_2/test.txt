the bottom line :
( 1 gb = 1,000 mb )
the devices competing with the ipod are the iriver ihp 120 , the rio karma , and the philips hdd100 .
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .
had this been my only dvd player , though , it would have been a real problem .
perhaps there is a tone of irony in the title of my review , but i actually mean it in earnest .
i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .
my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone .
i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .
the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .
if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !
the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .
1 no direct firewire to the camera .
i intend to contact the company , but from what i 've read .
it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !
i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on .
after receiving the box from amazon , i proceeded with charging the unit for the specified 4 hours , after which i installed the software and connected the unit to my pc via usb 2.0 .
now i can transport files to friends house with ease .
thank you very much , and go out and get yourself a nomad !
1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .
this is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining mp3 's in which i would have never purchased the cd .
save yourself some aggrivation .
but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .
so what are you waiting for ?
i paid twenty dollars more than the current price , and even then it was a steal .
- no propietary headset jack
i am not talking milliseconds .
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .
perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy " off " brands .
it wo n't play 80 % of my movies , which are all store boughten .
often i fill i need to have better organization for the library and there is not enought of variables .
there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc .
a few things that might make it even better :
the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .
for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .
it is great to no longer wonder what music i want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip - now i just take everything .
he spent another half hour on the phone with tech support , to no avail .
having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .
up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .
in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .
it practically plays almost everything you give it .
i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .
the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue .
if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ).
the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .
one bad thing though , i find the remote control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does .
i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :
i do n't think so .
i just sold my archos 20gb jukebox recorder after not being satisfied with it 's slow loading & difficult navigation , not to mention it froze quite a bit .
you can also search for your song , which is good .
i own a 35mm slr camera and this is my second digital .
i finally returned the unit to the company along with copies of my messages and return info .
not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem .
and also , it 's priced very affordably .
player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play .
it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates .
i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .
hi , many people are saying , " you get what you pay for , i guess . "
audio on video also lacking .
but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .
that way i could get rid of a walkman alltogether .
the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it .
nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke .
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .
from what i 've heard it 's at least equal .
one thing puzzles me is that for " fine and 2200 + " quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .
the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly .
it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .
but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .
updating the unit 's firmware :
if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .
there is n't need to get in details again , but just remember it rocks because : price , sound , ease of use , and features .
i 'm not looking forward to ripping my entire collection every month or two .
this is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to " easy listening " rather than " heavy metal " - no problem .
the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
i received this dvd player free with the purchase of a palm tungsten e from officemax .
i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move .
more downside to this phone ?
go for it ...
my brother bought an ipod this past summer and my dad bought the original zen around the same time ..
after fiddling around with it for a while , i notice a few dissapointments :
huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you .
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n't had any problems .
i 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder .. .
the features are really cool like the radio .
no difference .
5 . the 1/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments .
well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .
we did n't get to use it again for over a month ( sad , i know ) .
you can get a pretty good progressive scan sony or toshiba now for 68 bucks just about anywhere .
case - the nomad comes with a leather holding case .
( i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead ) .
if you watch one dvd per weekm its yours .
now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos .
the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) .
imagine my shock - and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex .
this is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway .
and have returned both .
it was just a problem with the player .
i 've compared this phone to others such as 6100 , siemens sl55 .
otherwise it 'll get there the day you get back from the hospital !
overall this is a slightly better than average phone .
bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations .
btw , be sure to have your mp3 tags labled correctly , as this will ensure a great organization .
needless to say , i would n't recommend anyone purchasing this product .
i did n't use it long enough to know , but clearly you need to use it with caution .
creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery .
2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .
video output stopped workin .
honestly , the best players without any flaws were the goddam cd players .
do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype .
the player controls are too easy to hit accidentally .
like most people , i do n't want to read the instructions , i just want to use it .
i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem .
working for 10 hours with it on " shuffle " totally rocks ! !
i think this is it 's biggest flaw .
the screen 's large and easily read .
it 's money down the drain .
-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).
even if there happened to be identical track titles on the same disc , you could still edit the file name manually and get them both onto the player .
the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc .
oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone , but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam .
flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .
also , the lens cap design is flawed .
yes the ipod is smaller , but not $ 200 worth , which is the premium you 'll pay for an equivalent capacity model .
this is all i have to say .
it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice .
they would n't repair my camera unless if i pay $ 100 for parts ? and labor !
but who cares ?
i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .
her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use .
before i decided to get this player , i did my research .
overall design :
the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .
i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information .
with our compact 35mm broken , and a vacation in europe at hand , i finally decided to enter the digital age .
software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better , but costs money )
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?
the camera has a wonderful set of features .
got a great deal from a reputable seller .
the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day ( although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life ) .
b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .
you do n't have this problem if you make your playlist from the nomad , where cds are listed separately .
so you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter , but you do n't get the quality from a true line out jack .
as i travelled internationally and did n't want to haul it back on a plane with me it was an expensive addition to the recycling bin .
that is a very nice feature .
i experimented with installing mediasource on 2 other computers at home and it worked fine .
. if you want to have the date ; time on the image , its only through their software " nikon view " which reads the images date ; time from the images meta-data .
now i need to buy myself another one !
what a junk .
when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .
i can only hear the sound but no picture !
compusa , memorex , fuji .
if not i will avoid apex products in the future .
i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work .
the nomad is sent back to creative labs .
through the software you can classify songs in genres .
the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat . clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .
if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for .
read the directions !
2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called " unknown . "
they sent me a new ad2600 with the same problem .
the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .
it seems like movement , even small movement , causes skipping in playback and even the device freezing .
great phone .. .
as i travel quite a lot , i 'd want something with gsm as well as cdma tri-band .
the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .
we got a 256mb card , and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend .
it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .
olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body .
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .
i love this player .
i am a soldier serving in baghdad right now .
well , anyway i could go on and on on why this player did n't meet my expectations .. .
all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .
this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ).
the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .
i have had no problems with the phone .
( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . )
the files are there , but i could not access the player without removing the battery , waiting a short period and re-inserting the battery .
the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad .
got it for christmas , still learning a few of the settings , but i do n't take pictures every single day .
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .
i bought this dvd player in november .
i bought the player this week and i like it by far .
people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone .
the general button placement is not very user-friendly .
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .
we also looked at the fuji fps602 .
it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented .
apple 's solution - pay apple another $ 400 + for a new ipod ( less a paltry discount ) .
a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer .
i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) .
in fact , my boyfriend is now going to invest into one of these suckers as well ... now he realizes that this is the best choice over his current archos and the ipod he was eyeing .
this camera will stay with me for years !
only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much .
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e. , mp3s ) .
not an urgent issue , as it still works .. .
scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .
both creative and third-party powered speakers work great , as do third-party wireless transmitters .
finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy .
i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any product ) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes .
the 20 gig ipod still goes for just under $ 400 .
had it for a week .
i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it .
there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation .
as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !
i forgot , the case does n't fit .
i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation .
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .
2 ) buy a good pair of head-phones unless you already own one .
a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .
i am returning it , and again in the market for a multiformat dvd , svcd , vcd , mp3 , etc. player .
the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .
after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support .
i purchased the ad2600 after feeling comfortable with the reviews i read here on amazon .
size - bigger than the ipod
a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop
but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !
and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .
i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times .
however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .
i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .
the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode .
i 'm very glad i did .
i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover .
nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .
now i dont have to lug around 80 cds if i dont know what i 'm going to want to listen to biking home .
some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .
here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .
what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ?
depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models .
so go and buy dis sucka beefo it all be gone an stuffff .
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it .
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .
the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .
this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .
i am a business user who heavily depend on mobile service .
they told me i would have to connect to my laptop , which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email .
you will have a very expensive paperweight .
there is usb , though .
i have an older computer , running windows 98 se , and so those of you with something more recent would find the process even quicker .
i highly recommend it .
2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow .
i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive .
i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .
they stop time .
i bought this to replace an expensive ( $ 300 + ) onkyo dvd player that quit after only 3 years !
here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of " plastic-like " ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .
the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number .
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --
mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs .
there 's no so-called background hiss that i 've noticed , at least so far .
i bought this player as a christmas present for my wife .
like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product .
beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .
the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering !
when it arrives , you press the shutter release .
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision .
after the first one fatally crashed , the replacement did not work .
all i am looking for is a rebate form !
because , you will be dissapointed .
this is a good deal for music and data storage .
if you have two tracks with exactly the same name on one disk , it will not copy both -- it gives you the option of skipping the second or overwriting the first with the second .
this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before .
" when will my t-zones work ? " , csr :
speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .
but canon never fails to amaze .
the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go .
save your cash - go for a brand that actually cares about their reputation .
ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .
if creative offered a 12-month warranty on their mp3 players , i 'd be covered .
canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .
1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its program and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings .
so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand .
otherwise , you 'll have to mess around a lot with filenames inside the ( decent ) nomad explorer , which is not fun at all .
the movie mode is also working great .
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual .
however , it has failed to deliver on quality .
its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .
i first intended to buy the 3100 , but am really happy to invest the extra money for the 4300 .
there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted .
i had downloaded about 1000 songs and had room for another 9000 !
i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control .
it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly .
cheaper to produce , holds a lot , heavier and has moving parts which means it 's a little more prone to damage from being banged around .
and how can i do that ... .
guess where this unit is headed ?
that is where my satisfaction ends .
one minor complaint :
headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .
- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last .
comes with standard rca jacks for output , along with s-video output ( s-video cable not included , must be purchased seperately ) and also component video outputs .
i used a canon powershot s20 for about 2.5 years and loved it !
this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .
i also did n't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode .
the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage .
it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .
this is the second apex dvd player i 've had - and the last .
all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at .
for a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones .
having 4000 or so mp3s , i never got more than 500 transfered .
print those coupons twice for two phones ?
the setup and transfer process was cake for me .
i 'd like to see my old carrier do that !
cameras capture moments .
the player kept displaying " no disc " , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * !
again had to remove the battery .
this is a great camera for you !
i was a little concerned to be the black sheep buying this player instead of the incredibly overpriced apple i-pod .
at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .
after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another , i got fed up and have decided to return the phone .
you have to ask yourself , " how much money is dissapointment worth ? "
or save time and just do it , you wo n't regret it .
third , the poor design continues with the case .
having to copy / delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage .
so it is probably " just bad luck " on my part that the personal notebook i own had this install error .
i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .
i am very pleased with it so far .
i got the 40gb jukebox zen xtra for christmas .
3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software .
it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system .
to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .
i simply watched the extra features on another player .
so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty !
+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .
on several different occasions it has displayed " no disc " with a disc inside .
the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .
the phone is very light weight .
ease of use :
if you 're copying cds with windows media , its really simple to give your songs id3 tags , so thats what i do .
buy new ones asap. every time you move your face or something they pop out .
so .. .
i have not yet tried the photo show capability , but i 'm thinking that will probably work well too , based on the success with the above mentioned disks .
do not buy this product --
it does n't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive .
i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .
at $ 49 .
also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy .
so i took it back to best buy where i bought it and exchanged it for a newer zen 20 gig model .
i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more .
it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .
for me , i 'll save that cash for another purchase .
i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still can 't get a video signal from the machine .
i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .
output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold .
also , it was only $ 39.99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player .
i am not associated with the company , i am not providing a url , but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily .
anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net , being able to download pics and ringtones ( not java apps , you need t-zones for that ) .
if you have any doubts about this player , well do n't .
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .
when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit .
prior to my switch to t-mobile , sprint was my service provider .
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 .
i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones .
the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .
remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons .
the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .
you will be sorry if you do .
purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it .
seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection .
the second one is up and running .
i was cruising around the device within 20 minutes .
i expect the g3 will please me for years to come .
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .
this is my fourth mp3 player ( creative nomad jukebox2 and 3 , rio chie , and this one ) , and my third player from creative .
what 's going on creative labs ?
i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along .
only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet .
maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again .
lastly , ipod / itunes will not play wma formatted songs .
win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs .
was i just unlucky at that moment ?
and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ).
i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .
i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far .
scroll bar :
the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .
i am surprised amazon still carries this after all of the continued problems .
extremely convenient .
not a big hassle as many would have you think .
i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .
i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner .
the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .
this is an edited review , now that i have had time to use the device .
you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck
that 's what i did and hopes this helps .
i agree with previous posts that you get what you pay for .
consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download , it 's well worth the little extra money .
it was marked up increadably high compared to other models ( almost $ 500 for a 30gb ) , and theres was nothing about it that made it worth that much money .
wow , dennis sure is great !
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting .
can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .
an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into " out of battery " situation .
now i have not owned other mp3 players as i was waiting until they matured , but since i received it as a gift i now have this one .
for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels .
i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player .
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .
this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas .
i only have one question , when i add tracks to my nomad , via nomad explorer , they are automatically put in alphebetical order , rather than album order .
of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest .
guess all that glitters is not gold .
the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .
autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .
the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .
and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem .
now , for the t-mobile service :
i ended up sending the unit back to amazon .
i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it .
the first one we installed did n't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least .
the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .
what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
* price and capacity
read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !
as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale .
go for it !
otherwise feedback seems to be good .
i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time .
i love the eos based controls and easy menus .
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .
excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
excellent idea !
for me the sound of the music is what is important .
i actually had to re-open the drawer and close it to get back to the dvd menu .
i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .
i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .
- no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking
while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .
i love it ! !
unlike some of the other people who received a " lemon " , my dvd player came in perfect working condition .
it always pays off .
i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .
many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .
i 'll admit that i 'd own an ipod if i had money to burn , but for the money this is a much better buy .
the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .
what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .
i did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras .
2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc. ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information .
even if it has n't expired , creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty .
any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor , along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support .
mediasource did not recognize my tags !
4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ).
a big plus in my book .
oh ... one more thing .
it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .
i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) .
i 'd look elsewhere .
also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) .
the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did .
i do n't want to install software and drivers on every computer i 'm ever at .
if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it .
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again .
the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
the description of the warranty is buried on the supplied set up cd .
for three months , i 've researched the internet and magazines , queried various sales personnel , and took hands-on in-store test drives .
i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time .
moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .
note : about 2gb ( 5 % ) of the advertised 40gb of storage capacity is used for the operating software ( firmware ) .
the ipod costs more for the same amount of memory .
the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key ) .
+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .
the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .
it works great .
we tried it out christmas night and it worked great .
i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable .
so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can 't use nomad until you get home .
almost there .
the karma does have a stop button .
they play just about everything , but # 2 and # 3 died very shortly after getting them .
you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .
if you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble .
looking at the glowing reviews from people that have had this for a week or two , i kind of wish people would wait until they 've had a product a little while to review it .
be forewarned .
i highly regret trying to save a few $ with this purchase .
maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
so i 'm screwed .
compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck .
4 ) it did play my jpeg photos but wow , trying to figure it out was really something !
well to say , i had a very bad history with players .
so i contacted customer service at creative , but they said , " if the product seems broken , we cannot help , " or something to that effect .
one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .
is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ?
in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .
in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it .
* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ).
eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs ( reviewers figures )
it happened to me once .
some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get .
four megapixels is great .
i was able to return it to the retailer where i bought it and got a replacement .
2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .
i will never use all the " whistles and bells " this machine is capable of .
it 's not the end of the world , but a better design sure would be nice .
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use .
most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy .
i bought the 2600 because it plays everything !
so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem .
when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .
then it rips the tunes into mp3s and puts them on your computer .
you can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later .
you can use the scene modes , or fine tune the options , i. you can change the iso level , shutter speed , etc.
take the time to fill in those tags !
sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization .
you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country .
it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up .
they refunded my $ $ $ so fast and paid for the shipping back .
the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that " creates " folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .
i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .
having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers .
do n't waste your money .
the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .
if you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now , but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you .
maybe i 'll get lucky with the next one .
i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .
i ordered two of these puppies for christmas gifts .
3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .
it really does n't make any cents $ $ to build a great reputation then destroy it from lack a research and testing in one season .
the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .
the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .
no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .
3 battery has to be removed to recharge .
this model has come down in price since i purchased mine .
the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .
i upgraded to a 6610 at my local t-mobile store .
i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .
the included memory card is too small .
always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .
i bought coolpix 4300 two months after i had bought canon powershot s400 .
because of this , i am disappointed and would not recommend this product .
one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched !
at the same time , i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons .
3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust .
i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion .
for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price .
just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it 's done !
i considered this phone ( nokia 6610 ) , mainly because of my sister and the features .
it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .
use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run .
you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .
10 great price for all the features .
hope someone else has better luck !
has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !
this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cdr / cdrw / dvdr / dvdrw , and of course plays dvd movies from uk. i love the aiff , progressive scan feature .
if it had the same number of " ? " s then it would ask if you want to overwrite another song that just had the same number of " ? " s. . .
the price is way below an ipod of the same size .
basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 .
i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones .
assuming you have filled in all the id3 tags on your mp3s , you will not have any problem finding them on your zen xtra .
first there 's the unit itself .
1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .
i like the size and weight of this little critter .
they authorized my late return , and hopefully they are giving apex heck .
i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer , and then transfer them to a friend 's .
- since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera .
i would replace them with some better sounding and more comfortable phones .
2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive , so better organization is required .
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .
negative points :
well that is not true .
obviously there is no composite video output and different analog audio signals at progressive scan mode .
you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly .
my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of .
we are overall pleased with product .
great design and looks cool .
the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .
the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .
i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem .
- outstanding signal reception
and so i must ask , what are cameras for ?
seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ).
one thing that i found out recently is that you do n't need t-zones from tmobile to go online .
so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one .
think you need to pay a fortune for a good qulaity dvd player ?
( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . )
despite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic , i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually .
2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .
the ipod is a one way only machine - from computer to player .
grandma in church quiet .
i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n't work !
i 'm live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators .
even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio .
the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) .
ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier .
overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .
so i had to give up and return it , having lost about 4 hours .
manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
i should have looked at it harder .
if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300 , i would order another just like it .
that 's my only real complaint about the nomad zen xtra , though .
yes it is 56k speed , but the functionality is what you are paying for .
i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures .
settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .
i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it .
then again a one time use camera may do just as well .
it 's just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments .
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll .
i spent much time debating on whether i should go with the zen xtra or the ipod .
i just bought this player today and i already love it .
i discovered this weekend that itunes does not sell mp3 's in the mp3 format .
this is my first digital camera .
also , the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with .
i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well .
the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you .
the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical
zen good points :
( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . )
the mediasource itself was flaky ... crashing my explorer twice within the first hour ( the crash did n't require a reboot ) ... but after another reboot , it has n't crashed since .
the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .
i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review .
my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .
now i know why - they are pieces of junk .
started ripping and transferring .
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper .
they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon 's .
creative software stinks .
this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out !
i do hope that they offer more faceplate options .
you are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player .
short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .
would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .
it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs .
it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve .
consider it for a future gift too !
- very long-lasting battery life
only used for 3 month before it 's down !
a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins , accesses files or does antyhing .
i eventually gave up with customer support and worked on fixing the problem myself .
it 's bigger , but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it 's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods .
however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off .
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .
i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes !
in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .
what more could you ask for .
i purchased this unit 3 months back and i think the unit knew when my warrenty expires .
i am extremely satisfied with this camera .
- light , compact design
you can 't find the mpeg playback on high priced units .
just get some new headphones and your set .
3 . that 's pretty much all the negatives the positive things truly outnumber the negatives , and the negatives are n't that bad .
i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used .
but for now this will do .
but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive
though we were past the deadline for returns ( by a few days ) , i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help .
well that was not a simple task .
i hoping they will then begin building quality dvd players again , as i do like them .
i am back to using # 1 .
i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it .
i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone .
simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use .
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files .
then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .
i am bored with the silver look .
granted this is cheaper than an ipod .
this is the best phone i have seen .
the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use .
but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw :
well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) .
at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast !
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .
i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures .
great camera .
zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .
it plays all my back-ups , + or - , and everything else i have put in it without a hick up .
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .
made the camera totally inoperable .
my last mp3 player 's screen drove me nuts .
i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient .
i like the automatic key lock function .
overall , i highly recommend this phone .
i checked with nokia .
also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .
on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !
actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated .
retraction : said mine had silver plate : it does have display .
i agree with the positive reviews .
it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !
for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital .
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox , it dumps all of them into a single folder , and then sorts them by the id3 tags.
amazon , do your customers a big favor , do n't carry this item , and give them refunds !
it 's been so long since i 've had a program not shut down on me in windows that i hardly even noticed that it happened .
i did n't had any problem till now .
after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .
but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes .
i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .
i was , however .
zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .
this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records .
the canon g3 .
for the money apex machines have good features .
i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .
this is one of those items that , at first glance , looked cool but did n't really ring a bell with me .
features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names .
the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .
the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .
i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
it was impossible to do so before .
great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective .
the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better .
this product is too fragile for normal use .
and then it breaks .
4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .
after os froze twice on me in the subway i returned the jukebox .
else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately " fine **" picture quality " image size : 1600 .
i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .
the dvd player is fine .
what kind of a company does that !
no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad .
another point of note : the battery life is incredible !
controls are a bit awkward .
hope i helped !
unfortunatly it was dropped and damaged a year after i bought it .
do n't drop this unit :
the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk .
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .
if you have the appetite choose the one that you think has the least deficiencies or is best suited to you .
this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
i give it 10 stars !
while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd .
easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this
i do n't really like bounce .
i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .
or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe .
this is almost it but not quite but the price was right .
the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .
yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .
. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that .
i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ?
is eax faulty ?
recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .
it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something .
i think the reson for the creative being larger is for sound dampening and protection , whihc is a plus , but then again it is only speculation .
just point and shoot and the photos were great .
i listened to it for several days before needing to recharge them .
i highly recommend this phone to anyone .
nothing but hassle with this company .
just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date .
in my case , the bill was $ 81 , about a third of what i paid for it .
after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews .
i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .
i 'd like to see how well a small company supports its mp3 player in 2 years when its battery dies as all rechargeable do .
rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet .
i returned it once , then i sent it back , and it is crap .
two months ago , an internal part failed ( not due to customer abuse ; it just failed ) .
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .
2 . i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was n't comfortable with that .
weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] .
i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there .
i use my own mid-priced headphones rather than the enclosed earbuds .
some amazon reviewers say it corrrupted their music files ;
the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you .
i should n't have been cheap , should have bought a toshiba .
i have n't figured it out yet .
none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers - you cannot make changes on the ipod that are premanent .
i do n't write many reviews but i 'm compelled to do so with this camera .
it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine .
i am averaging 4.5 mb per song , to give you an idea of how many songs you can get by the amount of memory .
this thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time .
the dynamic playlists ( " now playing " , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. .
i bought the nomad when i went home on leave and it worked great for about a month .
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it .
people complain about the scroll wheel , but its not a big deal at all ( though it is just a little annoying at times ) .
overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .
you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do .
final verdict :
to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .
the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .
unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved .
that player is a complete piece of sh ***.
i think for about $ 40 more , you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though .
if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .
the player itself has all sorts of problems .
the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod .
i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .
4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .
it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .
i have had this player for 2 weeks , i will be returning it for an exchange in the hopes that the locking problem and scroll wheel are problems with this particular unit .
it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files .
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it .
what the heck is up with the 2600 .
while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones .
forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds.
* scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models .
granted it is a little more than the zen , it is well worth it .
if you 're intrested in buying a spare battery it 'll run you another $ 50 , a little steep i thought .
apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r/rw and another supports - r/rw ) .
the i/p button switches the tv display between interlace and progressive .
right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras .
the grain was terrible .
this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .
3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .
noiseless , light weight and oh yeah .
i will never purchase anything from this company ever again and have logged my complaint with the bbb .
i know the saying is " you get what you pay for " but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse .
if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .
it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video .
you 're talking totally different hardware .
if you purchase this product , definitely rip your songs through windows media player .
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .
the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .
i 'm editing my review , because now i wish i read the manual before returning the player i bought for my girlfriend .
i tried to play the song three times , with no success .
point the " media sniffer " to your music files and let it do the rest .
i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work !
the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle .
i purchased the phone last week and have been using till then . .
this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .
i have n't used any of them since i got the g3 .
it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .
i bought myself an rca mp3-cd player , and i 'm happy with that until a cheap , worthwhile mp3 player coomes out .
if you do n't have a gray card , you can use a plain white piece of paper .
what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses .
i 'll probably also get the wide-angle now , too .
well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .
it took them twice as long to get to my unit as they said .
maybe it 's good for tvs with not so good color settings , but not good for my tv that already has very vibrant pictures .
disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone .
the first one would n't work from the start .
however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy .
big mistake .
how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu ?
" enjoy " !
as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .
when i turned eax back on the static was also not present .
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .
below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends :
the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only .
the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel .
the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .
the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist , track name and album name .
i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .
anyone looking for more than " point and shoot " can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .
creative tech support operators work 9-6 p.m. weekdays - as if i had time during work hours to spend time on this .
i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines .
the dvd played without flaw through the chapter in question .
ipod can be used as an external disk , and apparently stores files without problem .
the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .
friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it .
it do n't get any better then the nikon 4300 .
it took several days of attempts before things finally " worked " again and i have n't a clue why .
also , very light and portable .
i would have given a 3 to 5 star review in my first few weeks , depending on how mad i felt about the crummy software .
i had hoped this was bought from walmart so that i could return it !
- best in class sound
structurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you .
the higher the number the better the quality ( less data compression is used ) and the larger the file size .
i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it .
there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !
i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box .
the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact .
if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed , i would rate this a 5 star machine .
i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .
i figured with a great first product and with this one having more features than the 600 i would buy one .
the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .
at my heaviest usage , i must recharge after 3 days .
i refused to go for an ipod , i am not going to spend all that money just for the apple name and because it is " trendy " to have that player .
the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .
i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .
also , the instruction manual is very bad .
the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more .
i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service .
being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 .
nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .
100 % perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos .
the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .
the zen has no stop button .
the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .
i am very pleased with its quality and durability .
amazon has been working with me to refund my money , but they reminded me that i have past the 30 day return policy and this was a courtesy return .
this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 's large mobile screen helps with this .
it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !
i simply love this feature .
like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels .
pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent .
rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .
i use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday .
i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .
anything this phone does , it does perfectly .
do n't buy this player .
the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .
so i do n't understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them .
ok , everybody loves the fm radio in this , but you want a cell phone first , right ?
for an early christmas gift , i got a zen xtra 40 gb player .
possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .
that 's why you have these things that can be keychain size .
i recently bought the nomad jukebox zen xtra , and did n't even get as far as charging the battery .
i am using musicmatch to rip & catalog ( and if i choose , download ) music ;
- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it .
have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital.com ) , but the e-mail address is not valid .
after much research i decided on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .
the software sucks .
the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .
i have not used the progressive scan feature .
i am very pleased so far .
always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !
i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .
this means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it , and get used to having it .
perhaps there is a way around this delay .
they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy .
some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .
if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time , you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country .
do n't buy this player .
my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .
there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful .
if you can live without an integrated camera , you wo n't miss much more .
so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out .
focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get " stuck " rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .
i originally purchase a 30 gb nomad zen xtra as a portable mp3 player .
veteran zen users have explained how to stop if that 's what you want .
use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) .
well worth the money .
however , i should have followed my instincts :
some movies it played yesterday , it wo n't play today .
it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .
oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^
for most people , they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection .
while i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so ( from the purchase date ) to obtain one .
this thing is trash .
from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles .
the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !
is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel .
although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .
b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display
but , i would definately recommend this phone .
the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .
