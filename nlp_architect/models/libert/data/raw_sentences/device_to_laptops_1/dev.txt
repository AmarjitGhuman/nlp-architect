It is extremely fast and very compact .
I am very happy with this laptop .
The processor went on me , the fan went and the motherboard went .
The AC power port becomes loose over time
I went with him and we picked this one .
Despite the inconvenient weight , I opted for the 12 cell battery .
I practically have a new laptop with all the " fixes " they have done !
I purchased two laptops ( for my husband and 16 year old daughter ) .
I love the keyboard .
The device speaks about it self .
Pairing it with an iPhone is a pure pleasure - talk about painless syncing - used to take me forever - now it 's a snap .
The ease in which you set everything up is such that a child could do it .
And the warranty on this macbook pro can last up to 5 years or 1000 battery recharge cycles .
That 's right , no power , absolutely NOTHING .
We do n't Mind and You do n't Matter .
The repairs were made quickly though I must say , however the second time they shipped it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me .
It runs very quiet too which is a plus .
You can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy o boy does it ever .
I charge it at night and skip taking the cord with me because of the good battery life .
The price was very good , and the product is top quality .
I 'll rather be out of date then spend more money on toshiba .
This computer is absolutely AMAZING !!!
Later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months .
I ' have had it for about a 1 1/2 and yes I have had an issue with it one month out of warranty .
The computer would not ever cut back on .
The first one sent : Touchpad did n't work The second sent : USB did n't work The third sent : Touchpad did n't work The fourth sent : Has n't arrived yet .
Almost 4 years ago I bought what was then the current , up to date HP Pavilion -- If I recall correctly , it was the dv 1300 t.
I really like the Mac 15.4 in . Notebook , but its very pricey .
I would recommend to any one lloking for a first class computer !
You have to toss out the wifi card and replace it just to have any sort of network capability .
The computer first started malfunctioning 3 months after purchasing it .
It was so exciting for me to unwrapp my new mac .
After fumbling around with the OS I started searching the internet for a fix and found a number of forums on fixing the issue .
My wireless system would not recognize Windows 7 and I could n't get online to find out why .
This laptop looks great on the surface : 17 " inch screen , good price-point , nice appearance , boots up quickly , runs fast etc .
Oh , it is such a great piece of equipment .
It takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site , then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works .
Bought this gateway M-50 or 150 early 2007 .
it has 3 usb ports , 1 sd memory card reader and an sd memory car expansion .
Small and light weight .
Thanks for the fast shipment and great price .
I love windows 7 but i ca n't give Toshiba any credit for that , unless y' all get serious about ergonomics and making required connections less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time .
Accordingly , I have decided to NEVER purchase another HP product ( my five year old Compaq ) lasted 5-years before the hard drive crashed .
All the customers that come in hate Dell .
the mcbook pro notebook will make it easy for you to write and read your emails at blazing speeds .
Excellent LED monitor and well equipped .
Only issue is that it is a little slow , and I 'm fixing that by adding more RAM .
I 'm pleased .
Chatting with Acer support , I was advised the problem was corrupted operating system files .
After replacing the spinning hard disk with an ssd drive , my mac is just flying .
The Dell mini was the first Dell product that I had ever purchased .
This is great if you have several lectures back to back and do n't have a chance to charge during one of the lectures .
These new problems were the final straws ;
Let me start off by saying that I was highly reluctant to spend so much money on a laptop .
Very nice unibody construction .
I am definitely sold , and not going back to PCs for home use !
Summary : After doing some investigation on the web , I have found that Toshiba NB205s are not chronically not booting .
it 's just a great toy to have around .
It was getting old and I needed a new school computer .
Web browsing is very quick with Safari browser .
After all was said and done , I essentially used that $ 450 savings to buy 16GB of RAM , TWO Seagate Momentus XT hybrid drives and an OWC upgrade kit to install the second hard drive .
I normally dont participate in reviews/surveys but this laptop has not given me any problems and hope to share my thoughts ...
What a mistake !
Taking it anywhere was a pain !
I love it !
I upgraded it 's RAM to 2GB , I am very happy with it .
But if you 're willing to pay another 200 dollar for a windows disc .
Overall , I experienced a huge change in that my mac runs pretty fast compared to my old PC .
But the biggest pain is that tech support is not available 24/7 .
I have n't tried the one with retina display ... Maybe in the future .
It 's so much easier to navigate through the operating system , to find files , and it runs a lot faster !
This time the mouse pad and right click key would n't work !
After much battling with HP i was able to return it 4 times for repairs .
As a computer science student in college , I find that the portability , longevity , and ease of use of this computer make me ( shockingly ) want to do homework more ;
Going to bring it to service today .
The notebook would not turn back on again .
Plus two finger clicking as a replacement for the right click button is surprisingly intuitive .
I was always against them but now I buying one I 'll never go back to PC .
But we had paid for bluetooth , and there was none .
So far , so good !
This laptop is a 100 times better than a Chromebook !
The battery life is also relatively good .
The lcd screen stopped working on mine after 10 months .
I homeschool my kids and with this netbook next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat .
they respond : " your dissatisfaction is noted " ...
Yes , he is a self professed " Mac snob .
It certainly does , but you rarely hear any of your friends with Mac 's complain about anything .
OS X is solid with lots of innovations such as quicklook which save heaps of time .
Acer was no help and Garmin could not determine the problem ( after spending about 2 hours with me ) , so I returned it and purchased a Toshiba R700 that seems even nicer and I was able to load all of my software with no problem .
With no problems , I 'm happy with this purchase because I saved money compared to buying it anywhere else .
Enjoy your sitdown
Very dissappointed becase I have had toshibas for years , and never a issue .
So you might ask , what did Apple do for me ?
But the mountain lion is just too slow .
The body is a bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up .
Of course , I inspected the other netbooks and clearly their hinges are tighter and I even demonstrate the difference between my netbook and others .
Thank you .
Windows Vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service .
The store honored their warrenty and made the comment that they do n't even recommend the HP brand because of the problems with their warrentys .
I am first time Mac Buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the Mac offers .
Easy to customize setting and even create your own bookmarks .
If you are looking for a netbook pc DO NOT BUY FROM ASUS !!!
:) In the past four years I 've had it I have never once gotten a virus .
I do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it , however I would highly suggest purchasing a stand however , due to the nature of the design of the macbook as it is one very large heat sink .
Toshiba knows there is a manufacturing defect but will not acknowledge it .
So this review might be a tad bit bias .
it has had some problems .
It took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back .
If I have a few hundred dollars to spare , I 'd buy the Pro line though , the 2.53 and 2.66 GHz model .
It was kind of a rebellion against PC in fact , and I am certainly glad I did .
Within 3 weeks the same issues started happening AGAIN .
It works fine with our wireless and they 've had not problems .
Overall , this is a wonderful computer and definitly worth the purchase !
I WILL NEVER AGAIN buy another Acer , not will I buy Gateway , or eMachine as they are all from the same company .
Programs would crash all the time , and it turned out to be a very unstable , unreliable laptop for me .
But , at the same time they ( the company ) would not and could not do anything about my problem .
Never been hacked .
Maybe it 's Acer , maybe it 's MSFT .
Every time I log into the system after a few hours , there is this endlessly frustrating process that I have to go through .
Yet my mac continues to function properly .
One more tip , please purchase this model and get a 4GB stick of RAM to save you $ 10
Also , you wo n't have to worry about them going onlne a getting a virus .
Needs longer lasting battery , More than 1 to 2 Hrs .
Who knows what will happen later on when they dismantle the whole damn thing ? So , I said I wanted a new set .
It 's applications are terrific , including the replacements for Microsoft office .
Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac .
Great laptop for school , easy to use for beginners in the household .
I like the operating system .
I got what I paid for .
This purchase opened me to the world of Macbooks , and I am impressed with the intuition of the design , the beauty of the product , and the excellent technological advances associated with it .
I 've owned this labtop for less then two months , already the mouse button has broke .
The first one I had was a 2006 model , not the Pro .
( No problem with the ordering or shipping by the way .
I have been PC for years but this computer is intuitive and its built in features are a great help
The difference is phenomenal .
But after using it a couple of weeks , the overall operation is poor .
Very light and easily maneuverable .
This is why I purchased a BRAND NEW LAPTOP in the first place so it would n't have ANY problems .
IT WANT TAKE IT , IT KEEP SAYING ERROR .
do a quick search on the internet see if im the only one .
It is not ideal for children because of the temp .
Ok , this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by Apple .
You can even run a parallels type program easily and run any leftover PC software that you absolutely can not be without .
This causes my wrist to scrape up against it .
But the Macbook is the best !
I ' ts nice to have the higher-end laptops , but this fits my budget and the features I need .
I use a cooling pad but it does n't help .
About 2 months ago i bought the 2011 macbook pro , which was an upgrade from my 2010 macbook pro .
Also , my sister got the exact same laptop ( since they were so cheap ) and after 8 months , the screen split in half just from everyday use .
I purchased an HP right after my high school graduation .
it is an amazing image and it too is holding up quite nicely to little hands grabbing the back of my laptop .
Overall it 's an amazing product , 5 stars !
It is so great , I can Hardly ever take my hands off it !
I Have been a Pc user for a very long time now but I will get used to this new OS .
Page just disapeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something .
The SuperDrive is quiet .
When it come time for warranty service to Toshiba you do n't matter .
However , this will be my last as well .
The Macbook starts fast , does n't crash , has a fantastic display , is small and light ( I have the 13.3 " model ) , and is n't always complaining about updates , lost connections , errors , blue screens , etc .
I was not aware that this product can not display websites that contain Flash .
my information was all lost ( my fault , I know , but I never thought I would need to back up my information on a brand new Mac , the paragon of all computers !
BAck she goes !
I can not even imaging going back to a PC after using this wonderful computer .
I saved for this laptop for 3 months and I can tell you personally it was worth the wait .
The advantages of owning ' a ' mac are numerous .
All the above aside this machine ROCKS !
Cons : Screen resolution .
Only a few days after I received the computer back , the screen froze again .
This laptop does everything I need it to very well .
I ca n't say enough of how satisfied I am with their product and help aftermarket .
There is nothing better .
I bought it during the recent Comex IT show .
The best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once , it never slows down .
And if you are a game player it works with World Of Warcraft wonderfully .
4 ) Laptop still did not work , blue screen within a week ...
This is my second MacBook .
The Toshiba Mini Notebook , Model NB 305-N410BL , is a great little computer .
Also , because of the size and consistancy of the laptop computer , some websites would n't even attempt to work on the computer because of browser problems .
Oh my goodness-I am not a happy camper .
The layout of the MacBook is horrible and confusing ;
Am very glad I bought it , great netbook , low price .
It 's also very capable of doing moderate video editing ( although you may need the performance boost of the larger MacBook Pros for heavy duty mobile video editing ) .
They say that this will invalidate the warranty on the hard drive ( I do n't really understand why but anyway ) .
I simply got tired of a bad computer like windows with its constant freezing and anti-virus .
I could save ten essay papers and have hardly any memory left .
Acer has set me up with FREE recovery discs , when they are available since I asked .
My favorite by far , although the most expensive , was my Sony .
Not easy to carry .
I was sorly disapointed to discover that HP ( what I thought was a reputable company ) would n't honor the warrenty when the fan blade fell apart .
My wife was so excited to open the box , but quickly came to see that it did not function as it should .
The system it comes with does not work properly , so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all .
It lasted for many years of travel , kids and abuse and if I fired it up today , it would work .
And at one point , they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when I upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop ( I bought the memory stick they recomended ) .
Also the display is exceptional !
I even got my teenage son one , because of the features that it offers , like , iChat , Photobooth , garage band and more !
To those thinking about switching , do it and do not look back !
The OS is great .
u can do what u want in just few seconds , even to start up your computer takes few seconds .
I highly recommend this computer for students looking for a solid machine to get them through college .
The computer runs very fast with no problems and the iLife software that comes with it ( iPhoto , iMovie , iWeb , iTunes , GarageBand ) is all very helpful as well .
I will only buy apple laptops from now on .
The macbook pro is really responsive .
Easy to start up and does not overheat as much as other laptops .
Searched it on amazon and on bestbuy .
This is what I call a good after sales service .
HP refused to give me a new one and Wal Mart refused to take it back .
I really wanted a Mac over a pc because I used a Mac in high school .
Let me start with the good : So awesome .
I just recently had to ship my laptop back to HP for repair .
My MacBook Pro has been a huge disappointment .
I was told that it seems to be a multi - component failure .
There are no gold key numbers too intall programs , you must use the serial numbers that it does not accept and then things are limited as far a working because they are only good for a short time .
Very very disappointed !
I think this computer is super lame .
There is no cd drive on the computer , which defeats the purpose of keeping files on a cd .
I decided I wanted a laptop so I went into the BBY store .
Mac computers automatically " defrag " each time you start your computer .
I have owned it only two months !
I can actually get work done with this MAC , and not fight with it like my tired old PC laptop .
I love everything about it .
I play a lot of casual games online , and the touchpad is very responsive .
I sit down and use my husband 's work PC and I do n't like it one bit .
Me and my boyfriend bought the Gateway NV78 in nov of 09 .
The apple systems are over priced luxurys that ar n't worth what they are being charged for , this model 's specifications are far from being impressive and they only thing you get out of this is the apple name .
I had to wait 3 weeks to get it back and it still is not working properly .
I run windows via bootcamp for the couple programs I do not want to buy a mac version of , like my cad programs .
Great product by Apple with the new great looking design .
Hopefully Amazon will take this back .
The Genius at the Apple store advised me that there was nothing about my use of the computer that caused this failure .
It was important that it was powerful enough to do all of the tasks he needed on the internet , word processing , graphic design and gaming .
Second HDD cover has walls inside that need to be broken if you what to install one .
This mac does come with an extender cable and I 'm using mine right now hoping the cable will stay nice for the many years I plan on using this mac .
Do n't get me wrong , I am no Microsoft hater , I 've just managed to turn into a much bigger Apple fan because of this machine .
When I finally had everything running with all my software installed I plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed .
But I do n't see it as a problem .
My review mainly talks about the difference I have felt between an early 2011 and late 2011 mac book pro .
Plain and simple , it ( laptop ) runs great and loads fast .
Has met or exceeded my needs for a compact travel device .
And if you do a lot of writing , editing is a problem since there is no forward delete key .
Whenever tried to turn it on , it would restart as soon as the BIOS launched Windows ( or Winblows , as I like ot call it ) .
It is very fast and has everything that I need except for a word program .
I spoke with a service rep at Micro Center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her power adapter , so it 's not just an isolated incident !!!
I think this will happen to any new version of computer/phone released and I need to wait for the next set of updates to have all of this fixed .
overall i would recomend this to anybody and tell them that if they want to burn their music or play there video games to buy the cd drive .
For the price and what I get out of it has exceeded my expectations .
I bought this laptop about a month ago to replace my compaq laptop .
It even has a great webcam , and Skype works very well .
I would not recommend this to anyone wanting a notebook expecting the performance of a Desktop it does not meet the expectations .
I love how easy every thing is to do on my Apple products .
I my wife is also now the proud owner of a Macbook as well !
Runs like a champ .....
High price tag , however .
I 'm the pro-active type so I went off and did some preventative fixes .
Just bit the bullet and bought the Mac hoping it will last a lot longer … .
It started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it was plugged in ( mousing over the battery icon would read , for example , " 74 % , plugged in , not charging " ) , requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge .
And I may be the only one but I am really liking Windows 8 .
The battery life was supposed to be 6 hours , but even if I ran off the battery with the high effeciency setting the battery would only last me on average about 2.5 to 3 hours .
You will not regret buying such a great thing like this !
After 3 pleasant weeks of use , the laptop just died .
I bought this laptop because of the performance to price ratio .
The mousepad is a huge pain in the arse !
This is the first time for me to use a Mac and I 'm really happy with the move .
I work with kids and they love making short videos on there .
I would recommend this computer to anyone searching for the perfect laptop , and the battery life is amazing .
The product is prefect for everyone .
However , I can refute that OSX is " FAST " .
Deal of the year .
I use it now more than I even thought I would .
It was over rated !
They 're absolutely useless , unless you count the joy of releasing anger while smashing into little peices against the wall .
I 've had to call Apple support to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful , english speaking ( from Vancouver ) techs that walked me through the processes to help me .
Though the picture , video , and music software is nowhere close to professional grade software Im used to ( CS5 ) but does the job for beginner and even intermediate media designers .
It was old but it was not till we bought the Dell did we realize how great it was .
I 'm hoping the rest of the features will be the signature quality of apple .
i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have .
And the ram ( the thing that makes it faster ) comes sporting 2 gigs for high performance to handle more stuff at once and surf the web a whole lot faster than before .
It is a great size and amazing windows 8 included !
Then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running .
The Macbook is a fantastic laptop .
The people there just changed for me on the spot and I got a new arm piece and they did n't even request for a receipt .
I was tired of going without my laptop every few weeks .
The ATI graphics card is a huge plus , definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a Intel built-in card would have trouble with , such as Half-Life 2 or even World of Warcraft .
I bought this last week , and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the touch-mouse stopped responding .
Only problem that I had was that the track pad was not very good for me , I only had a problem once or twice with it , But probably my computer was a bit defective .
I absolutely love my mac !
I had my computer custom built from Sonystyle.com .
It is stamped and not in pieces therefore it is a stronger more resilient frame .
He gave me this PC about 3 years ago and up to this point im still sitting here using it .
I was so excited to get this in the mail i nearly gave myself a heart attack .
i had to return it for a replacement .
This is another reason to like the Mac .
Easy to carry , can be taken anywhere , can be hooked up to printers , headsets .
I especially like the backlit keyboard .
Great deal on an amazing lap top !
I have recommended this laptop to everyone I know who is buying one .
Finally set the unit back to HP after a month of hell .
BOUGHT FROM WAL-MART , I BELIEVE THAT THIS LAPTOP WAS A REPAIRED ITEM .
At first , the computer seemed a great deal -- seemingly high-end specs for a low , low price .
The internet capabilities are also very strong and picks up signals very easily .
Purchased a Toshiba Lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out .
I love this laptop , and use it everyday to do something , and never lets me down .
I love this product because it is Toshiba and its 15.6 " .
It is super easy to use .
Sure it has the one touch keys but that was the best feature of the computer .
if yo like practicality this is the laptop for you .
Later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months .
Got the computer back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it .
It has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard !
Hmmm - that high failure rate sure is n't reflected in the retail price .
It was slow , locked up , and also had hardware replaced after only 2 months !
You will not regret buying this computer !
I called back to ensure that received it , they had .
I LOVE IT !
WILL NOT EVERY BUY ANOTHER -------- LOU
lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small .
Also , I issued a replacement RMA for a few dead pixels in the upper zone of the screen , which is noticable to me .
/ awesome cooling system / much better grafics card ( ATI 5870 ) / 8GB RAM / LED backlit screen ...
It came in brand new and works perfectly .
One night I turned the freaking thing off after using it , the next day I turn it on , no GUI , screen all dark , power light steady , hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does .
I would rate this computer at 5 stars , but considering it has a short life span I can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine .
Apparently there is a manufacturing defect , something with the amount of thermal paste .
Battery is lasting about 6 hours as I am surfing the web on Sundays while checking football scores and watching funny Youtube videos .
Mac also has many apps and programs that are quite cheap or free .
It bluescreened on me without any warning , running simply basic Chrome .
I bought this netbook for traveling , and it 's great - light , functional , and meets my needs .
I was constantly having to roll back the computer after doing updates .
the i3 processor does n't seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on .
i will be returning it and switching brands when i get to best buy .
Best Buy Rocks !
I still have that stupid bluetooth mouse to !
My laptop is so light that I can take it with me anywhere .
Loaded with bloatware .
Also , I have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly .
On two occasions the computer s calendar told me it was 1969 .
without a big ol' clunky machine in my backpack , I feel like I can do programming homework anywhere .
Sad very SAD .
This machine is A-mazing .
I picked it out because it was inexpensive ( $ 400 ) and I thought it would be a good , easy to use first laptop .
Its ease of use and the top service from Apple - be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar - can not be beat .
Each time taking about 1 day or so .
If you want a little more custom ability , drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of Win 7 and grab a 2GB stick of memory to spice it all up a bit more .
Now for the hardware problems .
Although I opted for the lowest end MacBook Pro , this thing holds its own .
It has a .1 ghz faster processor and a stock 500gb hard drive .
- Called MacHouse Amsterdam to ask for a temporary replacement , no answer .
Could n't keep a page up you were working on !
Looks nice , but has a horribly cheap feel .
The keyboard is like no other laptop keyboard .
The price and features more than met my needs .
Other than not being a fan of click pads ( industry standard these days ) and the lousy internal speakers , it 's hard for me to find things about this notebook I do n't like , especially considering the $ 350 price tag .
Also , I have had alot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines .
It pretty much does everything we could ever need , and looks great to boot .
The extended warranty for the $ 4000 and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu .
I go to purchase it on line , and I find out that the device will not be available until almost two months later !
A MONTH LATER , we reinstall the OS ( Vista ) .
Which is great I am running Vista Business and scored a 5.X on the index I have never seen a windows machine have a total score in the 5 's .
He came into my house , fiddled around on the computer for a good forty minutes and got ready to leave before it was even done doing what he was doing to it .
- Apple offers to send replacement and after 10 days I send them the old computer .
So you out of of notebook and money .
I believe this is because I was more active than the average user , meaning I average about three " tabs " .
Its only crashed on me one time in the 3 months i 've had it .
Actually , I had noticed the one on the sales floor also did n't have sound !
Also kinda loud when the fan was running .
Super light , super sexy and everything just works .
As with any laptop not purchased with software options , it comes with a lot of what I consider useless applications .
Hopefully my replacement is brand new .
Well , maybe more like week one .
I thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer would n't go onto our wireless network and I would n't have the same problems because it was updated .
I would recommend this product .
This thing sucks !
but other then that I would give this product a 4 in hafe stars .
The Mac version of Microsoft Office is cheaper than buying the actual and works just as well .
THIS is what a laptop is supposed to be .
Do yourself a favor , this is not a fake story trying to hurt alienware ...
The difference is the Toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space .
I have had the netbook for 2 months and I love it , I read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other computers I use .
I find it not to be very user friendly .
My children wo n't even use it for their school work .
Customization on mac is impossible .
Harddrive was in poor condition , had to replace it .
I have used PC 's and converting to this MacBook Pro was easy .
Consumer Report recommended Toshiba .
If you 're not wanting to be mobile , this is a good laptop to sit on a desk .
Besides , the apple stocks have been falling due to lack of sales .
There is no HDMI receptacle , nor is there an SD card slot located anywhere on the device .
Now the machine wo n't connect and Toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in May but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now I 'm out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since I bought the netbook .
I went to Toshiba online help and found some suggestions to fix it .
It discharges too quickly .
Not sure on Windows 8 .
My main reason to convert was the imovie program .
It has been nothing but trouble from the time we bought it .
Maybe this is virus related , maybe not , but the computer has locked up many times , and on two occasions , the screen has simply gone black .
If you get a lemon ( I have two thirds of my Macs ) , you have to send it in for repairs several times before they will replace it , even if they have numerous problems with the same version of their computers .
I had left my regular laptop at home and needed something to use while out of town .
After numerous attempts of trying ( including setting the clock in BIOS setup directly ) , I gave up ( I am a techie ) .
Quality Display I was surprised with the performance and quality of this HP Laptop .
It 's a great product for a great price !
And that probably explains why I 've already had my SATA controller go bad within a year of buying it .
I wanted a computer that was quite , fast , and that had overall great performance .
This netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop ( my wife and I have another laptop ) , or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks .
Do not buy it !
the manufacturer 's warranty only covers replacement/repair of parts .
The perfect notebook ...
If only Bill Gates would read some of what is said here MS would do a better job .
If you do n't feel comfortable doing it yourself , just buy the case and be happy , plus it looks nice , I bought the white one from Best Buy .
I am sorry that I purchased this laptop .
i would have to say that overall its great !
Reason why ? It 's because when you buy it , you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that laptop , the price will stay the same for the next year , and even if Apple does decides to change mode , your laptop value will only drop 10-20 % , unlike PC laptops which drop more than 80 % .
Sure , the initial out of pocket expense is greater , but that should not dissuade anyone from the fact that these machines run like none other on the planet , and when I factor in all the money in that I wasted on Geek Squad and the latest patches to de-corrupt my infested PCs , it probably comes out about even anyhow .
But I am glad to have gotten mine right before they stopped making it .
I have had a black macbook since 2007 .
Registration/1st use is easy .
Everything about the Mac is not only visually appealing , but very easy to use .
So , the hard disk capacity really does n't matter to me .
Most everything is fine with this machine : speed , capacity , build .
Disappointing for such a lovely screen and at a reasonable price
Seems to me that 's the best way to get Apple 's attention .
My last laptop was a 17 " ASUS gaming machine , which performed admirably , but having since built my own desktop and really settling into the college life , I found myself wanting something smaller and less cumbersome , not to mention that the ASUS had been slowly developing problems ever since I bought it about 4 years ago .
But I do NOT like Win8 .
The laptop is relatively simple to use , though I bought Macs for Dummies , which is well worth $ 2
Clear picture on it and everything .
There is hardly any memory on the computer 's hard drive .
I purchased it this year when my old HP laptop finally died and I was looking for something smaller and lighter than a laptop to carry around for classes and traveling .
Highly recommended !
Easy learning curve .
The speakers could have been better but it was n't a deal breaker ... this is a great little laptop ... love it !
I tell everyone that I know , friends , family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used .
In fact , somehow ( and I never opened it up ) some specks of dust or something got inside the screen and are now there permanently , behind the front of the screen , in the way of the display .
Everything is falling apart internally and externally .
Not to mention , the battery life is absolutely amazing .
I really like the size and I 'm a fan of the ACERS .
After years of occasionally pulling my hair out fighting computer viruses , a good friend convinced me it was time to go the Apple route .
The sound is a bit quiet if you 're on a plane , this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones .
The laptop is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the Windows 7 starter and not the full Windows 7 .
I purchased my first Mac and am glad I did .
For me , keys were starting to get stuck and would n't type very well .
Sorry Toshiba , but 1st impressions do count for something .
I had this computer for one month and had to send it in for repair .
First off , I really do like my MBP ... once used to the OS it is pretty easy to get around , and the overall build is great ... eg the keyboard is one of the best to type on .
the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer , left right and front .
I 'm not going to lie , I 've never really liked the Acer brand in general .
Would do business again .
This is the first Apple product that I have purchased .
It is sleek , smooth , and lightweight .
The aluminum body sure makes it stand out .
the size of has actually help me out quite a bit by me being able to fit it in an already full backpack and to use it at a resturant where the food on the table is always so space consuming .
I needed something affordable from Apple and was tired of dealing with PC laptop after PC laptop .
So glad I did not waste money on a less than par product .
I opted for the SquareTrade 3-Year Computer Accidental Protection Warranty ( $ 1500-2000 ) which also support " accidents " like drops and spills that are NOT covered by AppleCare .
I would like at least a 4 hr . battery life .
My mac laptop is fabulous in both areas .
i setup my password last night with the password on my other computer .
However the frozen screens kept happening .
Made interneting ( part of my business ) very difficult to maintain .
It is by far one of the greatest investments I have ever made .
dell is a decently made pc .
It could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have DDR5 instead of DDR3 .
And not to mention after using it for a few months or so , the battery will slowly less and less hold a charge until you ca n't leave it unplugged for more than 5 minutes without the thing dying .
Awesome form factor , great battery life , wonderful UX .
However , it did not have any scratches , ZERO battery cycle count ( pretty surprised ) , and all the hardware seemed to be working perfectly .
I think it was around 16 hundred bucks last I checked .
However , a NETBOOK will be a different story .
It took so much time .
Memory is upgradable .
I would like to tell you about the best laptop I just got from Mac .
I would definitely not go back to using a PC after using the mac .
When my Dell laptop gave up only after 2 1/2 years , I decided to buy MacBook Pro .
Best Buy ended up junking the computer and giving me a replacement computer .
Honestly , this is absolutely wonderful .
It is easy to go from one keyboard to another .
* IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD LAPTOP , THIS IS NOT IT !
It is , however , very heavy .
My next laptop will also be a Mac !
Dealing with the support drone on the other end of the chat was sheer torture .
When I called Toshiba , they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $ 35 for the phone call , even though they did n't offer any technical support .
i would really recommend to any person out there to get this laptop cause its really worth it .
Handles all my basic media needs easily .
I would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express .
It makes doing schoolwork at night so much easier .
Should be there by the end of the week ( again ... ) .
It was not clear that the Microsoft Student Edition that was loaded on the computer , was a six month trial .
Another thing I might add is the battery life is excellent .
I can leave my MacBook uncharged for upwards of eight hours and it wo n't even be dead .
Another THREE weeks later I had my laptop back with a new mousepad , keys , and casing .
How Toshiba handles the repair seems to vary , some folks indicate that they were charged for even an intial fix , others had the repair done 5 times .
It allows you to automatically upload photos to your Facebook account with one click .
It was a Waste of money from day one !
It doesnt get hot like my PC , with technology always at the tip of our fingertips anytime I forget how to do something i just google it .
It has enough memory and speed to run my business with all the flexibility that comes with a laptop .
But I needed a laptop for school use .
I realize that not every unit has this issue , but the ones that do can not be repaired .
Despite the plethora of problems , I managed to use technological trickery to keep the machine operational for two years .
The only thing that I do n't like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that I want to be able to run and I am not able to .
I 'm really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer .
The display is beyond horrible .
It 's been a couple weeks since the purchase and I 'm struggle with finding the correct keys ( but that was expected ) .
Spent 2 hours on phone with HP Technical Support .
I did n't like one thing about it .
It is the perfect size and speed for me .
So glad I have gone this route !!
Or the cursor would show up some place else .
Pay attention to the specs if you want these options .
I also made a recovery USB stick .
But the arm velcro is torn after one use .
Great battery , speed , display .
Well , I had completed the presentation in powerpoint the night before on my PC , but took the Apple to the conference .
Thanks , MacConnection , for making this a seamless purchase !
I have had it 9 months and it is already a $ 250 loss .
I paid for extra memory and the 17-inch screen , as well as the top of the line DVD and CD burners .
What angers me more than anything else is that I spent all those years hating MACs when I could have been getting a lot more production with a whole lot less grief !
I did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements , but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before I purchased .
I previously owned an older Dell laptop that died after about 5 or 6 years .
Other Thoughts : I love newegg , I recommend them to the world however this is just unacceptable .
Great value , fast delivery - Computer works as if brand new , no problems , very pleased
Its small enough where I can take it pretty much anywhere , but still has a big enough screen to get everything done .
Runs very smoothly .
it is very easy for anyone to use an apple and specially the mcbook pro notebook .
The only thing I wish is the 15 inch MacBook Pro has much better speakers on the side of the keyboard .
Oh yeah , do n't forget the expensive shipping to and from HP .
They are not .
I 'm Not exagerating when I say this computer is perfect . . i It is !!
THIS HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT A HEADACHE SINCE WE PURCHASED IT .
Crisp screen , great battery life , and plenty of storage .
Was disappointed to find out that the model had been discontinued , apparently because of known motherboard problems .
This mac is great !
See when it comes to laptops you buy it and get just a normal operating system with trials of must need stuff that should come with it .
The display on this computer is the best I 've seen in a very long time , the battery life is very long and very convienent .
Support has been lackluster and now I just want a refund .
Unless you need the Bluetooth 3 .
The best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features .
Now I could get myself a cheap computer , that will probably work a whole lot better !
The Macbook Pro is extremely thin and light compared to those heavy Windows Laptop .
Stay away from Envy .
It is absolutely horrible to use , despite all its so called advanced features .
No Cd Rom in the new version there 's no way I 'm spending that kind of money on something has less features than the older version .
Garageband is more for the musicians , and the laptop is equipped with a good working microphone , good enough for beginners and musicians at the intermediate level .
Well I spilled something on it and they replaced it with this model , which gets hot and the battery does n't make it through 1 DVD .
I came from the Dell Laptops and now I am so glad I switched when I needed a new laptop .
The unibody construction really does feel lot more solid than Apple 's previous laptops .
Because we did not purchase the extended warranty in time , we are on the hook for the repair .
I could n't be more pleased .
It has many great programs , such as ILife , iPhotos and others .
Then 2 of my nephews were going into music and both fell in love with the MacBook Pro .
What can I say .
Simple details , crafted aluminium and real glass make this laptop blow away the other plastic ridden , bulky sticker filled laptops .
Perfect for all my graphic design classes I 'm taking this year in college : - )
There are reviews that speak to a few possible glitches but , I have n't seen them yet .
Microsoft word was not on it andI had to buy it seperately .
Adjust the sensitivity since it 's not that responsive to begin with .
Graphics are clean and sharp , internet interfaces are seamless .
I can do everything I could before , only faster and more efficiently .
I really wish I had done this years ago .
I ca n't honestly say I was heartbroken .
I can say that I am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied .
I switched to this because I wanted something different , even though I miss windows .
Cheaper than buying it @ apple too !
Just beware no DVD slot so when I went to install software I had on CD I could n't .
You just get a trial version either way .
Just a month and a half or two months ago , my VAIO crashed again .
I like it !
She brought out 2 other identical netbooks and still insist that " It is like that one " .
The configuration is perfect for my needs .
The port is secured to motherboard so when this happens you ca n't see the plug at all , it 's just gone .
Shipping was quick and product described was the product sent and so much more ...
My only gripe would be the need to add more RAM .
But , like I said before , the only reason I do n't currently have a Mac laptop is because all of their laptops are too pricey .
It started out getting hot after only a few months .
Returned laptop for a 4th repair and it came back but now would lock up and randomly reboot frequently making the laptop unusable .
My Mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary .
Hewlett Packard HP Pavillion DV6000 Laptop is the worst laptop we have ever bought .
It 's fast , quiet , incredibly small and affordable compared to other Mac models .
I did not take the class and wish that I would have .
The Mini 's body has n't changed since late 2010 - and for a good reason .
I did not have to call the support line at all .
This computer was so challenging to carry and handle .
We figure that after everything HIS pc actually ended up costing $ 350 more than my original Mac .
cosmetically , the only thing they changed was 2 of the Function keys at the top .
I will have to purchase Spy ware or Nortell for privacy protection .
I have had at least eight Toshiba laptops , and they have been outstanding , including this one .
Before I begin , I will say that I am not like a good percentage of the people that will end up writing a review on this computer - I am not an Apple fanboy .
It Was a great deal after all .
There are no viruses or spyware to worry about like on a Windows computer .
I want the portability of a tablet , without the limitations of a tablet and that 's where this laptop comes into play .
I already have a HP laptop I bought last year that 's standard size .
It was fast , and it was " different " .
This is my first LG product .
The MacBook Pro is a great product which can meet the needs of the average consumer .
This one still has the CD slot .
Oh and if thats not bad enough it does n't come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $ 25 for two cds .
I did not like my acer .
I called Toshiba where I gave them the serial number and they informed me that they were having issues with the mother boards .
Great purchase and I definitely did n't miss out on the Black Friday deals .
Did not enjoy the new Windows 8 and touchscreen functions .
The screen gets smeary and dusty very quickly and it 's very noticeable .
Good for every day computing and web browsing .
Yes , I have it on the highest available setting .
The hard drive crashed as well , and I had to buy a new power cord .
From the speed to the multi touch gestures this operating system beats Windows easily .
It 's fast , it 's easy easy easy to set up , easy to hook to my wireless network .
I 've owned every " Pro " model Apple laptop for the last 8 years , this is BY FAR the WORST one I 've ever had .
Mom , Dad , Brother , sister , You name it !
On 3 July 2004 , I purcased this model at Best Buy for about $ 150
It runs perfectly .
It 's a good fix , in my opinion .
The DVD drive randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well , which is annoying .
I got my MacBook Pro because I wanted to do all the stuff I need to do without worrying about the system quitting on me or freezing for a few minutes .
GREAT INVESTMENT !
I 'm making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the ' old ' way - and Apple does , indeed , have the better idea .
I had to call Apple 19 times ( each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone ) , and take it to their store for evaluations , and diagnostics , 5 times .
It played various games without problems and ran aero smoothly and flawlessly .
they improved nothing else such as Resolution , appearance , cooling system , graphics card , etc .
A * big * upgrade from my 13 " 2006 macbook .
Many people complain about the new OS , and it 's urgent for Apple to fix it asap !
Then the hard drive failed ;
The right speaker did not work .
I 'm definitely not hard on laptops and guarantee 100 % that no liquid has touched this machine in my presence .
Toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done .
It is better than my old acer laptop .
And , if you are going to deal with HP be careful .
It is very well built .
Never any doubt I would get a MacBook , just was n't sure which one .
In the shop , these MacBooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure - so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it , get it home , break the seal and use it ( very clever con ) .
It is much better than the Acer ultrabook I had before .
Does exactly what I bought it 4 .
Also stunning colors and speedy
What a waste .
I am able to organize my pics , music and files easily .
I swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one .
I feel that enough people have Macs these days and that companies need to start making things more compatable than they used to be .
Strong build though which really adds to its durability .
Although i do believe that Windows operating system may be to fault for some of the problems .
it is of high quality , has a killer GUI , is extremely stable , is highly expandable , is bundled with lots of very good applications , is easy to use , and is absolutely gorgeous .
It has a faster processor and more ram .
and if u did .
Steve Jobs , probably needs help and donations , and can not afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby .
My friend just had to replace his entire motherboard , so did my wife , and it looks like I will have to as well .
Still pretty pricey , but I 've been putting off money for a while as a little Macbook Fund , and finally got to use it .
I reinstalled windows through the recovery discs and everything seemed good again .
taking it back less than 24 hours of purchase
After that the said it was under warranty .
The screen is huge and coloful , but no LED backlighting .
pros : the macbook pro notebook has a large battery life and you wont have to worry to charge your laptop every five hours or so .
The investment of a new MacBook Pro came at a price , but totally worth it for a good piece of mind .
The machine itself is alright .
In fact I still use manyLegacy programs ( Appleworks , FileMaker Pro , Quicken , Photoshop etc ) !
If you check you will find the same notebook with the above missing ports and a dual core AMD or Intel processor .
Quick and has built in virus control .
I can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner .
My brother is a computer wiz and would laugh at me because he used an Apple .
The screen is n't huge , but that does n't matter when I output media to the 50 inch LCD TV .
*** The review below is no longer relevant , Apple has fixed the issue .
also it is light weight compared to others .
Apple care included .
i FINALLY DID IT AND THIS MACHINE IS THE WAY TO GO !
The fact that the screen reacts to the lighting around you is an added luxury-when you are working around others in dark areas and want privacy or do n't want to bother them with bright lighting , it is very convenient to have a darker , softer lit screen .
The computer loads in about a 1/10th of the time that my PC did , and I have all of the programs that were on my PC .
I did have to replace the battery once , but that was only a couple months ago and it 's been working perfect ever since .
I looked around and based off my price/features comparison from a brand I trusted I landed here .
I do n't do any high tech stuff on it , just write papers , check mail , and sometimes play games , so I ca n't reccomend it if you are in the computer field .
the only thing that bums me out about this purchase is they released a newer updated mbp seriously RIGHT after i bought this one .
Newegg 's RMA service was great as always , I contacted them late Friday night , and they issued me an RMA number and a PrePaid UPS shipping label the very next morning on Saturday .
I am paying apple to kill my self and my wallet .
It is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed .
Not to mention it has shit gigs .
Thank God for " ctrl Z " Bottom line , I 've been using laptops since the mid 90s and probably the majority of brands out there .
Quietest laptop I have ever owned .
The new Macbook Pro 15 inch i7 is nothing short of amazing .
he ca n't stand it .
The 2.9 ghz dual-core i7 chip really out does itself .
The first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty .
I am very happy with my first Mac .
My husband got me this for Chrismas after getting me a very expensve laptop that did not work after 2 days .
Now I know !
If you are a PC user looking to convert I would HIGHLY recommend it !
So glad I decided to upgrade !
- I give up on my data , I just want a computer reasonably fast ...
I bought a protector for my key pad and it works great : )
The price is great for this model , I only plan on using it for media in the entertainment room .
I dislike the weight and size , cubersome .
A veryimportant feature is Firewire 800 which in my experience works better then USB3 ( in PC enabled with USB3 ) I was not originally sold on the MAC OS I felt it was inferior in many ways To Windows 7 .
The only thing that I have , is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters , would help if it was a little lighter then it is .
The only task that this computer would not be good enough for would be gaming , otherwise the integrated Intel 4000 graphics work well for other tasks .
The applications are also very easy to find and maneuver , much easier than any other computer I have ever owned .
They also use two totally different operating systems .
I needed a laptop with big storage , a nice screen and fast so I can photoshop without any problem .
I love WIndows 7 which is a vast improvment over Vista .
My sister has the same Mac as me and she is in a band and uses GarageBand to record and edit .
However , this laptop has a fatal flaw that i discovered merely a week after buying it .
I connect a LaCie 2Big external drive via the firewire 800 interface , which is useful for Time Machine .
1 ) Payed $ 2200 for a " premium " laptop
Called Acer many times , they want me to pay the shipping to ship it to their repair center - I was very disappointed since it is a brand new computer !
With in weeks of purchasing my computer is began to slow down .
HP said it was out of warranty .
I 'm all for saving money but Dell needs to step it up .
It 's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook .
Within a few hours I was using the gestures unconsciously .
it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once .
I never tried any external mics with that iMac .
The internet was locekd and froze every time it was trying to be used , and the command prompt would not work at all .
The only problems are the sound isnt very loud I have to wear headphones .
Might not make the avid gamer happy but I do n't really think that is what this computer is designed for .
But while this is one big advantage ( as you may know from the company s recent commercials ) there are other things to consider before going with Apple .
From the moment I opened the box to the present it has been a great joy .
Before we got this laptop , had a compaq pasaro for 5 years with no problems .
Really great ... Well let me start at the beginning .
Keyboard good sized and wasy to use .
I like this machine because its very lightweight ...
I believe that the quality of a mac is worth the price .
You will fall in love with it in no time .
My only complaint is the total lack of instructions that come with the mac mini .
As well as having the plug in the computer come loose .
It gives me the power and speed that I need to run all the programs I use to edit .
Well , I have to say since I bought my Mac , I wo n't ever go back to any Windows .
Getting the Apple Care plan is a must .
super fast processor and really nice graphics card . .
! so nice . . stable . . fast . . now i got my SSD !
Returned laptop for repair a 2nd time and it came back with obvious physical damage ( keyboard bulging and speaker grill pressed in ) , buttons not working and USB ports inoperative .
All the things you can do with the trackpad make navigating around the computer and its programs so much simpler , quicker , and easier .
I have other computers that get strong signals that do n't drop in places that this " net " book loses its signal .
I think I might rather suffer for something that is simple to fix in my opinion .
) And printing from either word processor is an adventure .
The operating system and user interface is very intuitive , and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing .
I decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it .
It had a cooling system malfunction after 10 minutes of general use , and would not move past this error .
The apple MacBook is the best investment that I have ever made .
The Bluetooth was not there at all , and the fingerprint reader driver would be there , but the software would hang after installation was 1/2 way done .
It has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer .
No hassle and no complaints .
They are so realistic I am just speechless .
The exterior is absolutely gorgeous .
Keys stick periodically and I havent had the laptop for 45 days yet .
The computer continued to give me issues and in Late June it completely died again and I tried to call Acer again to get it fixed and they refused to help me , they said my warrenty was up and hung up on me .
- They reported that the computer is in their headquarters .
but after i got used to it i love it .
this is my second one and the same problem , bad video card unreliable overall , this will be my second time returning this laptop back to best buy .
Screen is awesome , battery life is good .
Let 's just get this out of the way , I love Apple !
A great college tool !
" For one , I noticed that from turning on my mac to logging on only took about 25 seconds .
It has plenty of memory , lots of hard drive , and great graphics .
My smart phone is faster !
If I had to buy another computer , I would most definetly buy an acer one computer .
Its a good laptop for its value .
I love the form factor .
iTunes is a handy music-management program , and it is essential for anyone with an iPod .
Shiny This Laptop is the Best of the best !
Have not yet needed any customer support with this yet so to me that is a great thing , which is leaps and bounds ahead of PC in my opinion .
You 'll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them .
I took it back for an Asus and same thing - blue screen which required me to remove the battery to reset .
I use iphoto all the time , which is a great program for anyone who is into photography - amateurs and experts alike .
It will make life so much easier next semester , just wish I had it last semester !!
It is so nice not to worry about that and the extra expense that comes along with the necessary virus protection on PC 's .
I like the laptop overall .
Thank you so much for the great item .
This is a great little computer for the price .
Its fast , easy to use and it looks great .
The bottom-line is that this laptop just is n't worth it .
Windows also shuts the computer down for no reason without warning .
Now the screen is going darker , darker , darker .
I spent 2200 dollars on a " top of the line laptop " .
I respond that I do not have the old computer and this way I would lose the data on my hard drive .
I 'm excited to learn more about what this powerful machine has to offer and encourage others to do the same .
I have just had to learn to be a little harder typer than on my last computer .
sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move .
really no problems with the hand me down computers I received from my children .
I have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it fixed because it has had viruses 3 times and i have not even had it for more then 4 months !
The first programm I switched on was a game for my children .
They click .
* 5 weeks after giving the computer for repair * - Apple offers to send replacement after they receive the old computer .
First it burned or fused the power adapter plug .
This was a gift for my grand son .
As a graphic arts a retired instructor I still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art .....
It feels cheap , the keyboard is not very sensitive .
Though you get a polite person , you often don t get a solution .
The only thing I can imagine is that Sony jumped on early specifications for Vista requirements from Microsoft and designed it to those inadequate requirements .
Buy this if you like being tortured , teased , frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old Mac .
I love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention PC 's require .
The memory was gone and it was not able to be used .
They also have a longer service life than other computers ( I have several friends who still use the older Apple PowerBooks ) .
thanks for great service and shipping !
I have had two Toshiba satellite computers and while they are okay , they are in no way comparable to the Mac .
I can do pretty much 75 % of what I do on my desktop on my kitchen table .
Lord HAVE MERCY !
This machine rocks !
I upgraded the memory and replaced the base Windows 7 Starter to Win 7 Home , and it runs just fine .
The improvements to the OS have been relatively gradual , but substantive .
I got the first " Blue screen of death " in the early part of July .
The real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and it 's speed .
Summary : They played games with me for the warranty period .
Another issue I have with it is the battery .
There was a little difficulty doing the migration as the firewire cable system ca n't be used with the iBook .
After about another month I had to send it in AGAIN to Acer for repairs .
It was quite easy .
i had the bulk of problems with my lap top within the first six months .
I took the computer back in yet again except this time they kept it to send into their Geek Squad headquarters .
and they replaced the awesome ergonomic small lightweight power supply with a power supply that weighed more than the machine itself .
I wiped nearly everything off of it , installed OpenOffice and Firefox , and I am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price .
The new MacBook is lightyears ahead of my old white plastic MacBook circa 2006 .
compresses itself and you ca n't use it .
1st hand experience is very important , especially for a new customer .
I challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it .
seriously why have n't they just replaced it by now .
So I 'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority .
Wonderful sleek case design is only on the outside .
So when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand .
The machine is used , but is like new , i 'm very impress .
It 's so nice that the battery last so long and that this machine has the snow lion !
I could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat .
I think that they are the best out on the market .
I bought this Mac book pro along with a new 27 " iMac and while they are still light years more reliable than a PC I have noticed a decline in the reliability of my Mac computers .
I Hate it !
apple and quess what , you have to send the whole laptop in , too bad , so sad
I am finding my way around this laptop better than my last one .
Charger seems large for this class of computer .
There is no " tools " menu .
It 's a nice little gadget .
Its pretty fast and does not have hiccups while I am using it for web browsing , uploading photos , watching movies ( 720p ) on occasion and creating presentations .
I was WRONG !
It still serves me well both in business and home needs .
I took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and I finally paid about 1500 for the extended warranty .
I loved it .
The downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook : screen size is not something I 'd stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week .
I LOVE it !
I would recommend Mac , and do , to anyone looking to buy a new computer .
I 've been a PC user and I just finally switched and I am never going back .
I bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her , it 's very lightweight , and the response for the computing she 's doing ( Internet focused activity : mail , research , etc. ) is excellent ;
I took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one .
Just be careful ; you always have to give up some good stuff for others .
I am a college student and it has been very useful .
i dont understand why i spent twice as much to get a laptop rather than a desktop when my lap top is completely immoble .
The 17 inch screen is very large , but the computer is very light .
Even with virus protection , it always turned off when updates were needed and installed .
Obviously , this Macbook is P-E-R-F-E-C-T for me because it does exactly what I need in an easy-to-function way .
I have used a computer at work but having your own personal laptop is AWSOME !
This is perfect for her field .
The one thing I wish it had was a detailed hardcopy manuel .
previous laptops were pc 's , still have them , but the mac osx is a clean and smooth operating system .
They are wonderful , but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat .
In the short time of one month since the 2012 Mac Mini was released there are well over 1000 posts regarding this issue and the numbers keep rising .
My friends or children use that when they need to borrow the Net =) When I out grow this Meaning when its old and my oldest child is ready for one she will get this one ANd I will be buying only TOSHIBA !
It will be returned in the state to which it was shipped Michigan .
The great 18 month same as cash financing and Advance Protection Plan which includes accidents like spills .
I 'm going back to PC .
i have dropped mine a couple times with only a slim plastic case covering it .
During that time , I had to send it back 3 times .
I took it home and within 30 min , it was freezing up and did the " blue screen of death " .
The brand of iTunes has just become ingrained in our lexicon now , but keep in mind that Apple started it all .
I had in the past a Dell laptop and they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair technician to my house to fix it .
And I 'm still paying the bloody financing , for a product which did n't last me at least three years !
Finally , the biggest problem has been tech support .
It is so much easier to use
So a couple of years later , I was a dumb college girl and had to have the wireless internet .
Was skeptical about buying an electronic item online but it turned out to be a positive experience .
After having two PC laptops die with in the past 3 years , I was led to the Apple display at Best Buy by the sleek design and promise of less tech issues .
All in all , I 'm incredibly dissatisfied with this laptop , and with HP as a whole .
Then it ceased charging at all .
Does everything I wanted this laptop to do .
After numerous calls to Applecare tech support , I was directed to send in my computer ;
Biggest complaint is Windows 8 .
It doesnt overheat or make any loud noises .
I just got this laptop for college , and so far I am very happy with it .
The speakers on it are useless too .
I like the Mini Mac it was easy to setup and install , but I am learning as I go and could use a tutorial to learn how to use some of the features I was use to on the PC especially the right mouse click menu .
I love the 15 " MacBook Pro .
I am still in the process of learning about its features .
They would repair one thing , send it back and it would still have the same problem .
I have never had any issues or problems with my MacBook Pro so far , and it is still as fast as it was when I first bought it .
That includes transferring my music and movies .
And now I am a proud MacBook owner also !
So do n't get it .
I am currently out of town and called to inform them the broken part would be returned when I got back in town .
power supply went bad after 2 weeks --
This computer is also awesome for my sons virtual home schooling .
It is very user friendly and not hard to figure out at all .
I BOUGHT THIS LAP TOP AND THE CHARGE TIME DOSE N'T LAST AS LONG AS THEY SAY IT WILL MORE LIKE 2 HOURS
While I mostly use it for email , internet and gaming , I 'm confident all other applications live up to the high standard I 've come to appreciate from Mac laptops .
My sisters same laptop broke about the month later for the same reason .
I know Apples are more expensive than PCs , but he thinks it is worth every penny .
it is hard to fix and makes it a hassle to own one .
I got the black MacBook two years ago and have never regretted it .
So much faster and sleeker looking .
I am an Info Sys major in college , so I started researching this issue on my own .
I upgraded from a 5 year old laptop and was amazed to find out that this computer is much slower then my old laptop .
* 2 weeks after giving the computer for repair * - Called headquarters , they report that they have not looked at it yet but it is " on the top of the stack " .
Anyway , in early July of this year , the DVD burner stopped working , and the computer stared having issues with power supply .
I HATE this one .
Have returned that laptop unused .
The technical support was not helpful as well .
I would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an easy to use , stylish , fun , awesome computer .
I think that if it is the motherboard again so soon that they should replace it .
I personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers .
Do you ever think HP would do that ? NEVER !
AND the best part is that it even comes with a free printer ( when they have a certain promotion/offer going , of course ) !
If anything , I would only suggest using one of these laptops if only you have to .
still testing the battery life as i thought it would be better , but am very happy with the upgrade .
Other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more .
I had a little problem adjusting to the small screen but works fine as long as I remember to carry my glasses .
If that is the case for you , I would suggest a pull-behind solution when looking at cases .
I 've had my computer for 2 weeks already and it works perfectly .
Since I never really got to use this , I ca n't comment on anything except what went wrong after trying 2 of them .
It is very easy to navigate even for a novice .
I also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad .
It 's color is even cool .
I also love the design , the looks , the feel , and the my toshiba feature is wonderfull .
not something you want to miss out on !!!
I started hainv problems with it within the first month .
I am just ONE of the million customers .
I 'm going back to DELL .
I 'll stick to Tashiba .
while the keyboard itself is alright , the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the mouse command buttons .
The keyboard is too slick .
Toshiba is a great brand , even though I have n't had it for a long time , I am very happy with it !
might have to buy one for me now , since I use it all the time .
However , there are MAJOR issues with the touchpad which render the device nearly useless .
This is especially disheartening when Apple prides itself as the choice of creative professionals .
As an owner of a Toshiba Satalite laptop computer things you should know before you buy .
If you do n't like fingerprints , this might not be the laptop for you .
Not a scratch or mark on it .
It is easy to use , good quality and good price .
It is loaded with programs that is of no good for the average user , that makes it run way to slow .
I am loving the fast performance also .
I sent it back and found this time that the battery was faulty , so I got a new one and some other fixes they found .
I seem to be having repeat problems as the Mother Board in this one is diagnosed as faulty , related to the graphics card .
Why not 5 stars ?
I also wanted Windows 7 , which this one has .
It was definelty a smart move .
Then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me .
I always have used a tower home PC and jumped to the laptop and have been very satisfied with its performance .
The delivery was fast , and I would not hesitate to purchase this laptop again .
I visited the Apple Store and was impressed with the 17-inch MacBook Pro .
BTW , I checked online regarding the old laptop that ' died ' and found that I was not alone , far from it .
It is also very lightweight , making transporting this computer very easy .
If you are looking for something reliable , this is the laptop for you .
It is not an easy decision to purchase a used or even good as new laptop but I am very satisfied .
It is extremely user friendly and intuitive .
Your cursor will end up all over the freaking place , , , it 's not uncommon for me to accidentally delete words , sentences , paragraphs because of this mousepad .
They sent out the box right away for me to send in my computer , they paid postage and whatnot , but when I got my computer back it still was n't running right , and now my CD drive was n't reading anything !
The salesman talked us into this computer away from another we were looking at and we have had nothing but problems with software problems and just not happy with it .
Yeah , to you .
While lacking some of the functions of the other versions , this was very acceptable for the uses planned for this computer .
Did n't work when shipped from Walmart.com but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop ( same make/model ) .
My Iphone synced right up just like a person would expect , unlike the PCs in our lives .
Also , in using the built-in camera , my voice recording for my vlog sounds like the interplanetary transmissions in the " Star Wars " saga .
Temperatures on the outside were alright but i did not track in Core Processing Unit temperatures .
Since I purchased my Toshiba netbook , I have been very pleased with it , I have a laptob and a desktop .
The lesson learned here is : It does not pay to by this loyal to any brand , since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible , as fast as they can , and in this day and age , the customer no longer is right all the times .
The programs that come standard with the Leopard running system are enough for the average person to run all the basics .
This ai n't it .
My hp G60-244dx died after only 16 months .
So if you move laptop a lot , it might get loose , however it sits pretty tightly .
Also , it hardly ever crashes .
Be safe buy a Sony .
It is easy to use , its keyboard easily accommodates large hands , and its weight is fantasic .
3 weeks went by and the computer keeps crashing and will not open any applications .
It 's software and speed enable it to do amazing things .
It 's so quick and responsive that it makes working/surfing on a computer so much more pleasurable !
it was a tough choice .
The only thing I wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16 " laptop does .
Then the system would many times not power down without a forced power-off .
It is extremely portable and easily connects to WIFI at the library and elsewhere .
This laptop serves all my needs .
It does n't heat up like my old laptop .
