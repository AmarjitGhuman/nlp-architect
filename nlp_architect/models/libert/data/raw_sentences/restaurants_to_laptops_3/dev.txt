This computer does everything i need it to do for school and more .
It bluescreened on me without any warning , running simply basic Chrome .
Since I keyboard over 100 wpm , I look for a unit that has a comfortble keyboard ( no keys sticking or lagging , strange configuration of " extra key " , etc .
I was sorly disapointed to discover that HP ( what I thought was a reputable company ) would n't honor the warrenty when the fan blade fell apart .
at first !
The Nortons virus scan is only for a very short time unlike others that usually are good for a year .
This computer does n't do that well with certain games it ca n't play some and it becomes too hot while playing games .
That is pretty sad when they name them specifically .
I would not recommend this product to anyone .
NO more Lenovo for me .
Hard disk - The new editions gives you more hard disk space ( 500GB instead of 320GB ) but time has taught me never to trust an internal hard disk .
If it 's not shipped on the next business day , called on a Friday they are closed on weekends , what was the next step .
The extended warranty for the $ 4000 and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu .
Screen is awesome , battery life is good .
UPDATE : Two years after buying this laptop , I am now the proud owner of a lemon .
Many kinds of software that is necessary to the working person is not available and can not be downloaded .
It 's fast , light , and simple to use .
It 's solid .
HP is more interested in selling extended warranties ( which cost more than the netbook new ) then they are in helping or fixing .
They are so realistic I am just speechless .
Harddrive was in poor condition , had to replace it .
The black model also has a very nice seamless appearance - one of the better looking notebooks I 've seen .
I would never buy a Dell again .
I eventually did the migration from my iMac backup disc which uses USB .
The battery is really long .
No installation disk ( DVD ) is included .
this is one of the reasons I purchased it .
Time will tell .
Have used only Macs for years .
They removed them and returned the computer to me .
If you need an affordable , entry-level laptop , this will fit the bill .
This laptop is the most amazing little peice of machinery I have owned outside of the Iphone .
I love this laptop , and use it everyday to do something , and never lets me down .
Well i got this computer from Best Buy and I have had nothing but problems I bought the computer with a virus .....
They say that this will invalidate the warranty on the hard drive ( I do n't really understand why but anyway ) .
Before , I reloaded with Windows 7 Ultimate and used only the downloaded drivers from Acer 's site .
First of all yes this is a mac and it has that nice brushed aluminum .
He came into my house , fiddled around on the computer for a good forty minutes and got ready to leave before it was even done doing what he was doing to it .
The Toshiba laptop I am using is easier to use than most I have tried .
After paying over $ 1000 for this computer , it was not worth it .
I can leave my MacBook uncharged for upwards of eight hours and it wo n't even be dead .
( Beware , their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a computer is .
However , If I sound enthusiastic about this , I am !
So far it has been five months since the last problem was fixed and I am PRAYING it has finally stopped .
Otherwise this little notebook has met all my expectations .
Typically , when I purchase a new laptop I always end up using an external mouse for convenience .
It is a great size and amazing windows 8 included !
I loaded windows 7 via Bootcamp and it works flawlessly !
I 'm hoping that I can find a really quick way to clean it without it getting too gross .
But if you are in the computer field you probably would n't be here .
They have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and I 'm looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular .
Seems a much more economical way to get into Apple than their other computers .
I own other Macs but always find myself navigation to the MacBook Pro to get my work done .
So then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back , but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened , and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the repair ( the price of a new one ) .
I blame the Mac OS .
My brother is a computer wiz and would laugh at me because he used an Apple .
I 've had friends with Acers who seem to have had similar or exact same problems .
Disappointing for such a lovely screen and at a reasonable price
This is what I call a good after sales service .
The price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop .
The acer one computer that I bought is 17 ince screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it , but I like the big screen on it .
THIS IS MY SECOND MAC BOOK PRO .
First of all , they had no record of me having the 3 year warranty I 'd paid almost $ 400 for , and I had to call in , spend hours on their online chat service , and fax in multiple documents .
The capabilities using that program alone made me want a Mac .
Yet my mac continues to function properly .
I feel that it was poorly put together , because once in a while different plastic pieces would come off of it .
So , the hard disk capacity really does n't matter to me .
It pretty much does everything we could ever need , and looks great to boot .
The other day I had a presentation to do for a seminar at a large conference in town - lots of people , little time to prep and have to set up a computer to a projector , etc .
But the mountain lion is just too slow .
Gave phonenumber .
tosiba has a good reputation , my llast computer was an acer .
I did not like my acer .
This mac has been a problem since we got it .
Do n't buy this model .
I got what I paid for .
After replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working ( 3 months of use ) which was frustrating .
Windows Vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service .
You wo n't be disappointed .
Thank you Best Buy for putting my computer together and installing my first software - you guys were GREAT too !
Hopefully Amazon will take this back .
Recommended to people as their first laptop .
The acer one compuer is a great computer .
Actually , I had noticed the one on the sales floor also did n't have sound !
It is better than my old acer laptop .
I still have that stupid bluetooth mouse to !
I just fell in love with this thing .
We were occasional Mac users before , but most recently owned a budget PC since it is what we could afford .
Sound card is limited though .
Was searching online for a power supply when I found this site .
Came with iPhoto and garage band already loaded .
the only thing that bums me out about this purchase is they released a newer updated mbp seriously RIGHT after i bought this one .
I opted for the SquareTrade 3-Year Computer Accidental Protection Warranty ( $ 1500-2000 ) which also support " accidents " like drops and spills that are NOT covered by AppleCare .
Simple to use , and great graphics .
( You may be reading one now !
I just ca n't fathom that the celebrated Dell would last a week in environment of free competition with normal products - it only survives b/c its substandard laptops are forced onto captive students and employees through question-raising programs .
Great laptop for school , easy to use for beginners in the household .
I am glad I did my research .
I have owned many different brands of laptops in my life .
When my Dell laptop gave up only after 2 1/2 years , I decided to buy MacBook Pro .
I would like at least a 4 hr . battery life .
And the ram ( the thing that makes it faster ) comes sporting 2 gigs for high performance to handle more stuff at once and surf the web a whole lot faster than before .
so we got a good deal on hsn for an ascer notebook and we bought it for him .
Before i bought my new i5 , I did my research for about 2 weeks and determined to move for HP to Apple for reliability , dependable , and long lasting operations .
Get this instead , you wo n't be sorry .
Two , owning a 17 in.mac book gives the flexibility to sit anywhere you want without worry about bother anyone .
The track pad to me is what really stands out though , you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pad , awesome thinking Apple !
I have never had an experience like this .
The speakers are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones I have ever seen in a laptop so if your planning to listen to music I suggest you get something better .
In fact , he said , about 10 % of their products fail .
you can find many laptops with the same performance and even better with lower price , but you can not find the look , easy , applications , and the experience in mac .
We upgraded the memory to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace increase in speed .
Accordingly , I have decided to NEVER purchase another HP product ( my five year old Compaq ) lasted 5-years before the hard drive crashed .
The real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and it 's speed .
The computer loads in about a 1/10th of the time that my PC did , and I have all of the programs that were on my PC .
I have used a couple of others on the job as well .
A key contributor that led me to Mac is the art aspect .
We were PC users .
It makes doing schoolwork at night so much easier .
She told me flatly , " It 's like that one .
The computer was two weeks late in delivery because HP forgot to complete the required import paperwork .
But my blog is read by my friends and search engine visitors .
I really wish I had done this years ago .
The one thing that Apple does right is computers .
It is very fast and has everything that I need except for a word program .
Overall this laptop is great .
The Aspire wont even boot past the Acer screen with a Droid ( I have tried both Motorola and HTC ) plugged into the USB port .
12.44 seconds to boot .
The Dell mini was the first Dell product that I had ever purchased .
It will make life so much easier next semester , just wish I had it last semester !!
The technical service for dell is so 3rd world it might as well not even bother .
I am most impressed with the programming , including the iPhoto .
great machine if you want to drop the cash for one .
Design : very durable .
defective software .
The battery holds up well , it 's built very solidly , and runs fast .
Works well , and I am extremely happy to be back to an apple OS .
its as advertised on here .... . it works great and is not a waste of money !
Has met or exceeded my needs for a compact travel device .
They went through asking me open up various components , taking battery out , hard disk apart , and after 2 hours on phone could not fix it .
/ awesome cooling system / much better grafics card ( ATI 5870 ) / 8GB RAM / LED backlit screen ...
) And printing from either word processor is an adventure .
Fast , great visual !
Buy this if you like being tortured , teased , frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old Mac .
They were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place .
They have more problems then a 1980 's computer .
Additionally , there is barely a ventilation system in the computer , and even the simple activity of watching videos let alone playing steam games causes the laptop to get very very hot , and in fact impossible to keep on lap .
It really is perfect for work and play .
excellent in every way .
Very very disappointed !
Otherwise , all other features are a 1
I like the laptop overall .
I had to get Apple Customer Support to correct the problem .
I needed a laptop with big storage , a nice screen and fast so I can photoshop without any problem .
Another THREE weeks later I had my laptop back with a new mousepad , keys , and casing .
This newer netbook has no hard drive or network lights .
I could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage .
I 'm very impressed .
I do find that my MacBook has a lot more bells and whistles than a normal PC especially if you enjoy technology , downloading pictures and graphic design .
We are addicted to the Mac .
Apple removed the DVD drive Firewire port ( will work with adapter ) and put the SDXC slot in a silly position on the back .
I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality !
It is a much more streamlined system for adding programs , using the internet , and doing other things everyone does on a computer .
But I wanted the Pro for the CD/DVD player .
It seems to be incompatible with everything else .
I shopped around before buying .
I play a lot of casual games online , and the touchpad is very responsive .
The processor a AMD Semprom at 2.1 ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for HD or heavy computing .
Here are the things that made me confident with my purchase : Build Quality - Seriously , you ca n't beat a unibody construction .
think i would spend little extra to get a better made laptop .
I could n't believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge .
" This is n't a big deal , I have n't noticed the issue with DVDs or other media , only through USB output .
It 's also very energy efficient , running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a 60 Watt lightbulb .
The technical support was not helpful as well .
Ca n't wait until I go on vacation and take it with me .
There were small problems with Mac office .
It was a hard decision for me since the MacBook Pro looked so appealing .
Everything is so easy and intuitive to setup or configure .
I have had at least eight Toshiba laptops , and they have been outstanding , including this one .
Runs like a champ .....
I have used PC 's and converting to this MacBook Pro was easy .
I use iphoto all the time , which is a great program for anyone who is into photography - amateurs and experts alike .
It 's catatonic .
You know what ? I happened to buy a defective blood pressure monitor a week ago at the Bukit Batok Polyclinic NHG Pharmacy a week ago .
My friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance , picture quality , and ease of use .
I loved it .
You just lose a customer .
I was extremely happy with the OS itself .
For this purpose , it 's great .
The people there just changed for me on the spot and I got a new arm piece and they did n't even request for a receipt .
I have now had it for 1.5 months and love it .
There are reviews that speak to a few possible glitches but , I have n't seen them yet .
Maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden .
Getting the Apple Care plan is a must .
You may need to special order a bag .
Its also FUN to use !
If the number of patrons in the Apple store are any indication , HP and other PC manufacturers need to take note .
The Apple will run Internet Explorer , but at an amazingly slow rate .
Pay attention to the specs if you want these options .
Being a PC user my whole life , it 's taking a bit of time to adapt to the OS of a Mac but I 'm finding my way around .
I previously purchased a 13 " macbook ( had pro specs and was aluminum style ) which had a nvidia 9800 ( If I am not mistaken ) and it had major heating issues .
Not sure how I recommend it for quality gaming , as I have a desktop rig for that reason .
I agree with the previous comment that ASUS TECH SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE WHICH IS A CON IN MY OPINION .
Buy this .
Many of my classmates computers hard drives crashed .
I had to re-install Windows within two weeks of the purchase and soon discovered cracks in the screen hinges .
The speakers on it are useless too .
At first it 's like you 're in that honeymoon stage with your laptop .
Incredible graphics and brilliant colors .
However I dealt with this problem for over a year and it was more of a hastle then I have EVER had with anything .
it is an amazing image and it too is holding up quite nicely to little hands grabbing the back of my laptop .
So think about factoring those things in when you purchase .
A longer battery life would have been great - but it meets it 's spec quite easily .
And , if you are going to deal with HP be careful .
Overall : Poor , Features : Average , Performance : Poor , Battery Life : Excellent , Price-Value : Poor
It 's not a wear-and-tear issue , not due to user carelessness and most importantly , they CA N'T guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and I have to accept the outcome .
I 'm pleased .
this is starting off good .
It is a cheap throw together .
also ... - excellent operating system - size and weight for optimal mobility - excellent durability of the battery - the functions provided by the trackpad is unmatched by any other brand -
It 's a nice little gadget .
The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months , stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes .
The programs that come standard with the Leopard running system are enough for the average person to run all the basics .
i have had my dell latitude for almost three years .
They do n't seem to be susceptible to viruses , which is one less big thing to worry about when it comes to computers .
My husband purchased a laptop at the same time for about $ 300 less ( he got a pc ) .
It is the best laptop ever !!!
At first , I feel a little bit uncomfortable in using the Mac system .
I had to wait 3 weeks to get it back and it still is not working properly .
DO NOT BUY GATEWAY COMPUTERS THEY ARE JUNK AND THE WARRANTY COMPANY IS HORRIBLE .
The reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me ( I prefer it dark ) or if you can crank up the brightness .
I was really happy because it is a much better price on amazon.com than it was in the Mac store .
After doing extensive research , macconnection had the lowest price on the 15 " MBP i5 .
A veryimportant feature is Firewire 800 which in my experience works better then USB3 ( in PC enabled with USB3 ) I was not originally sold on the MAC OS I felt it was inferior in many ways To Windows 7 .
Right out of the box , this little netbook did everything I asked of it , including streaming the everyday video you 're bound to encounter checking mail and websites ( my biggest complaint previously ) .
Everything is so easy to use , Mac software is just so much simpler than Microsoft software .
Since I 've had this computer I 've only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth .
One drawback , I wish the keys were backlit .
There is nothing to complain about the system .
It is very well built .
It is not even a year old yet , so I would definitely not recommend it to anyone .
Well , I bought this laptop a month or two ago .
It 's fast , light , and is perfect for media editing , which is mostly why I bought it in the first place .
He gave me this PC about 3 years ago and up to this point im still sitting here using it .
I reloaded with Windows 7 Ultimate , and the Bluetooth and Fingerprint reader ( software ) would not load .
I 'm still within the one year warranty but the repair " depot " has deemed that this time it was caused by physical abuse and is not covered .
Games being the main issue .
It 's so quick and responsive that it makes working/surfing on a computer so much more pleasurable !
I will only buy apple laptops from now on .
Needs constant repair .
Easy learning curve .
I have had the luxury ( sarcasm ) of owning 2 of these laptops .
It is BLAZING fast !
Well I spilled something on it and they replaced it with this model , which gets hot and the battery does n't make it through 1 DVD .
I called Toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem .
Bought this gateway M-50 or 150 early 2007 .
It was secure and easy to navigate .
The best thing to do is build your own computer , but if u ca n't company 's like dell who allow you to choose the components are better and for the same price you can get a computer who compares to one of apple $ 2000 systems and if you google " dell coupons " you can find codes that take a signifant amount off the price .
After sending out documents via email and having recipients tell me they could not open the documents or they came through as gibberish , I broke down and spent another $ 100 to get Microsoft Word for Mac .
By Air sounds more like by truck to Me .
She brought out 2 other identical netbooks and still insist that " It is like that one " .
This laptop rocks ( only wish it could run SolidWorks CAD - which Apple does n't support ) !
So you do n't get frustrated the first few weeks .
WiFi capability , disk drive and multiple USB ports to connect scale and printers was all that was required .
- Called MacHouse Amsterdam to ask for a temporary replacement , no answer .
The battery life also does n't keep up with the claim but still I think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack .
1 . You can not change your desktop background ( window 's 7 starter does NOT support that function ) .
I had upgraded my old MacBook to Lion , so I kind of knew what I was getting , but had n't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features .
I am not happy with my purchase
Then 2 of my nephews were going into music and both fell in love with the MacBook Pro .
Also , in using the built-in camera , my voice recording for my vlog sounds like the interplanetary transmissions in the " Star Wars " saga .
I can not even read what I am writing half of the time .
I will NEVER buy ( Refurbished ) again , I do n't cae how cheap it is .
Still pretty pricey , but I 've been putting off money for a while as a little Macbook Fund , and finally got to use it .
Its only crashed on me one time in the 3 months i 've had it .
oh yeah , and if the fancy webcam breaks guess who you have to send it to to get it fixed ?
The video card is great for media , and above average for gaming , but not a gamers first choice .
My power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership , so it was covered by the Applecare warranty plan .
Have one myself and Love it !
luckly i had a student task force able to help , or else it would have crashed within the first year .
And i would recommend this to anypne looking for a new laptop .
I know what 7 hrs of battery looks like .
So needless to day , I 'm not happy .
i would have to say that overall its great !
not using wired lan not sure what thats about .
The item received was exactly as identified .
Dell wanted to charge us for everything everytime I called them with a problem .
Just What I Needed For Portable And My Wallet Too !
Had to have this computer repaired twice in the first 5 months after purchasing it .
) only to get another " HP/Compaq " piece of crap .
I spent months looking for a good laptop for me and I finally found it !
go for it !
Nothing bad to say about it .
Vista is a nightmare .
Took it back as it was defective .
I was so excited when my dad said i could get a new laptop for my birthday .
I understand I should call Apple Tech Support about any variables ( which is my purpose of writing this con ) as variables could be a bigger future problem .
It is easy to use and lightweight .
The battery was completely dead , in fact it had grown about a quarter inch thick lump on the underside .
The difference is the Toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space .
I tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and I still have the same problem .
They 're not safe , they 're not durable , they just a worthless .
OSX Mountain Lion soon to upgrade to Mavericks .
Everything about this computer is easy to use .
Built-in apps are purely amazing .
If you buy , pray you dont have major prolems .
I waited to review to make sure it is what it is .
3 ) Horrible customer support
The case is now slightly larger than the previous generation , but the lack of an external power supply justifies the small increase in size .
Look up recipes and keep it on the kitchen counter while I cook .
Performance is much much better on the Pro , especially if you install an SSD on it .
I would never tell anyone to buy one either .
But the arm velcro is torn after one use .
A coupla months later , they change my hard drive .
Other installed features , such as certain printer software , are also most attractive .
I 've had my MacBook Pro for three years now and still love it !
All the ports are much needed since this is my main computer .
Now , as easy as it is to use , and I do think it is a great STARTER laptop .
* IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD LAPTOP , THIS IS NOT IT !
I ca n't even turn it off .
The layout of the MacBook is horrible and confusing ;
Its good for playing my apps on Facebook or watching movies .
Summary : Spend your money elsewhere
After all was said and done , I essentially used that $ 450 savings to buy 16GB of RAM , TWO Seagate Momentus XT hybrid drives and an OWC upgrade kit to install the second hard drive .
bought the first asus laptop in san francisco , returned it in santa maria , thinking it was just a problem with that computer .
Excellent speed for processing data .
Note , however , that any existing MagSafe accessories you have will not work with the MagSafe 2 connection .
So , I 'm cooled on Mac buys .
Finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a Walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box .
Needless to say I told them No and have a nice day and hung up !
The Hewitt Packard Pavillion dv6700 was my first laptop , before this I had a Dell desktop that I loved .
There is no " tools " menu .
I upgraded it 's RAM to 2GB , I am very happy with it .
and the multiple page viewer ( allows you to press one button to see every separate page currently opened at the same time in one screen ) are great for those who are working non stop or just shopping online .
( For those old enough to remember , it is similar to Beta versus VHS .
The only thing I dislike about this laptop are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the computer for grip .
i setup my password last night with the password on my other computer .
HP said I had done the damage .
Gradually the freezing screen evolved into a screen that froze in weird shapes .
I bought this netbook for traveling , and it 's great - light , functional , and meets my needs .
Going to bring it to service today .
Cons : Screen resolution .
Great overall .
I am however pleased that it is still hanging in there .
Screen is bright and gorgeous .
It is everything I 'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint , but somehow a bit more sturdy .
This is another reason to like the Mac .
Also , my sister got the exact same laptop ( since they were so cheap ) and after 8 months , the screen split in half just from everyday use .
I also did not like the loud noises it made or how the bottom of the computer would get really hot .
it might be something deep within Windows , for I was unable to create a disk image on my hard drive .
The battery life is amazing , the versitility is outstanding .
Ok first .
I have always wanted a MacBook Pro ..... always !
The Mac Snow Leopard O/S is extremely easy to use , although very different than Win XP , Visa or Win7 .
The last new mac I bought was in 1998 .
I now own another Hewlitt Packard .
There is NO way I will buy a LG product in the future .
I 'll wait and save up for a new one .
Toshiba knows there is a manufacturing defect but will not acknowledge it .
I like those programs better than Office and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the Office programs as well .
One more thing , this mac does NOT come with restore disks and I am not sure if you can make them direct from the mac like you can with newer PC 's , also the charging cables are made of the same cheap material as the iPhone/iPod touch cables .
It had the full sized touch pad with 2 buttons instead of just one .
Processor - When compared to my 3 week old Early 2011 edition there I barely experience any difference in performance ( 2.3 GHz v/s 2.4 GHz ) .
Not to mention , the battery life is absolutely amazing .
This thing sucks !
If I have a problem with any of my apple items I make an appointment at one of my local stores and they work on correcting it right there .
$ 999.00 Tax free .
great battery life .
It is a bit heavy .
I am currently out of town and called to inform them the broken part would be returned when I got back in town .
He LEFT ME , instructions on what to do when this comes up , or that comes up ......
They claim that I should be happy because I am getting a new laptop to replace my two-month old laptop .
Being virus-resistant is a huge plus .
Seriously considering a larger laptop to replace the Dell
I was a little worry at first because I do n't have a lot of experience with os.x and windows has always been second nature to me after many years of using windows .
I reinstalled windows through the recovery discs and everything seemed good again .
Asked the customer service rep.
But after using it a couple of weeks , the overall operation is poor .
I like it so much , I bought another just for my wife .
Just keep in mind the graphics is not dedicated so loading the movie almost took a minute , but it ran fairly smooth for a non-dedicated graphics card .
Was very much worth the price i paid .
You can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy o boy does it ever .
Although I opted for the lowest end MacBook Pro , this thing holds its own .
NOW AM VERY APREHENSIVE ABOUT TOSHIBA LAPTOPS .
Dismantle the whole thing ? Then it will not be a newly manufactured set like before .
To this day , there are NONE .
Compared to similarly spec 'd PCs , this machine is good value , well built and works easily right out of the box .
This is by far thee best , most reliable computer I could find .
It 's the inside that is truly wonderful .
It looks and feels solid , with a flawless finish .
just chill and enjoy .
Another Great thing is the Beast graphics .
Oh , boy !
since then i have had minor problems with slow operation .
The memory was gone and it was not able to be used .
So glad I have gone this route !!
still testing the battery life as i thought it would be better , but am very happy with the upgrade .
I can see why the have soooo much money .
Web surfuring is smooth and seamless .
Taking it anywhere was a pain !
Its everything mac offers .
The gray color was a good choice .
The 17 inch screen is very large , but the computer is very light .
HUGE Apple MAC Fan !
Very disappointed !
I have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing .
The battery lasts as advertised ( give or take 15-20 minutes ) , and the entire user experience is very elegant .
Now the screen is going darker , darker , darker .
As far as user type - I dabble in everything from games ( WoW ) to Photoshop , but nothing professionally .
Very dissappointed becase I have had toshibas for years , and never a issue .
I bought this MacBook Pro to replace my six-year-old PC ( a Sony Vaio ) , but it was basically no better than my old PC , so I returned it .
This machine rocks !
Windows 7 Starter is terrific ( no you ca n't change the background ) but I do n't need to , I use it just for school work .
I worked in IT retail sales before .
Great battery , speed , display .
It would not let me connect to my Wifi system where I lived .
It was slow , locked up , and also had hardware replaced after only 2 months !
This was a gift for my grand son .
I have had a total of 5 different laptop from many different manufactures .
I also purchased Office Max 's " Max Assurance " with the " no lemon " clause .
This is the first time that I tried and owning a netbook although I have used 3 different laptops in the past 10 years , I find not much difference except of course for the screen size .
That is my only complaint !
Images can be multi-selected and viewed swiftly or in slideshow mode .
It makes a great gift .
My laptop now has no battery .
Besides , the apple stocks have been falling due to lack of sales .
We figure that after everything HIS pc actually ended up costing $ 350 more than my original Mac .
From the get-go , the M6809 was unsteady in its operation ;
And windows 7 works like a charm .
I 've always used PC 's for work home and this is my first experience with a Mac .
We paid for the three year warranty and the extended warranty after that one ended as well .
2 . The wireless card is low quality .
I loved the netbook ( minus the fact that it was windows OS ) until this started happening .
Got this for a graduation gift for my daughter for her to use at college .
It 's ok but does n't have a disk drive which I did n't know until after I bought it .
I love its solid build , light wt and excellent battery life ( for now ) .
its by far faster and more stable then my PC .
But Sony said we could send it back and be charged for adding the bluetooth an additional seventy something dollars .
Of course , for a student , weight is always an issue .
Battery is lasting about 6 hours as I am surfing the web on Sundays while checking football scores and watching funny Youtube videos .
Only other thing is that if you are using this for document creation Apple doesnt provide any kind of word processor ( such as works for windows ) , but iwork is cheap compared to office .
Good computer and fast .
Most of the large bags are for a 17 inch .
1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in .
Small and still VERY powerful .
I normally dont participate in reviews/surveys but this laptop has not given me any problems and hope to share my thoughts ...
I have had a Mac for 6 years and wo n't go back to PC .
I love to write and play with graphics and html programming and my new Toshiba works great on both !
Runs good and does the job , ca n't complain about that !
I was waiting for this model to be released since January , and have been holding off on buying a Macbook Pro until the new model came out .
iLife is easily compatible with Microsoft Office so you can send and receive files from a PC .
I bought a protector for my key pad and it works great : )
Some problems can be fixed if you purchase new software , but there is no guarentee .
I wanted something that had a new Intel Core processors and HDMI port so that we could hook it up directly to our TV .
They were great in handling this problem , and I 'm looking forward in purchasing additonal products from them in the future .
The perfect notebook ...
I love my Samsung TV and Galaxy S smartphone , but this Netbook was a very poor computer .
I had gotten this model for $ 1199.00 on my State 's tax-free weekend and had a $ 100 off coupon for a MacBook at the local BestBuy !
I should have checked this before I installed my applications .
its not bad just VERY VERY annoying .
HP Pavilion DV9000 Notebook PC When I first got this computer , it really rocked .
it has 3 usb ports , 1 sd memory card reader and an sd memory car expansion .
NOT WITH APPLE .
Even though the computer is larger they did not make the keyboard larger .
Not working = bad
This machine is A-mazing .
Macs are designed for the " frontal lobe challenged " people out there .
I just recently had to ship my laptop back to HP for repair .
Boot-up slowed significantly after all Windows updates were installed .
None of the techs at HP knew what they were doing .
* 6th week * - They are not responding to my emails asking when they expect to dispatch the new unit ...
I can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner .
I have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied .
So , I went back .
If you check you will find the same notebook with the above missing ports and a dual core AMD or Intel processor .
what an elegant , wonderful machine .
Runs Hot I thought we were paying for quality in our decision to buy an Apple product .
Which it did not have , only 3 USB 2 ports .
We love the size of the screen , although it is still lightweight and very easy to tote around .
The difference in the Apple keyboard from a PC 's keyboard took a bit of tim to get used to , but overall it 's worth it !
With Windows laptops a wireless mouse is an absolute must .
I was WRONG !
and then , a guy came out to serve me instead .
The Computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks .
I think part of the problem with this computer is Vista , yet I know Vista is n't the entire issue because my latest purchase was my Acer and it also has Vista ( I should have waited the few months to get the next operating system ) .
Easy to carry , can be taken anywhere , can be hooked up to printers , headsets .
I have no idea how to burn cd 's or to use the web cam , just for starters .
I now realize that my $ 900 would have been better spent on a Windows laptop .
I will be patient for few months .
I was loving this Netbook because it had an amazing screen and display and was small and light , but after 1 week it stopped openning web pages for me ( even after installing new browsers ) then eventually it just started giving me a blue screen and crashing everytime I booted it .
Sony , Acer , Dell , Packard Bell and Toshiba .
The flaws are , this computer is not for computer gamers because of the OS X.
They are wonderful , but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat .
The brand of iTunes has just become ingrained in our lexicon now , but keep in mind that Apple started it all .
This is a great machine !
The laptop is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the Windows 7 starter and not the full Windows 7 .
The processor screams , and because of the unique way that Apple OSX 16 functions , most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software .
Just be careful ; you always have to give up some good stuff for others .
Soft touch , anodized aluminum with laser cut precision and no flaws .
This is what they told me : It heats up , and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops , and simply categorize them as portables .
Took a long time trying to decide between one with retina display and one without .
It is the best all around Mac .
It crashes , and when it goes flat , it just DIES ( like a PC , maybe worse ) and I loose all my open documents !
Although i do believe that Windows operating system may be to fault for some of the problems .
But when I received my replacement , I made BOTH recovery DVDs ( 4 ) , and a driver/application DVD .
so i called technical support .
I hate it .
And these are some reasons you should get a macbook pro .
The difference is phenomenal .
Awesome laptop and the perfect size to carry around in college .
It meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling .
As a user of a PC , I will will admit that the macBook Pro has a better running system in which I found myself " Getting the job done quicker .
keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed .
It took me a while top get away from the land of PCs , but now that I have , I ca n't see myself going back to it .
I ordered four D620 laptops .
Seems to me that 's the best way to get Apple 's attention .
I remind myself from time to time to take off my watch when ever I look at the small scratch that it has caused .
This mac is great !
I think that if it is the motherboard again so soon that they should replace it .
If only Bill Gates would read some of what is said here MS would do a better job .
I love apple but unlike others That does not prevent me to not be honest about how i like it and if its good or not .
It has happened again and I 'm being told that it 's $ 175 .
With no problems , I 'm happy with this purchase because I saved money compared to buying it anywhere else .
Very happy .
Great wifi too .
i use my mac all the time , i love the software , the way it takes a short time to load things , how easy it is to use and most of all how you do n't have to worry about viruses .
I 'm hoping the rest of the features will be the signature quality of apple .
The 2.9 ghz dual-core i7 chip really out does itself .
* = Webcam is a bit laggy , not the greatest .
It 's A MAC !!
I highly recommend that you buy this product .
Remember to do your research first before consider buying a toshiba product .
What angers me more than anything else is that I spent all those years hating MACs when I could have been getting a lot more production with a whole lot less grief !
I called apple and no solution .
I thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer would n't go onto our wireless network and I would n't have the same problems because it was updated .
I 'm pretty sure it 's not newegg 's fault but when you turn on a computer you just bought you want it to at least get to desktop .
I have n't used it for anything high tech yet , but I love it already .
I fell in love with my machine , and it was pampered .
Came fully loaded - good .
Ok , this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by Apple .
They are closed at 9pm eastern .
I am also upset with CR for giving a good rating .
They say sorry out of warranty .
OSX Lion is a great performer . . extremely fast and reliable .
We have had numerous problems with Vista , such as Adobe Flash player just quits and has to be uninstalled and then reinsalled , Internet Explore just quits and you lose whatever you were working on , also , the same Windows update has appeared on this computer since we got it and has been updated probably 400 times , the same update .
I had this computer for one month and had to send it in for repair .
I would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front .
I really like the Mac 15.4 in . Notebook , but its very pricey .
This was an update from an early MacBook Pro .
Save your money and go for a better device .
I know Apples are more expensive than PCs , but he thinks it is worth every penny .
Words can not express how much I love my new Mac .
Graphics are clean and sharp , internet interfaces are seamless .
From the build quality to the performance , everything about it has been sub-par from what I would have expected from Apple .
I have had two Toshiba satellite computers and while they are okay , they are in no way comparable to the Mac .
, which Apple does n't offer , is why I bought my MacBook at Best Buy .
But , Mac makes the switch from PC to Mac easy .
I love the 15 " MacBook Pro .
The machine has a bluray player the book has no mention of it or how to connect it to your HDTV .
Waited on getting this computer , but it has been a great change .
I went to my local Best Buy looking for a new laptop since mine broke .
I thought learning the Mac OS would be hard , but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a PC .
And the fact that it comes with an i5 processor definitely speeds things up
There is hardly any memory on the computer 's hard drive .
Temperatures on the outside were alright but i did not track in Core Processing Unit temperatures .
Did I mention everything about it , from size to weight to keyboard screams BULK ?
Summary : After doing some investigation on the web , I have found that Toshiba NB205s are not chronically not booting .
All the things you can do with the trackpad make navigating around the computer and its programs so much simpler , quicker , and easier .
The paint wears off easily due to the keyboard being farther back than usual .
Overall a nice computer .
The So called laptop Runs to Slow and I hate it !
It 's software and speed enable it to do amazing things .
My laptop with Windows 7 crashed and I did not want Windows 8 .
It has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard !
After they found no other way , they told me to courier it to them ( since they do n't allow the use of the post office ) at my expense , and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it would n't be covered .
My smart phone is faster !
It 's priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box .
I would buy it again in a heartbeat !
IT IS TRASH !
Price and purpose is awesome !
it has times were it freezes for 10 seconds and then starts again .
English must have been his third or fourth language .
I stayed up half the night enjoying my new MacBook Pro .
While there are occasions that my computer will freeze or will need to be manually shut down , this occurs far less frequently than on PC computers and laptops that I 've used .
The feel of this is better than the Toshiba , too .
They are not .
They sent out a Sony ' Certified ' technician .
Now , I guess , I 'll have to unload my M6809 on some poor , hapless soul .
Battery life needs more life .
the mouse on the pad , the left button always sticks .
System is loosing about 20 % of performance because of that .
I wanted to explore what the Mac was all about .
The only downfall is a lot of the software I have wo n't work with Mac and iWork is not worth the price of it .
BEST BUY - 5 STARS + + + ( sales , service , respect for old men who are n't familiar with the technology ) DELL COMPUTERS - 3 stars DELL SUPPORT - owes a me a couple
Will certainly use MacConnection again .
A mac is very easy to use and it simply makes sense .
I was psyched .
There also seemed to be a problem with the hard disc as certain times windows loads but claims to not be able to find any drivers or files .
This is the third MacBook Pro in our family .
I love the operating system and the preloaded software .
If you had PC for four years I can almost gaurentee that something would of gone wrong by now , maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer .
Ever since I bought this laptop , so far I 've experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer services I received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines .
I am using the external speaker - sound is good .
It has easy to use features and all the speed and power I could ask for .
They should have included more memory on their computers if they knew Vista would run slowly .
So honestly , I was n't expecting anything less than perfection , and I was n't disappointed .
This one has had the same effect .
Very nice unibody construction .
What 's really great about this product is you may have a family member who is computer illiterate and you can pretty much just let them loose on this computer without any real supervision .
It can not save the correct date and time I set .
It 's fast at loading the internet .
I sent it back AND THEY LOST IT .
Tried to make a recovey disk wouldnt get passed the first recovery disk .
Unfortunately , that is not the case .
Bottom line , I doubt you 'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine .
I should have realized that trouble was brewing .
As it turns out , I just did n't know any better .
I bought mine from Apple Store the day it was released as Amazon did n't have it yet .
My son said it popped up and he clicked update .
i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus .
I 've installed to it additional SSD and 16Gb RAM .
Most laptops and notebooks are difficult to key on .
The ease in which you set everything up is such that a child could do it .
Even though I could have gotten a pc twice the speed for the same price I still think there 's nothing like a Mac .
sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move .
I bought the netbook because it was smaller and lighter for me to carry around .
It 's macbook pro and there is no discusion about it .
Finally , I should note that I took the 2GB RAM stick from my old EeePC and installed it before I even powered on for the first time .
Despite the plethora of problems , I managed to use technological trickery to keep the machine operational for two years .
It has a faster processor and more ram .
Not super light but still a good one .
If you want a little more custom ability , drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of Win 7 and grab a 2GB stick of memory to spice it all up a bit more .
It doesnt overheat or make any loud noises .
Price was higher when purchased on MAC when compared to price showing on PC when I bought this product .
I personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers .
My children wo n't even use it for their school work .
Added an iMac about 2 years later .
I 'm very happy with this machine !
No HDMI port .
This laptop looks great on the surface : 17 " inch screen , good price-point , nice appearance , boots up quickly , runs fast etc .
I purchased this laptop while on a business trip to keep up with my email .
The computer could have been shipped by Priority Mail through the USPS for the same cost and arrived by Noon on Tue .
I 'm going back to DELL .
After looking at all the pros and cons , I decided on the Macbook Pro .
But I do NOT like Win8 .
THIS LAPTOP WAS BAD FROM THE FIRST DAY OF USE ---- BROUGHT IT BACK TO STORE FOR RETURN OF MONEY .
It did fairly well , other than it 's poor performance , overheating and occational blue screen .
I just bought the new MacBook Pro , the 13 " model , and I ca n't believe Apple keeps making the same mistake with regard to USB ports .
For some odd reasons the computer does n't reconize the operation system .
I also got the added bonus of a 30 " HD Monitor , which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh !
This is the third in a series of MacBooks starting with a Black MacBook .
Stay away from Envy .
The resolution is even higher then any other laptop on the market .
I just took the broken cords into the Apple store and they gave me new ones .
The built in camera is very useful when chatting with other techs in remote buildings on our campus .
But the biggest pain is that tech support is not available 24/7 .
It is easy to use , its keyboard easily accommodates large hands , and its weight is fantasic .
It could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have DDR5 instead of DDR3 .
THEN , one month after the warranty expired , the replacement charger went .
i love the size of the computer since i play games on it .
It just works flawlessly !
Sorry , newegg .
I was disappointed when I realized that the keyboard does n't light up on this model .
It gives me the power and speed that I need to run all the programs I use to edit .
No machine has come remotely close to causing as many problems .
I do n't have that additional money right now , and therefore would n't have purchased it at this time .
The benefits were immediate !
Where you click and hold and drag it picture , link , etc to where you want it .
Also , I have had alot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines .
I would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about .
I was also able to install and use my Photoshop and AfterEffects programs easily .
Bought it to use mostly for oline classes .
I find it not to be very user friendly .
I bought it for college and so far it 's amazing !
It WORKS !
Well , I started using Google Chrome , which is a little better , but it freezes too sometimes .
The ease of set up was terrific .
My last laptop gave me a constant battle even though it was also completely new .
It is very durable , I am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet .
It came before the day it supposed to which is great .
The Mac Mini is probably the simplest example of compact computing out there .
NO STAR FOR THIS TRASH . [ ...
I never have had a good result with this computer .
They don t translate from a Mac , even on Word , resulting in a ton of run-on sentences .
I purchased this laptop 9 months ago !
Yeah , to you .
The computer will constantly be getting hot and burning your leg unless you go through the hassle of taking off the entire back of it just to clean out the fan .
I was given a demonstration of Windows 8 .
Luckily , Dell said they would replace my laptop with a new one , but instead I got a refund and bought a mac .
I actually had the hard drive replaced twice , the mother board once , the dvd drive twice , then they FINALLY agreed to replace it , ( ALL OF THIS IN LESS THAN 1 1/2 YEARS !
The one thing I wish it had was a detailed hardcopy manuel .
with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch .
Page just disapeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something .
The neat and organized icon list is a welcome change from cluttered and confusing desktop icons .
Bigger HD , better graphics card , and a bid HD .
The laptop is relatively simple to use , though I bought Macs for Dummies , which is well worth $ 2
It doesnt get hot like my PC , with technology always at the tip of our fingertips anytime I forget how to do something i just google it .
I ve had several calls lasting more than an hour with promises to call back , but the return calls never came .
) I also purchased Applecare for $ 300 , which is a three year extended warranty , since I ve never seen any laptop that lasted more than two .
I have to wonder why Amazon is even selling this dinosaur .
I 'm Not exagerating when I say this computer is perfect . . i It is !!
I use it mostly for content creation ( Audio , video , photo editing ) and its reliable .
I 've always owned a PC and decided to try a MacBook to see what it 's all about .
After 20-30 min the screen of the notebook switched off .
Best Buy ended up junking the computer and giving me a replacement computer .
this laptop is durable and it is easy to travel with .
That 's very possible , but since they do n't make Windows XP drivers for the sound card in this machine , I was stuck until Windows 7 came out .
After way too many times sending the thing in for repairs ( delivery service was slow , and without the laptop I had no access to the internet , and thus no way of tracking it to find out when I might hope to see my computer again ) , it finally kicked the bucket after just over 2 years .
Amazing Quality !
Summary : HP knew they were shipping out bad BIOS and did nothing proactive to resolve it .
They break down just as often as PCs do , and the only reason they do n't get viruses , is because no one makes viruses for them , they 're not better in any way , they are worse , try finding virus protection programs for a Mac , they do n't exist .
( If you ever see the spinning beachball come up when you think it should n't , check the " Activity Monitor " app to see if the disk throughput has temporarily dropped to zero .
It 's A MAC !!
for 2 months .
One night I turned the freaking thing off after using it , the next day I turn it on , no GUI , screen all dark , power light steady , hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does .
Other Thoughts : I love newegg , I recommend them to the world however this is just unacceptable .
The battery life is also relatively good .
Could n't have asked for more !
Very good quality and well made .
i FINALLY DID IT AND THIS MACHINE IS THE WAY TO GO !
The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box , all the functions works great .
the mcbook pro notebook will make it easy for you to write and read your emails at blazing speeds .
Mac is not made for gaming .
Sadly Apple has discontinued this MacBook , I think it was never super popular since it fell somewhere in between the cheapest white model and the smaller Pros .
The pictures are clear as can be .
It super shiny , so you can see the fingerprints easily .
They did n't even try to assist me or even offer a replacement .
I had the staff telling me older version did not make the fan noise cause it is a " different " computer .
I bought this one for my 11 year old and the MacBook Air for my 9 year old .
When this happened I would have to completely power off my computer and restart it .
I went with him and we picked this one .
It has worked fine .
I found the mini to be : Exceptionally easy to set up
Call tech support , standard email the form and fax it back in to us .
It is so speedy .
Runs real quick .
I bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market .
Setting would change for some reason , the screen size would change on it 's own , like the pixel sizes and whatnot .
No temporary replacement , they are out of replacements because " many computers had problems with the Nvidia chipset " - Inquired status of repair .
I had less problems .
No laptop is perfect , but sometimes you just find a computer that works for you .
I have the A65 - right now it 's a paperweight .
All the programs are easy and straight forward on my MacBook Pro , it is clean and organized , which I always strive to be myself .
I am able to play 720p and 1080p media files just fine with it .
this one , in my opinion , might be a lemon !
PDF files can be viewed instantly .
without having to have extra equipment and/or complicated routes to take to be able to do so .
I am now making a point to avoid their products and I hope my experience can serve as a warning to you as well .
Other Thoughts : Received replacement 16 Days later .
My ONLY issues are : 1 ) the screen/video resolution wo n't increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60
I also wanted Windows 7 , which this one has .
This is my first personal Satellite purchase but had very good experience through previous Satellite work issued laptops .
The sheer power and flexibility makes the MacBook Pro a must have for any techie !
Plus two finger clicking as a replacement for the right click button is surprisingly intuitive .
It 's great for streaming video and other entertainment uses .
Laptop is to be used like a Netbook .
This version of MacBook Pro runs on a third-generation CPU ( " Ivy Bridge " ) , not the latest fourth-generation Haswell CPU the 2013 version has .
Also , because of the size and consistancy of the laptop computer , some websites would n't even attempt to work on the computer because of browser problems .
My favorite by far , although the most expensive , was my Sony .
I was n't really sure I wanted to spend that kind of money !
The only thing I miss is that my old Alienware laptop had backlit keys .
* 3 weeks after giving the computer for repair * - Visited MacHouse Amsterdam .
What a mistake !
I Have been a Pc user for a very long time now but I will get used to this new OS .
It was wonderful deal for the wonderful product .
I have owned macbook pros since 2005 and this is the best yet !
The computer was delivered as promised .
It is also very lightweight , making transporting this computer very easy .
Very Very Highly Recommended .
I was considering buying the Air , but in reality , this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient , even though it 's about .20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier .
I consider myself an average user and this computer serves my need .
The best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once , it never slows down .
This machine delivers .
Trashed it when I spilled a latte on it while writing at a cafe .
4gb of ram ...
this is my second one and the same problem , bad video card unreliable overall , this will be my second time returning this laptop back to best buy .
I Have a friend who has the other model and we put them side by side with the same dvd in ( battle of the Smithsonian ) After on Hour mine was at 53 % life left and his was at 69 % life left .
I wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month .
It was getting old and I needed a new school computer .
The MacBook Pro is a great product which can meet the needs of the average consumer .
The iLife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product .
The cons are more annoyances that can be lived with .
It is sleek , smooth , and lightweight .
- No backlit keyboard , but not an issue for me .
Do not purchase this laptop .
This was around three years , maybe four years ago .
The display is beyond horrible .
My life has been enriched since I have been using Apple products .
But I was completely wrong , this computer is UNBELIEVABLE amazing and easy to use .
I am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook , it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop .
power supply went bad after 2 weeks --
The display is incredibly bright , much brighter than my PowerBook and very crisp .
They offer the best warranty in the business , and do n't 3rd party it out like Toshiba .
My sisters same laptop broke about the month later for the same reason .
There is no number pad to the right of the keyboard which is a bummer .
Keys stick periodically and I havent had the laptop for 45 days yet .
I WILL NEVER AGAIN buy another Acer , not will I buy Gateway , or eMachine as they are all from the same company .
the retina display display make pictures i took years ago jaw dropping .
I can have both OSX and Windows XP running at the same time !
Which is great I am running Vista Business and scored a 5.X on the index I have never seen a windows machine have a total score in the 5 's .
It was heavy , bulky , and hard to carry because of the size .
This was my first MacBook purchase ever .
Sure it 's not light and slim but the features make up for it 100 % .
The resolution on the screen is almost pure HD .
I love this piece of equipment , It will be hard to go back to other type of laptop after using a MacBook Pro .
I am totally satisfied with my little toshie !
The only solution is to turn the brightness down , etc .
Many people complain about the new OS , and it 's urgent for Apple to fix it asap !
That was my first Apple product and since then I have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs I have bought .
This is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine ;
Maybe this is virus related , maybe not , but the computer has locked up many times , and on two occasions , the screen has simply gone black .
My husband uses it mostly for games , email and music .
Fan noise : The fan made a constant hissing noise in the background .
All of the programs ( Keynote , Pages , Numbers ) have an option to save your documents as Microsoft compatible , which really eliminates the need for the actual .
The screen is bright and clear , the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice .
It did n't take me long to get switched over to the Mac computer programs and navigation - it 's been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better .
I bought this laptop for my son in 2007 for his Christmas present .
The applications are also very easy to find and maneuver , much easier than any other computer I have ever owned .
His was worth $ 36 .
I could n't be more pleased .
The computer continued to give me issues and in Late June it completely died again and I tried to call Acer again to get it fixed and they refused to help me , they said my warrenty was up and hung up on me .
The apple systems are over priced luxurys that ar n't worth what they are being charged for , this model 's specifications are far from being impressive and they only thing you get out of this is the apple name .
I love it !
Recently there are a few incidents that annoy the hell out of me .
USB3 Peripherals are noticably less expensive than the ThunderBolt ones .
It is robust , with a friendly use as all Apple products .
As usual at customer service center , she asked me to hold for a moment while she went to the back-office and compare it with other same model netbooks and discussed it with her colleague ( I could see them ) .
Reason why ? It 's because when you buy it , you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that laptop , the price will stay the same for the next year , and even if Apple does decides to change mode , your laptop value will only drop 10-20 % , unlike PC laptops which drop more than 80 % .
It is fast and i have not had a problem with internet connection or any other problems .
They told me it was my loss even though it was the computer , not what I 've done .
The only downfall is the battery only last 1.5-2 .0 hrs when not plugged in .
The only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets , and rather quickly too .
I have been PC for years but this computer is intuitive and its built in features are a great help
I would definitely suggest this laptop !
Waiting for the i7 was well worth it , great value for the price .
But with A WAY Bigger Screen , and IS able to connect to an HDMI .
This machine was a horrible experience .
For my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin ( it happened 7 months ago ) they offered me an ITouch 8Gig ( you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich , offer a loyal customer like me , a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this ) .
I do n't have stupid pop up windows ( even when I have pop ups blocked ) , I do n't have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download , and best of all I can run all the web programming software I need to use all at once without slowing me down .
I was a little concerned about the touch pad based on reviews , but I 've found it fine to work with .
Wonderful sleek case design is only on the outside .
I had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity , because it is very sensitive .
The performance seems quite good , and built-in applications like iPhoto work great with my phone and camera .
When I finally had everything running with all my software installed I plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed .
I respond that I do not have the old computer ...
This computer is absolutely AMAZING !!!
It is held in place magnetically .
However , there are MAJOR issues with the touchpad which render the device nearly useless .
Asus facial recognition does n't work and windows logon is n't either .
The first programm I switched on was a game for my children .
The battery life sucked the juice from my laptop and when the extended life battery went out we were SOL there to , so much for that warranty covering all the products we purchased .
It is extremely fast and very compact .
I had to return it because it would n't even start .
This is perfect for her field .
Battery life could be better but overall for the price and Toshiba 's reputation for laptops it 's great !
Excellent LED monitor and well equipped .
The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months , stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes .
The Final Cut Pro on this laptop is so fast and easy , and I can use this to seemlessly transfer all my work to my home computer , which is also a mac .
BUT there 's this application called Boot Camp which allows you to add another OS X like Windows .
The pricing is very competitive .
YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TALK TO AN AMERICAN WARRANTY SERVICE IS OUT OF COUNTRY .
The battery gets so HOT it is scary .
I am ADDICTED to photo booth !
the volume is really low to low for a laptopwas not expectin t volume to be so lowan i hate that about this computer
It still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there .
But the quality , in general was less than the worth of the cheap laptop .
The notebook is lacking a HDMI port and a S-video port that would enable one to hook it to a TV .
So when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand .
Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another , and I am not kidding you , I called different hours of the day and you 'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again , since they make it sound like they do n't have your history list of your calls right in front of them .
The mousepad is a huge pain in the arse !
That was a big mistake .
After purchasing this thing , I find out that I need a special interface device to connect my camera , and that it can not be purchased at the store - only on line .
I would recommend this computer to anyone searching for the perfect laptop , and the battery life is amazing .
Within 3 weeks the same issues started happening AGAIN .
Or the cursor would show up some place else .
Acer was no help and Garmin could not determine the problem ( after spending about 2 hours with me ) , so I returned it and purchased a Toshiba R700 that seems even nicer and I was able to load all of my software with no problem .
That included the extra Sony Sonic Stage software , the speakers and the subwoofer I got ( that WAS worth the money ) , the bluetooth mouse for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer , the extended life battery and the Docking port .
I have had a black macbook since 2007 .
so when I had the money to buy one I bought other things instead .... a 700 laptop and some extra stuff with it .
If a website ever freezes ( which is rare ) , its really easy to force quit .
- got it back 3 months later
Logic board utterly fried , cried , and laid down and died .
Still , this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work .
I do n't know why I did n't make the switch sooner ... o ya because it 's expensive .
The receiver was full of superlatives for the quality and performance .
I charge it at night and skip taking the cord with me because of the good battery life .
So , I must say I am not a happy camper .
Even if Apple replaces whatever needs replacing I wonder if , since I seem to be doubling the amount of time I get out of it each time it 's " like new , " I might have 8 months next time .
I 'M REALLY FRUSTRATED BY THIS EXPERIENCE .
Small enough to use on a long flight , Light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips .
I 've had my Macbook Pro since August 2009 .
This was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped .
I sit down and use my husband 's work PC and I do n't like it one bit .
Never any doubt I would get a MacBook , just was n't sure which one .
However , the experience was great since the OS does not become unstable and the application will simply shutdown and reopen .
I love how easy every thing is to do on my Apple products .
I was very excited because this was my first personal computer and I was purchasing it with my OWN money I had recieved from graduation presents .
The Macbook is also made better , my computer has never got a virus , and the laptop runs just as fast as the first day I bought it .
The right speaker did not work .
Laptop is advertised as a 15 " but the casing looks like that of a 17 " .
My computer was one of the best in the school compared to my fellow classmates .
Apple hit a home run here .
It is everything that I would want in a computer .
Fits all my personal needs .
My last laptop was a 17 " ASUS gaming machine , which performed admirably , but having since built my own desktop and really settling into the college life , I found myself wanting something smaller and less cumbersome , not to mention that the ASUS had been slowly developing problems ever since I bought it about 4 years ago .
the apple pro notebook will not let you down .
I could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat .
I have had several machines over the years , both for personal and business use .
the speed is fine .
As with any laptop not purchased with software options , it comes with a lot of what I consider useless applications .
Love the stability of the Mac software and operating system .
Pretty much made sense to get a Mini .
the only problem is that i had to add 1 gb RAM , the computer was kinda slow .
I will not be using that slot again .
It played various games without problems and ran aero smoothly and flawlessly .
The only bad part is the size/weight .
The screen resolution was exactly what I was looking for .
i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have .
Very long-life battery ( up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings ) .
Once I removed all the software the laptop loads in 15-20 seconds .
I hope to edit this in the next few hours , I am going to try to install my own copy of Windows 7 .
It will be returned in the state to which it was shipped Michigan .
I do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it , however I would highly suggest purchasing a stand however , due to the nature of the design of the macbook as it is one very large heat sink .
The durability of the laptop will make it worth the money .
Again .
I am a wife , mom and a school teacher and a college student .
May be better for the occasional web surfer .
Great product , very easy to use and great graphics .
When I called Sony the Customer Service was Great .
And if you do a lot of writing , editing is a problem since there is no forward delete key .
Also , macbooks come with much more features which are so cool !
I will stack it up against laptops that cost twice as much any day .
Also the display is exceptional !
I spoke with a service rep at Micro Center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her power adapter , so it 's not just an isolated incident !!!
I am a college student and it has been very useful .
Was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba ? Probably not ever again .
In my line of work , I often have to take work home , and this makes it so easy .
As well as having the plug in the computer come loose .
You will fall in love with it in no time .
even though I had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty .
I homeschool my kids and with this netbook next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat .
After about another month I had to send it in AGAIN to Acer for repairs .
I 'm tired of the inept service .
It is very user friendly and not hard to figure out at all .
The price is great for this model , I only plan on using it for media in the entertainment room .
Then the system would many times not power down without a forced power-off .
I bought it from HSN because it was " bundled " with extra software , but as it turns out , that software just crashes it more often .....
But , like I said before , the only reason I do n't currently have a Mac laptop is because all of their laptops are too pricey .
This is why I purchased a BRAND NEW LAPTOP in the first place so it would n't have ANY problems .
The only thing I would change about it is the mouse keys .
I do n't use my laptop in a way though that needs a long battery life so it 's perfect for me .
Because he said that the hinge is under the motherboard and they have to dismantle the whole thing before it can be tightened .
What a waste of time it was to run a Defrag on the PC !
All the above aside this machine ROCKS !
The Unibody construction is solid , sleek and beautiful .
Unfortunately , Apple 's quality has continued to slide .
It is easy to use , good quality and good price .
The keyboard , which generally felt okay even for someone used to a desktop keyboard , now looks terrible .
I looked at the computer and it said updating but the asked for a product key .
I have had it for almost four years now and I have only had a few problems with it .
three years is a decent life , but this must make it to graduation and beyond .
The sound is a bit quiet if you 're on a plane , this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones .
