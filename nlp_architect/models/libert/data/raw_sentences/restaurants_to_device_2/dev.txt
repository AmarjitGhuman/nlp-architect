had to buy my dad a different dvd player locally ( panasonic ) which worked just fine .
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .
the service from t-mobile is very good too .
the phones are awesome .
after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support .
i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones .
that makes sense though , with all the substandard products they make .
you should too .
and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs .
the 20 gig ipod still goes for just under $ 400 .
+ screen was good , easy to read
otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
- very long-lasting battery life
song transfers were not an issue .
i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .
difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say " difficult , " but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate .
charged my battery .
and then it breaks .
a card with more memory is a must .
my story is based on personal usage .
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .
but for now this will do .
pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
the sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with .
worth every penny !
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .
i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic .
the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .
two days later the phone was returned to me in complete working order .
i 've had it for a week now , do n't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it .
software - the software is crap .
so far we have only hooked up one of them .
after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available .
in addition , you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player .
2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .
unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .
i am not associated with the company , i am not providing a url , but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily .
as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine .
of course you do !
even if there happened to be identical track titles on the same disc , you could still edit the file name manually and get them both onto the player .
zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .
like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .
i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable ( 49.99 @ nokiausa.com or t-mobile.com ) press dial up on my laptop ( by the way it is a mac pb 1gz. and in a matter of seconds i can access my email , fax , and the entire web from my truck !
now , even 1 star seems like i 'm giving creative the benefit of the doubt .
i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures .
btw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information .
the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .
if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .
yes , i have red-eye off , and yes , i 've tried adding a flash .
rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
i do n't think i will ever use the full 30gb .
this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap .
the software , mediasource , cannot work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) .
for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .
one major complaint :
the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck .
it 's nothing major , just a bad hard drive , any hard drive mp3 player can have that problem .
it can get pretty lonely out there .
+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .
in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .
it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice .
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e. , mp3s ) .
almost there .
i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .
i 'll just say this .. .
that takes up half the space of mp3 's .
the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .
battery life :
i really have no complaints over this unit .
if it had the same number of " ? " s then it would ask if you want to overwrite another song that just had the same number of " ? " s. . .
it is easy to " focus " in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .
i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com .
i purchased it at a retail store , and got an extended warranty .
- since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera .
first of all , many actions that the player utilizes do n't make sense . .
as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale .
what a mistake !
excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
i did n't even try the included software .
it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice .
so then i came across the ipod ( 10 gb ) .
the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .
first let me give you the bad things :
synchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized .
i also registered the unit online and posted two messages to the apex support person ( there can 't possibly be more than one !
the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .
from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .
you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .
if you have the money and need 40 gb , this is the player for you .
make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !
that is a major minus , but its not that bad .
the price compared to the ipod is great .
here are the pros and cons ( few there are ) in detail :
the zen has no stop button .
when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .
also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .
it 's worth it .
sometimes when i get really lonely , i like to put on some kenny g and light some candles , and while this does n't help , i am a capitalist pig and like buying things too , nah mean ! ?
for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience .
the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use .
i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing .
for once , though , this 3rd party software is excellent .
3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything .
i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :
and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
recently i accidently washed my telephone with my laundry through two complete 18 minute wash cycles of a washing machine .
just be aware of it .
i was told that it is no longer available , so there must be something really wrong with it .
a remote would have been cool too ... but lets not push it .
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there .
before i " get used to it " , here are my first feelings :
if the music had been on my home computer , the transfer would have been accomplished very quickly .
unless your a professional , now you will need only one camera . this one .
12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !
thought i 'd weigh in here with my stats .
the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .
this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .
m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !
also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .
be advised , however , that you may encounter problems .
you can also create your own if you do n't like their classifications .
i upgraded to a 6610 at my local t-mobile store .
the most important thing for me is sound quality .
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player .
no go on most formats .
i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .
you do take your chances with this phone .
i recently bought this after my archos 20 multimedia self-destructed ( do n't get me started on that piece of junk ! ) and expected it to be flawless .
2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )
2 ) scroll button / switch
i did buy separate headphones as other have recommended .
overall i like the unit .
this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !
it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .
either way , can 't go wrong with this price .
i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra .
this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .
replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 .
i have n't used any of them since i got the g3 .
it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system .
ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras .
i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .
i 've tried draining it until it wo n't turn on & recharging it overnight .
in a quick summation , here is what i found .
if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you .
it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .
the speakerphone :
my only significant complaint is sound quality .
i had hoped this was bought from walmart so that i could return it !
you discover this later when you 're listening to a song and it 's the wrong title , causing you to rename everything on your own .
one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .
5 two different adapters -- ur-e 4 and ur-e 7 -- are required for some attachment lenses .
i am surprised amazon still carries this after all of the continued problems .
i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow !
as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .
the entire unit was poorly crafted .
it focuses in a snap .
finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy .
but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck .
yes , the features are numerous .
dim or bright , it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out , after the tae kwon do kick broke the board .
i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it .
this thing , while looking pretty cool , is not as sexy as the ipod .
basic shipping was a bit slow , but that 's okay .
( did i mention you can actually change the battery ? hello ? apple ? are you listening ? )
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) .
i doubt i will use half of the storage capacity , but you never know .
you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .
four megapixels is great .
could not stop it , could not get out of the " now playing " screen .
2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
i wish i could give negative stars !
bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better .
unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it .
this is quite simply the best you can ask for .
the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .
size and style :
i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) .
the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .
all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .
i tried re-setting it , i tried just about every pair of headphones in my house ( 10 pairs ) , and nothing worked .
in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries .
in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .
so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .
3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust .
i am very pleased with its quality and durability .
headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .
lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .
learning how to use it will not take very long .
it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory ( smaller / lighter ) and the 30gb uses a hard drive .
we also looked at the fuji fps602 .
i can 't imagine why i would spend hundreds of dollars more to have an ipod .
it is small .
i ended up sending the unit back to amazon .
i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) .
i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .
as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .
after looking over multiple large mp3 players , i decided to get this one .
2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .
i 've bought the very expensive sanyo 5500/vm4500 -- which i love -- and i 'm okay with my services .
now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos .
this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi .
apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .
a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop
although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint .
karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity .
well to say , i had a very bad history with players .
the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla .
so if you use your card reader ; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date ; time .
i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had .
who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will .
we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working .
i will never purchase anything from this company ever again and have logged my complaint with the bbb .
being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 .
so .. .
but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose .
and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player.for the first three hours , and then it died .
they told me i would have to connect to my laptop , which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email .
i guess you get what you pay for .
the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .
it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .
i intend to contact the company , but from what i 've read .
i ordered 2 .
it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves .
i will say this .
it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .
with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet .
despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography .
i ordered this player for christmas , and so far i have it for only 2 weeks .
this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .
the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine .
the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera , which i do agree .
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .
i transfered all 16 gigs in 15 minutes without any errors via firewire .
moreover , they want a total of $ 107 to repair it .
it only took me about 10 seconds to transfer a 200mb file .
the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .
the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .
only the cheap and poor would buy one .
nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .
so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one .
so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .
it also covers over the power jack when closed .
definetely a great camera .
" check out " !
as soon as i lifted the unit out of the box , i questioned my judgement .
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera .
after receiving the box from amazon , i proceeded with charging the unit for the specified 4 hours , after which i installed the software and connected the unit to my pc via usb 2.0 .
i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time .
this is the third apex dvd i bought .
btw , be sure to have your mp3 tags labled correctly , as this will ensure a great organization .
in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .
audio on video also lacking .
3 ) folders cannot be created for the audio files .
mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them .
you see , i can 't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product .
now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it !
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad .
i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move .
also , the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with .
very cheaply made .
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !
i have not used the progressive scan feature .
being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .
i bought an ipod and am very happy with it .
pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry .
this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .
i purchased this as a christmas gift on 12-4 - 03 .
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera ..
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .
bait and switch .
these are minor problems , and i list them to save anyone else the trouble of discovering them .
one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like .
i highly recommend the accessory kit , which provides you with everything else you need :
i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .
then you can say , " my dissapointment only cost $ 39 . "
the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .
nokia has definitely won me over with this one .
mixed bag i guess but the price was right .
after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. .
no matter the format .
1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .
getting files onto it is quick and painless .
the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
if you 're a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rock-bottom price , i highly recommend this model .
it took over 2 months and repeated follow-up to get it replaced .
i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular .
if you watch dvds once in a while like i do , get this !
got it for christmas , still learning a few of the settings , but i do n't take pictures every single day .
a $ 300 device and they skimped on the headphone jack ?
it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video .
i made the mistake of thinking i could easily manage my mp3 library with this device .
i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any product ) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes .
i 've owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all , access speed .
the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance .
i did already have mediasource installed due to owning the creative audigy 2 soundcard but i did need to re-install it from the supplied cd as the older version did not have the connector to the zen .
this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags , and if you 've downloaded your songs off the internet , many probably do n't .
whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox , it dumps all of them into a single folder , and then sorts them by the id3 tags.
the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc.
there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !
maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .
i applied a $ 25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying $ 29 for this machine .
proven canon built quality and lens .
with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet .
with our compact 35mm broken , and a vacation in europe at hand , i finally decided to enter the digital age .
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .
3 battery has to be removed to recharge .
you could have paid more and got a lot less .
other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .
before jumping on the ipod train , take a look at this marvel .
i bought this for my dad for christmas .
3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze .
i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed .
first there 's the unit itself .
well , anyway i could go on and on on why this player did n't meet my expectations .. .
this is the best phone i have seen .
the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing .
thanks for nothing , amazon !
there was no distortion and it sounded great , especially with eax environmental audio enabled .
use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run .
you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . )
the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number .
nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .
it has never worked .
also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore " the " when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .
i 'm not sure if it would survive a fall from 3 feet .
i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .
3 ) you must press the play button and hold it for a couple of seconds otherwise it will not work and you will think the whole unit is broken .
so much packed in a small case and very affordable !
its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .
seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .
the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .
every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone .
but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .
and since i 'm out here i can 't mail it back under my 90 days and they wo n't help me out cause they say that the conditions here are not covered under the warranty .
keeps coming up with no disk errors .
now we come to the zen xtra .. .
the built-in camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff .
usability ( button usage , feature selection , menu structure , display size and quality ) also has good feedback .
but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle .
anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it .
my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months .
so i do n't understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them .
weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] .
here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :
not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .
great colors , pictures and white balance .
one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .
it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .
based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal .
they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it .
sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !
the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !
none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers - you cannot make changes on the ipod that are premanent .
you are not able to simply import files , but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them .
yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .
with the nomad explorer software , songs should be drag-and-drop .
the only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow , leading to longer delays in some functions ( playback and even a slow display of the menu ? ) .
i also own an " apex ad 1201 " dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 1/2 years ago .
this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .
for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button , a ring around the enter / play button .
maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again .
the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .
i simply love this feature .
i only have one question , when i add tracks to my nomad , via nomad explorer , they are automatically put in alphebetical order , rather than album order .
i set the camera to the " manual " mode for one main reason :
guess where this unit is headed ?
but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback .. . i can 't recommend this product .
but the major problem i had was with the software .
in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .
2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .
this one was rated very high by several people check out this site and epinions.com .
excellent range of metering options as well .
advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .
best regards sadoun satellite sales
is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ?
i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media .
i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit .
i received this as a gift .
i love the eos based controls and easy menus .
the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .
1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .
other than that this thing is great ...
it is not perfect though .
i am back to using # 1 .
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par .
sold in other parts of the world :
i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer , and then transfer them to a friend 's .
i used it lightly , and it lasted just over one year ( forgot to kill the power one day , and now it only plays dvds ).
1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office .
it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to " get into " it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .
i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery , so it 's good to go on a long vacation .
p.s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ?
i would suspect that there are similar problems with all of the other brands as this is somewhat new technology .
from there , you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player ( with the help of the media sniffer .. . read the manual ).
the cd will be classified into a number of genres , and in multidisk sets , you can get separate classifications for different disks by the same artist and the same performance .
a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included .
2 ) buy a good pair of head-phones unless you already own one .
i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great .
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough .
my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .
i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering .
while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .
for most people , they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection .
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files .
first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .
the higher the number the better the quality ( less data compression is used ) and the larger the file size .
for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .
i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged .
after reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common .
i will never use all the " whistles and bells " this machine is capable of .
apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r/rw and another supports - r/rw ) .
maybe i 'll get lucky with the next one .
size and weight :
* price and capacity
so far the software for the pc works easily .
prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture .
i purchased this phone after having been an at &#38; t subscriber with a nokia 8260 phone for over three years .
i guess i 'm just lucky to get a good working unit !
poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .
3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .
i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response .
because once the moment is gone , it is not coming back .
the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .
here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far :
after i went through the transer issue , i returned the zen xtra and purchased the 40 gig ipod .
i am even a bit technology oriented , so i thought it would be a breeze to set this up .
whatever you do , do n't buy this product .
i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond .
it was not my first choice .
i should n't have been cheap , should have bought a toshiba .
the g2 was better in this respect .
i first bought a 6 gig nomad jukebox ( original ).
worse of all , they claim that it 's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty !
audio is excellent .
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate .
compusa , memorex , fuji .
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
advertising pays off i guess .. .
i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem .
the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .
got a " system error " problem 30 days after purchase .
i did have some problems figuring out how to turn the unit on , but creative did a good job with this , as they had a clearly labled " on " button that i found when i left my cellar for the first time in years .
the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .
uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .
i was cruising around the device within 20 minutes .
although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
well , it was nice while it lasted .
i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion .
i would recogmend this player to anyone i know , and you will not be dissapointed .
comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .
it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output .
battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .
3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .
this is my first digital camera .
the downside -
i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with " bass boost . "
amazon.com promptly refunded my money for the first one , because a replacement was not available ( thanks amazon.com !
note : about 2gb ( 5 % ) of the advertised 40gb of storage capacity is used for the operating software ( firmware ) .
i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .
on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .
the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras .
also , they 'd forgotten to add " wap " capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out .
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .
it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .
sent mine back .
i made an additional five attempts at creating a playlist , before packing the unit up and heading over to amazon 's product return page .
recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony .
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture .
a tons of reveiws has reported this problem and the same here .
in manual , you can set it to " single af " where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features .
at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .
the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .
this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler .
it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine .
i have not yet tried the cd-ripping program .
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .
choosing zennx is a no-brainer when factoring in the cost of a new $ 400 + ipod every few years versus the $ 50 cost of replacing zennx 's rechargeable battery .
the dvd played without flaw through the chapter in question .
i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out .
i chose the canon speedlite 420 .
i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily .
extremely convenient .
one thing i should note is that i have only had this product for one day , so there are many options i have not explored .
the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .
this thing is trash .
one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .
i would not give up this phone for the world .
cleaned the dvd , tried again , no luck .
canon 's g3 does it consistently .
or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe .
great quality picture and features .
so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty !
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .
lastly , you cannot manage anything on the ipod itself .
it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .
the software is great .
awful , awful , awful .
i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .
but there are faceplates to replace it i guess ...
i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well .
when i first purchased the unit i downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website .
the other company is currently " out of stock " so i ordered another from amazon and will be taking the original back to the competitor today .
sometimes you skip past things or have to press it twice to select items .
ability to play most discs - i tried dvd , vcd , dvd-r , audio cd and it played all
the longest that i have n't charged it was maybe 3 days and that 's turning it off every now and then .
so far , however , i 'm a very happy customer .
buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever .
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .
i will just say this :
2 ) storage capacity
as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .
i agree with previous posts that you get what you pay for .
if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .
subsequent behavior even worse .
the only drawbacks that i have noticed :
the battery is nice .
overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it .
the pc quickly picked up on it and attempted to install the software , which failed , as creative chose not to follow microsoft standards , whatever .
their customer service is very poor .
silverish color really adds a special touch .
it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .
best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .
now , i thought it 's time to upgrade .
it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .
the dvd player just would't recognize them .
scroll bar :
the pictures are amazing .
the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .
and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality .
having said that , this is what you do . " add to cart " !
- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .
i do hope that they offer more faceplate options .
the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's " notmad " software because of some advanced features i wanted .
flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .
i doubt anyone has ever seen an add or commercial for any other mp3 player .
the included earbuds were uncomfortable .uncomfortable -1
if you purchase this product , definitely rip your songs through windows media player .
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
i 've gotten used to it ( holding it in just the right realation to the ear , ducking into quieter places in bars ) but when others borrow it they 're shocked i can use it .
for three months , i 've researched the internet and magazines , queried various sales personnel , and took hands-on in-store test drives .
do n't waste your money .
overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .
they take excellent macro shots as well .
though we were past the deadline for returns ( by a few days ) , i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help .
great price .
i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .
i am returning mine for a replacement , but if i receive another ad-2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund , but never buy another apex product in the future .
the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) .
that said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory .
nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes , medium; compact size , price , brand name , good software that is included and previous reviews .
i 'm editing my review , because now i wish i read the manual before returning the player i bought for my girlfriend .
i have a dvd burner .
there have been other occurrences of locking , but i will not bore you with the details .
it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .
if you are n't into paying $ x00 to learn and experiment , or the cons outweigh the pros , then wait a year or so .
first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most aesthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture .
i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me .
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house , that one didn " t work either !
everything else about the camera is great .
now my dissapointments .
what a junk .
this did not give me enough control .
i got this phone in t-mobile 's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal .
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .
had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .
awesome feature .
and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .
the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .
the other controls are all very easy to use .
i accually did n't buy the apex ad-2600 from amazon but , the reviews i found here helped me purchase it .
i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company , some models are better than others .
unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .
a 256 mb player ( roughly 60 songs for me ) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb ( 30,000 mb ) player ( roughly 6,650 songs ) sells for only slightly more .
i 've bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom .
4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .
2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .
i have had great experience with amazon , but i will probably not buy electronics any more from them to avoid any future return problems .
by the way my alias dvds are legit too not no bootleg from the internet .
the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc. other nicities , that you would enjoy .
and then you will start to belive them .
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user-friendly player imo .
of course , unlike that person i will mention that i upgraded the firmware to 1.23 . 00. but i did transfer files before the upgrade without problem too .
1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , " dad ! somethings wrong with the dvd player ! come quick ! "
this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .
the interface used could be better designed .
it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .
the second one was the 2500 which i think is better than the 2600 because it has more features such as karoake which i do use sometimes for parties .
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime .
the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel
i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution .
it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
1 ) fm receiver - some models out there have this .
eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs ( reviewers figures )
do too many stuffs to get to a free phone after rebate .
it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx .
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .
new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays .
the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .
there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free .
but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions , even if they did n't , to which they always seem to expect a " yes " answer from you .
you might think you are saving money by buying an apex but in the long run you will spend more .
remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons .
i just got a 40gb ipod to replace my zen ( a 20gb model ) .
this is a great investment for someone like me who enjoys music and hates carrying multiple cds .
it is great to no longer wonder what music i want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip - now i just take everything .
i cannot recommend it enough ! !
even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal .
i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable .
my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands .
you can sort your music by artist , title , album , or genre , and you can play music based on those categories .
i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .
i highly recommend it .
hi , many people are saying , " you get what you pay for , i guess . "
if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating .
the reasons below will be true for any product in this category .
maybe more competitors will bring out similar products .
you have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to , instead of just connecting it with a usb connection .
it worked .
unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd .
based on hardware one could assume the archos players were horrible ( which by hardware standards .. . they were ) .. .
i then installed the software manually instead , after having to click past about 5 windows of " please register with us so we can spam your inbox " .
otherwise , be smart , save the cash .
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows " no disc . "
wish it included somebody to re-rip all the songs .
8 battery life is excellent .
which was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone ...
i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .
i bought this thing because it plays everything .
i 've owned 6 or 7 dvd players since 1998 .
the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .
just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city / exchange you wanted .
in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % .
when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture !
i got this dvd player as a gift and had to send it back .
if you 're copying cds with windows media , its really simple to give your songs id3 tags , so thats what i do .
7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view .
and most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase .
- bright , visible screen
the software sucks .
they were n't busy enough to charge the credit card , though !
however , the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems .
pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?
i 'm considering using mine as a distraction to winter boredom in the paintball fields .
i have it connected to speakers for a nice musical alarm in the morning .
it 's going back today , &#38; being replaced with the new samsung x105 .
i will never buy a creative product again .
you will have a very expensive paperweight .
this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. .
different people have different needs , of course , but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive .
i treat the battery well and it has lasted .
in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it .
to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .
now let 's talk about the software .
as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you wont scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys .
i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive .
and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .
it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .
it took them twice as long to get to my unit as they said .
the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click .
i have n't tried setting up any playlists yet so i can 't comment on any problems there .
go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense .
the buttons and interface are very easy to use .
this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it .
i checked with nokia .
i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .
it is made of plastic .
i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .
this camera performs like i can not believe !
the flap completely covers the screen because there is no window to see it .
it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc .
you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country .
also , i downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates .
getting the printer to help output them was another tale .
the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact .
i called creative and they said to send it in and they would decide if it in warranty .
reading the reviews , it looks as though people really love this device for a month or two and then come to hate it .
the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .
an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper .
apex does n't answer the phone .
with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .
tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent .
i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .
first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .
after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .
i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time .
what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ?
i believe the napster mp3 player has this feature .
just make sure the keys are locked .
surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .
i 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder .. .
i purchased this unit 3 months back and i think the unit knew when my warrenty expires .
however , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution .
but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately .
no contact phone number , only eamil contact which did not respond me .
they sent me a new ad2600 with the same problem .
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand .
all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet ; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while .
i just bought this player today and i already love it .
creative tech support operators work 9-6 p.m. weekdays - as if i had time during work hours to spend time on this .
do not underestimate this in your purchase decision .
i 'd like a camera phone , but i 'd rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls ...
anyway , the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago - you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product .
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon .
i bought this camera because it fit my budget and the pre-production and production model reviews were positive .
once you start sending files , it 'll continue until it 's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song ... at which point you can skip , skip all , replace , replace all , or cancel .
door broke after a month .
after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .
like most people , i do n't want to read the instructions , i just want to use it .
there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .
i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago .
that 's probably a bad thing .
highly recommended !
i bought this phone when it first came out in the summer .
the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .
i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb .
the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool .
nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .
i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds .
photos had some artifacts and noise .
i have had no problems with the phone .
the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint .
i can only confirm what other customers have said - crap !
but for what i do use it is perfect .
use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) .
so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )
a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .
as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it .
the quality is superb .
overall i 'm happy with my toy .
the prints are beautiful !
worked for two weeks .
the remote is a little hard to understand .
well worth the money .
i can 't fit all that resolution ( 4mp = 2272x 1704 resol . ) in my 19in flat monitor ( 1200x1024 resol . ) anyways .
the pro ...
hope i helped !
its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .
still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera .
this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ).
and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control .
the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now .
it was impossible to do so before .
i cancelled the order .
this provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( .
it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs .
1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .
i think this is it 's biggest flaw .
* main dial is not backlit .
i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy .
this required patience as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it ( which i could do with my flash player ) .
at first i thought it was my headphones but it was not .
it 's a very intuitive program .
if that is for you then pay the money , learn from the experience and you 'll be a more informed buyer when you buy device # 2 .
even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio .
i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .
i have not yet discovered the internet features yet , which i will be doing soon .
not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .
if you watch one dvd per weekm its yours .
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !
they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .
because of the large capacity of the nomad , owners can load hundreds of cds on to it .
so i had to give up and return it , having lost about 4 hours .
excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .
. this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped .
the setup and transfer process was cake for me .
i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all .
you can 't simply open up a folder from the player and play all the songs in it .
i initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining cds to mp3 .
it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .
i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra ... and i was not disappointed .
my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
that beside you are prob. very well aware of many of the features that this phone is known for , and one that has not yet been mentioned : using this phone as a modem for any computer with a usb 1.0 port !
touchups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct .
the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car .
i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time .
a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .
so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can 't use nomad until you get home .
maybe it 's good for tvs with not so good color settings , but not good for my tv that already has very vibrant pictures .
however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .
3 . i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although , i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings .
if you are skeptical about trying apex .
this is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining mp3 's in which i would have never purchased the cd .
( i guess only time will tell ? )
nice little phone ... light compact . .
the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly .
it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !
1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?
the sound from the player is ok .
and then it just froze and now i 'm out $ 300 for their piece of junk .
the person i talked to suggested i take the dvd player back and swap it out with another .
when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .
this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before .
i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .
be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries .
however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .
thankfully amazon has free return shipping !
it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs .
please go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story .
once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .
amazon was supposed to send me another one , but did n't and sent me a gift certificate instead ( i 'm guessing because the price has gone up on this unit since december ).
i was able to return it to the retailer where i bought it and got a replacement .
the player itself has all sorts of problems .
but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !
an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .
i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes !
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .
they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy .
i do n't care how it looks and i always drive so the size is not important to me .
instead , i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in .
if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300 , i would order another just like it .
most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy .
if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk .
to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
this is almost it but not quite but the price was right .
and we all know about the rush to market on new products .
had no problem with it .
it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .
so what 's the point ?
i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on .
i purchased the apex 2600 after reading good reviews of it , both here and in other places .
the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt .
usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast .
however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
i personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad .
after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .
after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for .
i could n't load more than one song before the software crashed .
i didnt wait to experiment .
what the heck is up with the 2600 .
win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs .
the image quality is excellent .
6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .
the camera has a wonderful set of features .
both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going .
do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype .
no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .
i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at .
+ you can have different kind of lens if you want + flashes , etc.
and man ... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player ... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title ..
people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .
that 's been my experience .
80 % of the features on here you will not get by spending $ 100 on a sony or panasonic .
on my main computer the software did not work right .
flash card memory vs. hard drive ( i.e. why does a 256 mb player cost $$$...and a 40 gb ( 40,000 mb ) player only cost
however , the creative software is not real intuitive .
finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 .
do n't waste time looking at anything else , just buy this one .
also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) .
i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .
i love this player .
this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .
the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering !
i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .
well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze .
you can also delete songs from the player itself , and create playlists - on the fly - on your player .
perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy " off " brands .
drop if just a few inches on a hard surface and the faceplate pops off ( but not if it 's in its case ) .
i figured with a great first product and with this one having more features than the 600 i would buy one .
i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .
friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased .
the software failed repeatedly .
the device is larger than an ipod of similar capacity .
after much research i decided on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
then sorting the files is easy as pie .
you have to ask yourself , " how much money is dissapointment worth ? "
so now it still plays everything , you just can 't see it !
the battery life is amazing .
well , maybe that particular song was just corrupt , so i tried to upload some of my own , after four attempts , at each one the unit locked up and required a reboot , i managed to upload an album , which albeit was surprisingly fast , however when attempting to create a playlist out of my newly uploaded songs , the nomad again froze up and refused to work .
i hope my next player doesnt breakdown . .
sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 .
i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting .
the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .
the biggest drawback that people have about the zen xtra is the software .
i would rate this is 4.5 stars picture quality ; image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix .
consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download , it 's well worth the little extra money .
lot 's of other features that i need to find out about .
i purchased this as a christmas gift for my husband .
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .
in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .
often i fill i need to have better organization for the library and there is not enought of variables .
rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .
on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .
zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .
i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .
this bumpy is wicked groovy .
11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player
simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use .
4 ) a set of speakers and a wireless transmitter are accessories that will add to your player 's usability ( the latter will allow you to play it on your car radio , home receiver , etc. )
first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .
the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use .
2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc. ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information .
this will cause the discs not to show up together when you are looking for them on the nomad .
they play just about everything , but # 2 and # 3 died very shortly after getting them .
- no propietary headset jack
i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .
slowly yet surely my unit engorged as i read my own review , similar to when i look in the mirror .
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .
but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it !
if i could give this a negative rating , i would .
you have to buy better ones .
they sell an adapter unit to use with your car 's cassette deck .
in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .
sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much .
the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .
the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !
the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .
i 've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens , but the pictures were too digital .
carry your entire collection !
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .
added 2-24 .
apex sucks !
first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .
card reader is included .
you do n't have this problem if you make your playlist from the nomad , where cds are listed separately .
easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll / pushbutton .
you can find any song quicky by an artist , album , or genre search .
it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .
it took several days of attempts before things finally " worked " again and i have n't a clue why .
i always shoot using the lcd panel .
i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions , but does n't seem any of the buget cameras do .
the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god .
if not i will avoid apex products in the future .
ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier .
but there are certain issues might be they are to me here - all of them are minor; not major ones though ,
i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .
at $ 49 .
there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize .
i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .
my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone .
it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .
we did n't get to use it again for over a month ( sad , i know ) .
gee ... thanks a lot creative .
seriously ! i love it !
i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now .
24 hours ?
i eventually gave up with customer support and worked on fixing the problem myself .
