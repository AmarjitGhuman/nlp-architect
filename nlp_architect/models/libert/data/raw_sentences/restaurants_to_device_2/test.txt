i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots .
the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )
software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .
the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight .
but it works perfectly fine on my parent 's computer .
i like the way apple is innovative , but let 's face it - they can 't be the only one with an idea to enclose a 2.5 " hd within an aluminum case in a stylish package for long , especially after the buzz is out of their little techie pod .
got way too many blurry pictures .
i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it 's job .
itunes is a versatile program and i have n't had any issues with the ipod itself .
enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience .
if i wasnt a runner i would take a bullet in the foot for my nomad jukebox .
because this camera is beautiful .
the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too .
bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations .
so far so good , no problems , no conversions .
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category .
after using it for a few weeks ( the amount of time before the hard drive crashed ) it revealed a few of its shortcommings .
the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .
it defaulted to unchangeable email .
at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice .
- uploading music is quick and easy .
ok so i donno about what other people said , how the player breaks and stuff , and the headfone jack , fortunately that did not happen to me .
my pda becames a digital album .
hope i 've been of some help .
i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .
tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .
it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !
for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds .
now as others said , so far this player is an awesome player , there are flaws .
i suppose that you could jog with it but it seems to be made for the enjoyment of music .
- you just have to buy a new player .
great job canon !
overall , a good buy for the price .
interface - practically seamless .
another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself .
the headphone jack acts as a pseudo line out jack .
another stupid move .
after installing it and trying to make it working for 30 minutes i went and bought notmad .
they stop time .
this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !
we tried it out christmas night and it worked great .
in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .
that was n't pretty .
one broke , one got stolen , and then i bought the riovolt sp - 350 .
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box !
yet they 've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone , including italian , german , and dutch .
we tried the " finding nemo " dvd and when we got to ~ chapter 28 , the frames started to freeze for no reason .
despite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic , i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually .
the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .
signal strength will affect the battery life .
there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board .
recently , i attended a " flyball " competition
needless to say , the canon won , hands down .
honestly , the best players without any flaws were the goddam cd players .
big mistake .
these problems were consistent , and also not present on another dvd player .
nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality .
unfortunately it turns out to be the " disposable " type .
still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features !
if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .
this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .
why i do n't can this product without a plan ?
loved the slim design .
my favorite is to play " any track " - am rediscovering my music !
this is not a player you can take jogging .
as it is , i 'm keeping the machine .
thank you !
so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos .
i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally .
the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year " no questions asked " replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !
i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard .
battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .
5 for " digital film " it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome .
yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .
one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing .
creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery .
i might have gotten a lemon , but this is not the first report of video output failure on this machine .
for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised .
this seemed like a really good compromise .
however , the music and data are apparently not separated ; ipod reviewers complain about " white noise " in random feedback mode that comes from appointments / contacts created on the ipod during synchronization .
so far the player froze on me once ( i started pushing buttons before it loaded ) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that .
i do n't think so .
it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ).
although you may think you 're dealing with amazon , you 're dealing with some second rate store that you 've never heard of .
have used it frequently and have had no problems .
yup , right back for a refund !
i was planning on getting an ipod , but i changed my mind last minute ... mostly because of the whole battery issue , i do n't have the patience for those sorta things .
you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .
that way i could keep it in the case all the time .
we got a familyplan from t-mobile which saves us tons .
i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .
if i knew then what i know now i would have paid the extra to get an ipod & avoided the zen .
the sony ericsson phone ( t610 ) has the most whistles and bells , but is also the hardest to use .
compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .
i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode .
have tried calling ( 866-4apexgo ) , but can 't get through .
from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles .
it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .
and also , it 's priced very affordably .
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .
the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .
here 's why :
( my orignal review is below : )
else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately " fine **" picture quality " image size : 1600 .
this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of " now playing " interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .
i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever .
the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings .
oh ... one more thing .
however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .
guess i will return it for an exchange and hope for the best with the new one .
what a disappointment !
just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos .
i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n't work !
i 've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual .
it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier .
also , if i want a family plan , which mean i need tw phones on a plan .. .
great camera , great investment !
- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last .
if you happen to push the wrong button , you can wipe out the order of songs you had put in .
which means that in trying to save a few hundred dollars , i 'll end up spending more than twice that .
i love this camera .
i bought this last week through amazon .
only con i can think of is no camera ... .
then it rips the tunes into mp3s and puts them on your computer .
4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ).
i love photography .
if you want to be a poser and follow the herd , mooooooh , then buy the i-pod .
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .
it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds .
press the p/n button located on the bottom right corner of the remote .
transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .
while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that , an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it .
just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date .
in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?
the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .
if i had to do this again , i might get the 40gb zen .
not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording
it has a hold button to deactivate the buttons to avoid accidents ; however , enough reviewers have complained that the hold button is easily broken and then the device can 't be used .
i got an rma from creative , sent my player in to them for repairs .
if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .
i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker .
the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive .
this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .
be forewarned .
output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv .
all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .
some of the more geeky ( non-apple type ) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface .
i agree with the positive reviews .
i was going to get a 10gb ipod , but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com ( battery lasts 18 months ;
this would not be a great problem if you did n't have so much info to scroll through on a regular basis .
however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy .
the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .
fact is , it could n't be easier to use .
my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 " screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 " monitor .
3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .
the features are really cool like the radio .
playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options .
i do n't want to install software and drivers on every computer i 'm ever at .
" you can send it in , but i would n't count on ever seeing it or a replacement again .
so far i 've only had it since christmas , so i cant tell you much about the battery life .
highly recommended .
any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort .
however , if anyone has participated in violent or extreme sports while using their zen , please share your experiences .
i do n't really like bounce .
save your cash - go for a brand that actually cares about their reputation .
very large pics take 8mb each !
my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .
it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .
i can 't simply bring up my entire list of songs , click play , and then hit next .
we use older versions 880 , 885 of this model in the office and i find them to produce excellent quality photos .
i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year .
- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it .
i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still can 't get a video signal from the machine .
was i just unlucky at that moment ?
each of the 4 lasted less than six months .
i cant do anything about it , and i have to send back .
it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up .
you wo n't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans.
the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .
this phone is a winner ...
a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards .
i got every song i had downloaded to the player within a day or so .
the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small .
i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it 's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) .
manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
i bought my nikon coolpix4300 about a week ago .
this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared .
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .
it 's almost like having a media player / file manager built into the dvd player .
hopefully you still have the remote control .
for other problems go to http://www.apexdigitalinc.com/support.asp
also , the lens cap design is flawed .
now i dont have to lug around 80 cds if i dont know what i 'm going to want to listen to biking home .
great features . .
so i took it back to best buy where i bought it and exchanged it for a newer zen 20 gig model .
i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .
you have to add all the songs to a play list .
the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .
i got it now , and i 'm diggin ' it .
try to buy a high capacity ultra card , as it 's 2x as faster as the regular cf card .
using this method , i have not once encountered a situation where a track was rejected , and i have plenty of duplicate tracks on live and compilation albums .
if you are planning to buy that player , do not !
unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved .
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc .
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?
i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) .
come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones .
software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .
it would have been better to have some sort of window on teh carrying case , so you could see the display without opening it .
the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .
i looked up the ipod , the dell jukebox , and the samsung napster player .
for an early christmas gift , i got a zen xtra 40 gb player .
notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx .
. lens cap is a really annoying
try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems .
but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n't anticipate any problems with it .
i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner .
i would replace them with some better sounding and more comfortable phones .
hopefully the replacement from amazon will work just fine .
the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple .
i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;
none of these are perfect .
it will not load any further songs on and customer service has no idea what to do .
i was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke .
once again , the sound is awesome , the batter life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life .
pros summary :
since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make .
case - the nomad comes with a leather holding case .
the zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced .
i give it 10 stars !
4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery 's out is not included , although one can be purchased separately .
the first one would n't work from the start .
this problem vanished after the first month , so i assume it was a temporary dust issue .
i received the apex ad-2600 before i expected .
and so far , i 've been very pleased .
final verdict :
i bought this dvd player in november .
would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .
3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip .
the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .
it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid .
it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
upon inspection i did find a small scratch on the surface and figured that to be the cause .
one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) .
i currently have ~ 1100 songs encoded mostly at 196 kpbs and i have n't even used 10gb of storage yet .
this is my fourth mp3 player ( creative nomad jukebox2 and 3 , rio chie , and this one ) , and my third player from creative .
apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy .
for the average music listener not expecting much ... this may be a satisfactory mp3 player ...
i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar .
wow , dennis sure is great !
i end up unplugging it from the wall for a few hours and when i try again it will work fine.at least until this problem arises again .
this would have been much easier .
bottom line for me is that for the price i do n't think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player .
the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .
if the casing of the player is this bad , i can 't image that the hardware is of very good quality .
after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all .
the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .
within 5 minutes i was able to transfer files .
the included memory card is too small .
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector .
i did buy the telephoto lens ( and the required extension ) .
the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad .
i saw another review saying his only gripe was a lack of voice dialing .
a nice camera bag , which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger .
b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage .
the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .
furher it contains a card reader , a flash card folder for up to 8 cards , a lense cleaning rag , and an ac adapter , which is very helpful when working in an " outlet environment " .
software downloads on the site crashed my pc .
if it does , ill give up .
if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe .
i am returning the broken one today .
this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas .
in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .
for the price and features it is really good .
after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it .
the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .
controls are a bit awkward .
i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review .
i quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me .
they would n't repair my camera unless if i pay $ 100 for parts ? and labor !
i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .
this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .
still , had to send it back to nikon for repair .
have had the player since xmass and love it !
this is all i have to say .
the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .
it suppose to play everything .
great phone .. .
no difference .
boy was i wrong .
even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .
it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .
im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button !
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying .
if you have always on internet or are logged into the internet you can use the feature that will download the album & song id information ( this is a free service ) with the click of a button .
forget about it .
it 's no problem for me personally .
any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor , along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support .
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the " rigor " of a business traveler .
there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev. machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance .
at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .
it has 2 games .
even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them .
the only good thing about this whole process , is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back , because of the price difference between when i bought it , and now .
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .
from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to .
overall design :
hope someone else has better luck !
anybody can explain that ?
my sister has this series of phone and she loves the radio and headset .
if you have any multi-disc box sets , you 'll notice that the artist 's name , album name , and genre will often change with every disc .
with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .
now what about the flash problem ?
after using the bulky 3650 for three weeks , i searched for a smaller alternative .
the player : it 's silver .
this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .
for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer .
the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's .
but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on it have a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments .
seemed like a good deal , but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes , " no disc " .
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .
will never purchase apex again .
i particularly like the " txt " file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take .
it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims .
great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.
reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item .
all i am looking for is a rebate form !
first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .
get it , it 's woth every penny ! !
otherwise , this player is awesome !
in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !
i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all .
this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .
overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )
transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .
i purchased it for it 's easy ability to accept cd-r hacks .
the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .
it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .
for the price it is a well spent investment !
ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
you can stop playback by pressing 2 buttons , first the pause button , then the " next track " or " previous track " button .
of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest .
it takes great pictures .
i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99 .
on several different occasions it has displayed " no disc " with a disc inside .
5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
it really does n't make any cents $ $ to build a great reputation then destroy it from lack a research and testing in one season .
it may have taken several years to fill this up .
he spent another half hour on the phone with tech support , to no avail .
the trouble shooting section in the user 's manual , suggesting correct and secure connections , does n't help .
- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .
i discovered this weekend that itunes does not sell mp3 's in the mp3 format .
i had downloaded about 1000 songs and had room for another 9000 !
you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though .
i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera .
what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .
not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well .
i took the camera and just gave it to someone .
a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine .
we are overall pleased with product .
there 's a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330 , especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures .
i am very pleased with it so far .
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .
* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ).
i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .
i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
i forgot , the case does n't fit .
so how can i do that ... are n't that free for two after the rebates .
the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .
i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .
they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .
one thing puzzles me is that for " fine and 2200 + " quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .
my room is so dark and when i tried taking pics of it with my old camera , they came out black , but with this , they look the same in the picture as in real life .
now honestly , i love this player , but with all seriousness , i would not recommend it to other people , because of the breakdown flaw. and i honestly would not recomment the people of the ipod , that crap sucks big donkey ..... never mind .
that 's the first thing to understand .
whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card , usb card reader , camera bag and the warranty .
personally , i do n't understand all the complaints about the interface .. .
you can get weather , movies , horoscopes and more with a few clicks .
third party software to the rescue
a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models .
i am very pleased so far .
to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ;
i 'll still use my photosuite for editing .
i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .
i am an amateur photographer and here is a piece of advise to all the folks who are thinking about making a move the digital world .
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .
if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get " stuck " rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .
in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software
we saw reviews that said the same thing , and also saw here that their customer service stinks .
my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity .
i did that and re-installed the software but had the same error .
after reading all the glowing review on this camera , i went to my local camera shop to try one .
the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .
now i can always be in contact .
c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said
the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying .
about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc .
finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .
finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 .
( 28 not 30 because software itself takes space ) .
the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .
veteran zen users have explained how to stop if that 's what you want .
the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera .
this is nothing new , every mp3 player , memory card , etc. , used for digital media today has some kind of preloaded operating software on it .
again , you can change this , but it 's harder to spot a minor variation in the title when you do n't have the title of the other disk in front of you .
first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .
i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out .
bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent .
f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course
and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness .
this is not the same thing as a film camera .
a great new use for that underutilized computer .
+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
it took maybe 15 minutes to transfer 1000 songs .
ipod can be used as an external disk , and apparently stores files without problem .
it is crystal clear .
cheaper in every way .
i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .
do n't waste your time , engery , resources on this thing , just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod .
accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .
the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling .
this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks .
what a disappointment .
i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it .
the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons .
5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .
sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .
you can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions .
the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life .
even better , ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap .
i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment .
installed software .
after messing with it at a store i noticed how bad the i-pod was .
now getting back to this .
because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's .
fiance did n't like the feel .
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .
those that have it like it .
like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product .
what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy .
luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can 't .
( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ).
pass this player up , and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas !
the volume .
not good if you 're taking this traveling .
stayed up all night trying to figure out that thing .
after having had my heart broken by a sexy piece of hardware that simply would n't perform .
1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 " or 5x7 " prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 " photos once in a while .
i love my g2 so thought i would upgrade .
review of zen xtra - 40 gb
the reception and sound quality are top-notch .
they look fantastic .
the karma does have a stop button .
the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code , but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go .
before anyone says hey you have n't used the product , i have , my friend received one for christmas instead of an ipod and has since envied me for my vastly superior product .
the ipod 's white plastic look / surface does n't suit me .
i have a large collection of cds and have loaded over 100 of them so far .
5 . the 1/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments .
my " fast forward " button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go .
i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason .
i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .
if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed , i would rate this a 5 star machine .
i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n't do it !
my 2.6 mhz pentium 4 with usb 2.0 was able to perform the task pretty quickly ( i would estimate ~ 5 - 8 minutes per cd ).
i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal .
the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly
after two weeks the picture kept freezing .
yes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay .
this is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway .
i was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base .
the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !
8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
again had to remove the battery .
you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck
but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .
there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation .
mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs .
zens rule .
the light auto-correction is awesome .
2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .
i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .
i would have given this thing 4.5 stars but since i can 't , i 'll be sweet and give it the full 5 stars .
it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .
so , if you read the instructions well , you should n't have any problems with this dvd unit .
therefore im saying im returning it right now , and i will see wat happens with my next zen xtra ( same replacement ) .
second , the " automatic " sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .
it goes nicely with my apex 27 " in my bedroom .
third , the poor design continues with the case .
but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .
the devices competing with the ipod are the iriver ihp 120 , the rio karma , and the philips hdd100 .
it 's not a big deal for me .
on my relatively new computer ( p4 with windows xp and usb 2.0 ) , the os complained about the installation of the drivers .
no way to contact their customer service .
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic !
i experimented with installing mediasource on 2 other computers at home and it worked fine .
those who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it .
my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up .
you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost .
but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw :
i bought coolpix 4300 two months after i had bought canon powershot s400 .
5 hours max. i did it like this
after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift .
the title says it all ...
i got this player for christmas & this was my first time using an mp3 player .
as i travel quite a lot , i 'd want something with gsm as well as cdma tri-band .
the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did .
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings .
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .
now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems .
just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc.
cheaper to produce , holds a lot , heavier and has moving parts which means it 's a little more prone to damage from being banged around .
a similarily priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room .
having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying .
the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod .
i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box .
at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast !
the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .
for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital .
the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .
i like the size and weight of this little critter .
overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .
it was either the 40gb ipod or this one .
this thing does its job .
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .
the good news is if you can 't get it to reset / reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it .
i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it .
it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .
it 's a winner .
in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !
i had apex regular ( non-progressive ) dvd-player for two years .
player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 .
i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept .
all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .
ok , im writing yet another review , about a week from my previous one .
made the camera totally inoperable .
in two transfer batches ( first was english songs , then foreign languages ) , it did n't come up with any errors ( aside the duplicate name i mentioned ).
depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models .
also , there is the need to send the ipod to replace the batteries when they die ( which they will ).
well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) .
this is especially useful for those who listen mostly to pop music and store all those short ditties .
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .
and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .
the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .
there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted .
the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .
but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .
overall it is the best camera on the market .
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .
at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my " alias " dvds as well .
that was annoying .
i shopped around for a while before buying a hard-drive mp3 player .
one minor complaint :
the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .
( 1 gb = 1,000 mb )
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ).
i simply watched the extra features on another player .
personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more .
as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) .
a disipointed customer .
amazon , do your customers a big favor , do n't carry this item , and give them refunds !
on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good .
if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !
you will be sorry if you do .
now i know better .
unlike some of the other people who received a " lemon " , my dvd player came in perfect working condition .
the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .
redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more !
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .
great phone , i 'd buy another .
so , without further adoo .
i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous .
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .
it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .
what the hell is wrong with this thing .
does n't always register push-button movement .
if you tossed it out the window , you need to fetch it .
originally i wanted the ipod .
whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together .
noiseless , light weight and oh yeah .
one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing .
since the ipod lacks this review feature on its auto-sync and it only allows one-way transfers , the first time i connected my ipod to my laptop , i wiped out the 20gb of music i had transferred from my desktop to the ipod .
the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .
i 'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i 've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top , but that does n't stop me from loving this camera .
this phone plays up to 4 tones at one time and it actually sounds like music .
i have tried the belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter but found there was too much interference .
depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .
do n't drop this unit :
i 'd have given it 5 stars , but i 'm waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one :
8mb for a camera like this is a joke .
with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation .
otherwise it 'll get there the day you get back from the hospital !
i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation .
also bought a soundblaster card that they sold for the mac .
the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .
as some other reviewers noted , after it was connected to the computer for a bit , it somehow stopped reading the player so i had to replug it .
but i did n't because i 'm used to electronic products having a 12 month warranty .
took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
i think that it is a were good mobile phone and i may buy it .
features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names .
anyone looking for more than " point and shoot " can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .
( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .
this meant that i had to take all my cds and do in a fairly short period of time what i had done over a year at work .
it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .
the canon g3 .
the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .
i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember :
for the money , get a better quality player .
3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .
it 's just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments .
it did have scored over all other competitors ....
it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .
quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .
- some features in the user interface
but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera .
i do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand .
with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod .
my office would not let me put the software on to my work computer .
it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .
that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw .
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .
able to use service in another country :
3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .
i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .
had to cut out a window using a swiss army knife .
a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
and should they not know it , they can find it out pretty quick .
3 . it 's a hazard in the car .
i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .
i ended up suing windows player to make mp3 's ( actually wma files ) and then using the probram to transfer .
it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .
if you dont get video back , now you can run the player over with your car !
do n't buy this thing .
in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself .
it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls .
the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .
forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer .
also , if i had already loaded and tagged by cds on my home computer , this would not have been an issue .
my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .
i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !
the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .
i changed video cables , tried connecting to tv on input1 and input2 but no help .
i finally joined the 21st century and bought this dvd player .
truly , i am quite impressed . . ! !
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .
b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display
it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much .
you will be told goldstar codes work , and you will be told zenith codes will work , and radio shack will give you apex codes but they will not work .
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen .
anyway , im gon na go find dennis now , have a nice day ! ! !
great design and looks cool .
still , apple continues to squeeze dollars from consumers by not designing the battery to be replaceable .
on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .
the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla .
well that is not true .
the lcd screen was very large and readable .
the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .
i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .
while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd .
i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far .
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .
that 's important because i have a lot of music .
settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .
i definately recommend a large memory card .
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .
it plays all my back-ups , + or - , and everything else i have put in it without a hick up .
zen good points :
it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .
the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful " scene " mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless .
perhaps there is a way around this delay .
navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .
nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .
did i mention i 've already dropped it once ?
after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .
it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .
once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player .
also , very light and portable .
it has a classic design yet looks hip .
so now i 've got to call their customer " service " ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back .
this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure .
the description of the warranty is buried on the supplied set up cd .
this thing kicks mighty apple butt !
here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of " plastic-like " ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .
the movie mode is also working great .
it looks great - and is loaded with features .
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .
i tried to play the song three times , with no success .
great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .
d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on
i received this dvd player free with the purchase of a palm tungsten e from officemax .
they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply .
it says i have a harddisk problem .
this explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players .
if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for .
hope the unit lasts as i 've only had it for 3 days .
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack .
great feature list , poor reliability .
at the same time , i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons .
the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .
the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )
there was very little light in there .
even if it has n't expired , creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty .
i am quite happy with the camera .
i purchased a jukebox 3 from creative almost a year ago .
about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .
just maintain them ( phonebook , calendar and to-do list ) in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth .
the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone " unlike the nokia 3650 " and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make ...
focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
no complaints there .
that 's a rare and valuable feature .
radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpiece in .
3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players
saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable , as i already had a coax cable .
people complain about the scroll wheel , but its not a big deal at all ( though it is just a little annoying at times ) .
all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product .
so far i 've played regular dvd 's , backup dvd-r 's , mp3 cd 's , and regular cd 's .
( wo n't leave copy on your computer . )
once i actually got to an answering machine and left a message .
in fact , my boyfriend is now going to invest into one of these suckers as well ... now he realizes that this is the best choice over his current archos and the ipod he was eyeing .
despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. .
overall i like it .
although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan , they still did n't ship it .
the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks .
+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit
i like the automatic key lock function .
this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .
so it was no loss .
nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon .
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .
the way to fix this is to rename the track by adding a number yourself to the end of the track listing .
great screen and great sound .
- price : see above .
i bought this player during a christmas sale at an excellent price .
" enjoy " !
warning - i did read the manual !
so it is probably " just bad luck " on my part that the personal notebook i own had this install error .
zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .
i am a business user who heavily depend on mobile service .
i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up .
now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk .
i originally purchase a 30 gb nomad zen xtra as a portable mp3 player .
but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working .
i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards .
the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .
also , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy .
( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however )
usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it .
i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .
pay a few more bucks and get something else - it 'll be worth it in the long run .
after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us .
also the ipod has games on it .
- the unit is easy to use and intuitive .
please , if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions , i 'm wait very happy .
output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold .
every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .
1 ) price / gb of storage
while i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it .
i bought the 2600 because it plays everything !
but that 's a moot point now .
compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use .
if you buy the stereo headset , you will enjoy it much more .
i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either .
i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags .
to discover this i had to read about 10 online reviews ( with many complaints about the lack of stop button ) before i found one reviewer who was smart enough to both figure it out & document it .
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .
i would recommend buying one .
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .
5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control .
hope this review has helped you in making up your mind .
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .
i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .
unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is " player either not connected or busy . "
picture on web site clearly has the play display pictured , yet false silver plate .
once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers .
they refunded my $ $ $ so fast and paid for the shipping back .
the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .
even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
if you really need to save , buy this thing on amazon , they eventually gave me a full refund .
after i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't .
note : this will add about $ 30 to the price to purchase , but worth it
the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .
olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body .
it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen .
aight den bumpy ?
if you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble .
also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .
the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .
looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive .
some things that i did n't like ( but hey . nothing is perfect ).
when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff .
i wanted to use the nomad with a cassette style car adapter .
7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .
beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .
i 've called the service number and if it 's not busy , it rings forever then eventually dumps you .
the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .
those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. .
can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .
canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .
having my entire music collection is great when travelling ( both on plane and car trips ) and i do n't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it 's all there .
i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .
but they offer only a 3-month warranty ( on all of their players , including the zen xtra ) .
reason for two ?
if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .
however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips .
while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones .
i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered .
the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel .
the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk .
with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more .
no issues as of yet
i finally decided to upgrade , and started my research .
the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie " extras " on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that .
and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod .
i liked this one enough to buy another .
it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here .
other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .
the first one was the 705 which i hacked successfully to play all region dvds and disable macrovision .
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .
if creative offered a 12-month warranty on their mp3 players , i 'd be covered .
the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )
the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .
the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies .
7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .
i 'm starting to listen to cd 's that i have n't listened to in years now that i have them all handy in one place .
or save time and just do it , you wo n't regret it .
sure it 's " old school " to carry a cd wallet around , but it will be easier to manage and i 'll save around 250 bucks .
it 's been so long since i 've had a program not shut down on me in windows that i hardly even noticed that it happened .
it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .
hard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory ) .
granted it is a little more than the zen , it is well worth it .
i use my own mid-priced headphones rather than the enclosed earbuds .
you know why ?
or does it play audio and video but scrolling in black and white ?
very bad quality .
you have to add them to the playing list .
below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends :
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .
the ad-1600 did n't work corectly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up .
i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died .
it wo n't play all of my movies .
the storage capacity is great for me --
again , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional .
best electronic i 've bought since i was born .
because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !
the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .
4 ) it did play my jpeg photos but wow , trying to figure it out was really something !
3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .
fair warning - do not buy .
i did n't had any problem till now .
the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .
lastly , the price is fantastic :
. if you want to have the date ; time on the image , its only through their software " nikon view " which reads the images date ; time from the images meta-data .
3 ) user replaceable battery
i have not been disappointed with my purchase .
there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) .
well that was not a simple task .
i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash unit .
this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cdr / cdrw / dvdr / dvdrw , and of course plays dvd movies from uk. i love the aiff , progressive scan feature .
the powershot g3 is a great camera .
the distortion is not a flaw .
after investigating a multitude of player options , i asked for and received the 60 gb zen xtra for christmas .
i got one of these to serve as a second dvd player in my house .
it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .
1 no direct firewire to the camera .
the nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six .
some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get .
* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .
this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .
their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .
i feel that once i contact amazon that they will get to the bottom of this .
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .
now i may buy two !
wo n't play a lot of discs .
i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work !
the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
having to copy / delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage .
unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box .
every t-mobile plan comes with gsm data , meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps ( with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference ) .
- solid , high-quality construction
after " loading " for what seemed like a very long time , the display indicated " no disk " .
i have n't quite figured this one out yet , but it is probably operator error .
if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .
i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera .
the plus points are -
has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
by what time standards -- martian ?
this junky is super duper rad. it be my fav c-phone and stuff .
as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .
great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes
i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will .
e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage
if my level of care was n't good enough , i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two .
if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there .
when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain .
both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice .
if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books .
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .
the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) .
the value , name , and resolution signed the lease .
( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )
i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s , and it 's a lot nicer to access them 4.5 gb at a time ( dvd-r ) than 0.7 gb at a time ( cd-r ) !
the " scene " mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a " regular " setting .
these models now ship with creative 's mediasource program , which allows you to highlight the files on your computer that you want to add to your zen xtra , click a button , and transfer it straight to your player .
sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod .
the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .
but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .
you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution .
if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one .
i returned to the store , whereupon the clerk insisted that he could make it work ; he could n't .
i 've yet to be dissappointed .
the cd just has too many problems with win xp .
most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist .
the first one we installed did n't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least .
* scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models .
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use .
the reason for this the ipod has " a better user interface " .
just get some new headphones and your set .
so what ?
6 . the g2 's " color effect " exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable " effect func " menu option available in all exposure modes .
go for it !
after about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player .
as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !
- included creative software is pretty poor .
otherwise feedback seems to be good .
i was a little disappointed in the low end .
what kind of a company does that !
this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .
the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked .
typically people use 96kbs to 320 kps.
you will find it very hard or impossible to get you money back .
word ... peace in the east bruvah .
i 'm very glad i did .
my personal favorite is the karma ( i currently own a karma , a zen usb 2.0 , a philips hdd100 , and an upgraded 60 gig archos jukebox recorder ).
yes it is 56k speed , but the functionality is what you are paying for .
