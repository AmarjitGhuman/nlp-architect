The 17 in Macbook Pro has been a wonderful addition .
It 's been a couple weeks since the purchase and I 'm struggle with finding the correct keys ( but that was expected ) .
The display is incredibly bright , much brighter than my PowerBook and very crisp .
I will not hesitate to recommend it to family and friends
The " Time remaining " goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes .
I paid $ 800 for this computer from my school campus bookstore .
It 's so quick and responsive that it makes working/surfing on a computer so much more pleasurable !
it has 3 usb ports , 1 sd memory card reader and an sd memory car expansion .
The tech guy then said the service center does not do 1-to-1 exchange and I have to direct my concern to the " sales " team , which is the retail shop which I bought my netbook from .
It 's the inside that is truly wonderful .
I think I might rather suffer for something that is simple to fix in my opinion .
And it did n't show up on the reciept , I do n't know how we ordered it online !
It was also suffering from hardware ( keyboard ) issues , relatively slow performance and shortening battery lifetime .
Very disappointed with Apple .
After 20-30 min the screen of the notebook switched off .
I paid about 18000 for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me .
And these are some reasons you should get a macbook pro .
The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box , all the functions works great .
I 've owned this labtop for less then two months , already the mouse button has broke .
The only thing I did n't learn in my research was the software I would need like privacy protection and warranty protection , in case it gets broken , or crashes etc .
For the same price , you get a lot more in the Asus .... 1920x1080 res .
It is better than my old acer laptop .
Aside from the trial software and the short battery life , lack of a webcam , its great .
I especially like the backlit keyboard .
Small screen somewhat limiting but great for travel .
Just a bunch of idiots who 's English as a 5th language is forced at best .
Then it ceased charging at all .
I had a toshiba for 10 years .
Temperatures on the outside were alright but i did not track in Core Processing Unit temperatures .
I was tired of going without my laptop every few weeks .
The only thing is that the battery wo n't last more than 1/2 an hour .
I wish it had a webcam though , then it would be perfect !
Nightly my computer defrags itself and runs a virus scan .
Keyboard is great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable .
A * big * upgrade from my 13 " 2006 macbook .
I went to Toshiba online help and found some suggestions to fix it .
WHEN TYPING , LETTERS AND SPACES ARE FREQUENTLY OMITTED REQUIRING THE USER TO REDO MANY WORDS AND SENTENCES .
That system is fixed .
The receiver was full of superlatives for the quality and performance .
You know what ? I happened to buy a defective blood pressure monitor a week ago at the Bukit Batok Polyclinic NHG Pharmacy a week ago .
It did n't take me long to get switched over to the Mac computer programs and navigation - it 's been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better .
This is what they told me : It heats up , and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops , and simply categorize them as portables .
It has good speed and plenty of hard drive space .
A great feature is the spotlight search : one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword , rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document .
Hope this helps !
The computer blinks it shuts off at will .
the volume is really low to low for a laptopwas not expectin t volume to be so lowan i hate that about this computer
I was considering buying the Air , but in reality , this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient , even though it 's about .20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier .
It freezes , and it always shows that there is an error , so I have to restart it a few times every time I use it .
I can render AVCHD movies with little effort , which was a problem for most pc 's unless you had a quad core I7 .
They only stay charged a little over an hour .
Tried to make a recovey disk wouldnt get passed the first recovery disk .
Either way the entire thing was just a joke , a complete rip off !
and plenty of storage with 250 gb ( though I will upgrade this and the ram . . )
She brought out 2 other identical netbooks and still insist that " It is like that one " .
I love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the Laptop in the sky !!
The only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets , and rather quickly too .
$ 999.00 Tax free .
The track pad to me is what really stands out though , you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pad , awesome thinking Apple !
not using wired lan not sure what thats about .
Apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached .
Buy it , love it , and I promise you wo n't regret it .
great battery life .
No machine has come remotely close to causing as many problems .
Quite simply this is the best laptop I have ever owned .
so we got a good deal on hsn for an ascer notebook and we bought it for him .
It is much better than the Acer ultrabook I had before .
It is short on space , and downloads always had problems being completed , or were said to be ' corrupted ' .
The only thing I do n't understand is that the resolution of the screen is n't high enough for some pages , such as Yahoo!Mail .
Also , my sister got the exact same laptop ( since they were so cheap ) and after 8 months , the screen split in half just from everyday use .
The paint wears off easily due to the keyboard being farther back than usual .
I ' ts nice to have the higher-end laptops , but this fits my budget and the features I need .
The programs are great , like iphoto ( love the editing capabilities ) , imail ( which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad ) , imovie , etc .
But to be honest , the compatibility issues and the other little quirks make me think I ll buy a PC next time .
Even though it is much more expensive than many PC laptops , it is worth the price .
Then , within 5 months , the charger crapped out on me .
This Mac Mini makes the Macbook Pro seem slow .
Then the system would many times not power down without a forced power-off .
I would like to use a different operating system altogether .
The reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me ( I prefer it dark ) or if you can crank up the brightness .
I had to call Apple 19 times ( each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone ) , and take it to their store for evaluations , and diagnostics , 5 times .
And now I am a proud MacBook owner also !
As a die-hard Windows enthusiast , I shunned the idea of a Mac until this point .
I purchased it this year when my old HP laptop finally died and I was looking for something smaller and lighter than a laptop to carry around for classes and traveling .
I do not recommend this company or their products !!!!
My MacBook is probably the best investment I have ever made .
I now travel with this laptop and my work PC .
I also purchased iWork to go with it which has programs for word processing , spreadsheets , and presentations ( similar to Microsoft Office ) .
Vista is a nightmare .
Iphoto is great for adding pictures right to facebook and other social networking sites .
I am not much of a computer techie , so I can understand some of the internal problems , though I do have trend micro as an antiviral program .
Because it IS a defective product .
I know that everyone thinks Macs are overpriced and overrated , but once you get past the initial expense you 'll find that they 're worth every penny ( besides , there 's always the financing plan that Best Buy offers ) .
While most people say that PCs hold functionality and value and Macs are just pretty to look at , I think there 's something to be said about the simplicity of Macs .
EITHER WAY , THE KEYBOARD IS UNSATISFACTORY .
I purchased an HP right after my high school graduation .
This is something i would deffinately reccomend to someone .
The best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features .
Cons : Screen resolution .
Runs like a champ .....
I got assurances from 2 different people that the remaining 10 months of my warranty would transfer to the new computer .
Very Very Highly Recommended .
There is no need to purchase virus protection for Mac , which saves me a lot of time and money .
The only thing I dislike is the touchpad , alot of the times its unresponsive and does things I dont want it too , I would recommend using a mouse with it .
Externally the keys on my keyboard are falling off , after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit , and the screen has a terrible glare .
Now I could get myself a cheap computer , that will probably work a whole lot better !
My Mac is much more efficient than a PC so it does not need the extra bells and whistles to compete .
I would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express .
It has spent more time in repair shops than i can possibly recount here .
Very light and easily maneuverable .
A veryimportant feature is Firewire 800 which in my experience works better then USB3 ( in PC enabled with USB3 ) I was not originally sold on the MAC OS I felt it was inferior in many ways To Windows 7 .
It is easily portable and I take it everywhere I go and might require internet access .
I blame the Mac OS .
HP said it was out of warranty .
The only objection I have is that after you buy it the windows 7 system is a starter and charges for the upgrade .
It 's a nice little gadget .
The large screen gives you the option to comfortably watch movies or TV shows on your computer instead of buying an additional TV for your dorm room .
I tell everyone I see out looking to get this or another Toshiba .
One of the smartest thing I did was take my time to compare laptops before making my purchase .
It is easy to go from one keyboard to another .
There is no need to open a program first and the cliick open or import .
That whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $ 175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $ 175 and it was fixed .
Further , this Mac Mini has a sloppy Bluetooth interface ( courtesy of the Mac OS ) and the range is poor .
A lot of help they WERE N'T !
Also is portable and reliable .
i love the size of the computer since i play games on it .
The laptop is very lightweight , can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight .
For my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin ( it happened 7 months ago ) they offered me an ITouch 8Gig ( you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich , offer a loyal customer like me , a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this ) .
The performance seems quite good , and built-in applications like iPhoto work great with my phone and camera .
Cost is more as compared to other brands .
Apple " Help " is a mixed bag .
No tutorials on the display .
I never tried any external mics with that iMac .
After a couple of years , my battery life began to diminish but was replaced for free due to a company-wide recall of my particular battery .
It did everything we expected !
it definitely beats my old mac and the service was great .
It was always getting froze up .
Amazing machine .
i try to use it today and I ca n't logon .
It is easy to use , fast and has great graphics for the money .
It does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern .
This is what I call a good after sales service .
It is stamped and not in pieces therefore it is a stronger more resilient frame .
I used to build my own desktops from the component parts , and recently my 7 year old Pentium 4 with HT 1 GB ram SATA desktop stopped working ( this was a rock star 7 years ago ) .
Battery is not upgradable to a longer life battery .
I saved for this laptop for 3 months and I can tell you personally it was worth the wait .
Quality Display I love HP , , it 's the only computer/printer we will buy .
I think that they are the best out on the market .
But with this laptop , the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sounding tinny .
Nice packing .
the internet can be an scary place its up to you on what you do with it .
Sells for the same as a netbook without sacrificing size .
I have to wonder why Amazon is even selling this dinosaur .
I work on a PC at home and have used Pc all through college .
Overall , I experienced a huge change in that my mac runs pretty fast compared to my old PC .
It is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed .
This thing sucks !
Overall though , for the money spent it 's a great deal .
it has all the features that we expected and the price was good , working well so far .
I 've been impressed with the battery life and the performance for such a small amount of memory .
I Have been a Pc user for a very long time now but I will get used to this new OS .
It 's face and depanable .
To me it 's a workhorse ... and quiet as can be ... you even save big bucks not dishing out any extra to Uncle Sam ... Definite Buy ...
SO of course this one came through with the awesomeness !
* 4 weeks after giving the computer for repair * - Annoyed at MacHouse Amsterdam , decided to send complaint email to Apple .
I 'm pleased .
It did not have all the features I expected it to have .
After way too many times sending the thing in for repairs ( delivery service was slow , and without the laptop I had no access to the internet , and thus no way of tracking it to find out when I might hope to see my computer again ) , it finally kicked the bucket after just over 2 years .
The OS is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly .
Great things come in small " packages .
Most laptops and notebooks are difficult to key on .
Of course , I inspected the other netbooks and clearly their hinges are tighter and I even demonstrate the difference between my netbook and others .
It was quite easy .
It 's so useable and responsive .
The hard drive crashed as well , and I had to buy a new power cord .
I have used a couple of others on the job as well .
My first problem was with the pre-loaded Norton Firewall/Security program .
I was said it 's videocard .
* = Webcam is a bit laggy , not the greatest .
The letter A stopped working after the first week .
It was heavy , bulky , and hard to carry because of the size .
when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase .
After that I turned to email in my next vain help to get them to acknowledge that the warranty was still valid .
I bought for my son in the 2nd grade .
It 's not a wear-and-tear issue , not due to user carelessness and most importantly , they CA N'T guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and I have to accept the outcome .
This is my second MacBook .
This computer I used daily nice compact design .
Currently if I use the laptop I ca n't sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs .
tried windows 8 and hated it !!!
Now mainboard is broken , have to wait for a new one .
Anyway , in early July of this year , the DVD burner stopped working , and the computer stared having issues with power supply .
They said that my computer was covered on an extended warranty , and that products with extended warranties are taken care of through third parties and not Sony itself anymore .
For the price and what I get out of it has exceeded my expectations .
I 'm excited to learn more about what this powerful machine has to offer and encourage others to do the same .
Battery life needs more life .
Hmmm - that high failure rate sure is n't reflected in the retail price .
At first it 's like you 're in that honeymoon stage with your laptop .
Newegg 's RMA service was great as always , I contacted them late Friday night , and they issued me an RMA number and a PrePaid UPS shipping label the very next morning on Saturday .
Summary : Dont buy HP .
If you ask me , for this price it should be included .
After much battling with HP i was able to return it 4 times for repairs .
Let 's just get this out of the way , I love Apple !
Its fast , easy to use and it looks great .
Adjust the sensitivity since it 's not that responsive to begin with .
Probbly the worst decision we ever made !
4gb of ram ...
The feel of this machine compared to the old MacBook is far superior .
The newer black keyboard took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick , but it is still a great notebook !
Besides being elegant , the MacBooks are durable .
I am forever changed and will no longer buy a Windows based machine for personal use .
Just for a stupid CD .
The newer MacBook that I have purchased is one of the best computers .
and it comes with the new OSX that comes with new features that makes the use more easy .
However , you have to adjust yourself to what it will do , not what you want it to do .
I only used it to browse the internet and and I dont know how many times it has spontaniously shut down and it is just a blank screen now .
It is easy to find documents , and keep them in one area .
It is a big big , but since it has a 18.4 " screen what would you expect !
That is pretty sad when they name them specifically .
From the moment I opened the box to the present it has been a great joy .
I am just ONE of the million customers .
It 's shiny and it 's pretty .
It 's graphics are n't bad at all , for the lower end of the MacBook Pro spectrum , easily capable of running StarCraft II and other games with comparable graphics .
So this was great for me .
( If you ever see the spinning beachball come up when you think it should n't , check the " Activity Monitor " app to see if the disk throughput has temporarily dropped to zero .
Great wifi too .
They refuse .
Also consider the MS Office apps are all trial versions , hope you have your own copies .
My sisters same laptop broke about the month later for the same reason .
I LOVE IT !
Sony , Acer , Dell , Packard Bell and Toshiba .
Then I 've fixed the DC jack ( inside the unit ) , rewired the DC jack to the OUTside of the laptop , replaced the power brick .
- Called headquarters again , they report that TFT panel is broken , should be fixed by the end of the week ( week 3 ) .
Great battery , speed , display .
Within 3 weeks the same issues started happening AGAIN .
Sure , the initial out of pocket expense is greater , but that should not dissuade anyone from the fact that these machines run like none other on the planet , and when I factor in all the money in that I wasted on Geek Squad and the latest patches to de-corrupt my infested PCs , it probably comes out about even anyhow .
without having to have extra equipment and/or complicated routes to take to be able to do so .
It took Toshiba tech support 4 calls and 4 different techs to correct the problem .
The price is 200 dollars down .
The netbook is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me .
The majority of the reviews seem to be for the 13.3 MacBook Pro Model # MD101LL/A .
I love it and the change in lifestyle that came with it .
Could n't have asked for more !
Had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in .
When I got it , I immediately noticed that it was quite heavy and thick and not really attractive .
I finally own a piece of computing equipment that I do n't want to take a baseball bat and destroy .
I returned the 2nd laptop for a full refund .
I am ADDICTED to photo booth !
I will never go back to Windows !
For me , keys were starting to get stuck and would n't type very well .
This is the third MacBook Pro in our family .
It has a overheating issue - nearly to the point of being dangerous .
then on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east .
If this is an improvement in Customer Service then I would hate too see what it was before !
Design : very durable .
I would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of grabage .
I would rate this computer at 5 stars , but considering it has a short life span I can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine .
Has met or exceeded my needs for a compact travel device .
My bag just got a little lighter .
I had the same reasons as most PC users : the price , the overbearing restrictions of OSX and lack of support for games .
There is no " tools " menu .
What can I say , It 's an Apple .
Also , I have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly .
The little battery that it did have would only last about an hour while just having it on the desktop .
This hardware seems to be better than the iMac in that it is n't $ 1400 and smaller .
Pay attention to the specs if you want these options .
I 've had a Toshiba laptop in the past ;
i think that anyone looking for a good durrable laptop then this is the way to go .
I have never had it crash , randomly turn off ,
I will never go back to a PC again !
I can say that I am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied .
They are about the same size keys .
OS X is solid with lots of innovations such as quicklook which save heaps of time .
Garageband is more for the musicians , and the laptop is equipped with a good working microphone , good enough for beginners and musicians at the intermediate level .
Purchased as a gift for a friend .
Screen is bright and gorgeous .
Although my model was listed as recalled , HP denied my claim .
The applications are also very easy to find and maneuver , much easier than any other computer I have ever owned .
I bought it to use in college and it is perfect .
I mainly use it for email , internet , and managing personal files ( pics , vids , etc. ) .
The battery life was shorter than expected .
I loved it then , but unfortunately it was before the days of wireless internet .
Great pick for portability and affordability .
I am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook , it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop .
Great value , fast delivery - Computer works as if brand new , no problems , very pleased
Its not just slow on the internet , its slow in general .
After a little more than a year of owning my MacBook Pro , the monitor has completely died .
It rarely works and when it does it 's incredibly slow .
I do n't do any high tech stuff on it , just write papers , check mail , and sometimes play games , so I ca n't reccomend it if you are in the computer field .
So this is very good commputer and i highly suggest it .
Once you get past learning how to use the poorly designed Windows 8 Set-Up you may feel frustrated .
HAVING HAD EXPERIENCE WITH A TOSHIBA LAPTOP , I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT THE TOSHIBA NB305 LAPTOP HAS MAJOR PROBLEMS .
I highly recommend this product !
Well , I had completed the presentation in powerpoint the night before on my PC , but took the Apple to the conference .
After fumbling around with the OS I started searching the internet for a fix and found a number of forums on fixing the issue .
I have had no luck with staples or HP to resolve this problem .
I 'm glad I bought this laptop , it was worth the few ( $ 100 ) extra dollars .
so the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault .
Unfortunately , Apple 's quality has continued to slide .
A longer battery life would have been great - but it meets it 's spec quite easily .
The battery does n't last long but I 'm sure an upgrade battery would solve that problem .
It is SO much fun to play with .
It 's very annoying .
Also , the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it .
The display is beyond horrible .
So this review might be a tad bit bias .
On 3 July 2004 , I purcased this model at Best Buy for about $ 150
It is very fast and has everything that I need except for a word program .
I then upgraded to Mac OS X 10.8 " Mountain Lion " .
for two months , when YOU GUESSED IT .
But if you 're willing to pay another 200 dollar for a windows disc .
Very annoying .
Also , because of the size and consistancy of the laptop computer , some websites would n't even attempt to work on the computer because of browser problems .
In my house , HP is a nasty word .
Yes , they cost more , but they more than make up for it in speed , construction quality , and longevity .
There is nothing better .
After that the said it was under warranty .
this is my second one and the same problem , bad video card unreliable overall , this will be my second time returning this laptop back to best buy .
The only problem is a lack of screen resolutions !
By week two , my laptop had overheated and was completely dead even though I did not use it too much .
So , I must say I am not a happy camper .
I will NEVER buy ( Refurbished ) again , I do n't cae how cheap it is .
NOW AM VERY APREHENSIVE ABOUT TOSHIBA LAPTOPS .
Strengths : Well-shaped Weaknesses : A bad videocard !
Ca n't wait until I go on vacation and take it with me .
Very dissappointed becase I have had toshibas for years , and never a issue .
PC never worked right even after BIOS fixed .
Turns out this is a common problem .
Considering another computer should be out of the question
She said its very user friendly .
this is quite smooth as well as heavy and can easily slip through the hands .
I had it four months when my disc drive refused to open .
All the ports are much needed since this is my main computer .
It 's fast , light , and is perfect for media editing , which is mostly why I bought it in the first place .
I really wanted a Mac over a pc because I used a Mac in high school .
All of the programs ( Keynote , Pages , Numbers ) have an option to save your documents as Microsoft compatible , which really eliminates the need for the actual .
After 3 pleasant weeks of use , the laptop just died .
The screen gets smeary and dusty very quickly and it 's very noticeable .
I am really heartbroken to have to post a terrible review .
I love a " pc " but I was ready for a change and tired of the windows system .
The battery life is excellent - 6-7 hours without charging .
Spent 2 hours on phone with HP Technical Support .
This is a great laptop and I would recommend it to anyone .
This is especially disheartening when Apple prides itself as the choice of creative professionals .
I needed a new computer for graduate school ( had never owned a laptop before ) , and the only reason I did n't purchase a Mac was because my school 's website strongly recommended students purchase PCs .
Took a while to clean it up to my specs .
So far , it 's an average laptop - no better , no worse than the HP I replaced .
I enjoy having apple products .
The screen is framed by half - to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary , reduces the screen size and increases the bulk .
I sit down and use my husband 's work PC and I do n't like it one bit .
Although I was promised about 10 hours , I found myself to a limited 7 hours ( which is still amazing ) .
I could have purchased a cheap computer to do what I 'm doing now !
The display is awesome .
I 'm pretty sure when I bought it , my bank account went ' ouch !
I love the Apple products .
I have had a total of 5 different laptop from many different manufactures .
I respond that I do not have the old computer ...
it is hard to fix and makes it a hassle to own one .
Have one myself and Love it !
It has plenty of memory , lots of hard drive , and great graphics .
compresses itself and you ca n't use it .
I thought that it will be fine , if i do some settings .
Best Buy Rocks !
It 's small but powerful , light but strong , elegant and beautiful ... In resume : it 's a Mac !
One of them seems to have worked .
Another included program that is laughable is the chess game .
But you must get the 15 inch .
Pretty much made sense to get a Mini .
At first , I feel a little bit uncomfortable in using the Mac system .
My kids ( and dogs ) destroyed two power cords by pulling on them .
This is not Best Buy 's fault .
I go to purchase it on line , and I find out that the device will not be available until almost two months later !
Its pretty fast and does not have hiccups while I am using it for web browsing , uploading photos , watching movies ( 720p ) on occasion and creating presentations .
Battery is lasting about 6 hours as I am surfing the web on Sundays while checking football scores and watching funny Youtube videos .
Cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones/mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction .
With all the goodies inside this machine , it is a value .
If you want more information on macs I suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications .
I took it back for an Asus and same thing - blue screen which required me to remove the battery to reset .
You will fall in love with it in no time .
I am first time Mac Buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the Mac offers .
I do n't want to RUN a computer ; I want to USE a computer .
I first purchased this Dell model " 1764 " on April 6 , 201
There are so many wonderful features and benefits to the new MacBook !
Before i bought my new i5 , I did my research for about 2 weeks and determined to move for HP to Apple for reliability , dependable , and long lasting operations .
Great Performance and Quality .
My sister is the electronics manager at Wal Mart and she says that HP is the best .
Okay , let 's just start out by saying I am in no way a computer techy .
Was disappointed to find out that the model had been discontinued , apparently because of known motherboard problems .
Plus stylish .
The only thing I dislike about this laptop are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the computer for grip .
It bluescreened on me without any warning , running simply basic Chrome .
The capabilities using that program alone made me want a Mac .
Speakers too small to be of any real use .
Two of the times was in one month .
This mac is great !
I love the size , keyboard , the functions .
Then HP sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up , not able to connect .
Though you get a polite person , you often don t get a solution .
Returned laptop for a 4th repair and it came back but now would lock up and randomly reboot frequently making the laptop unusable .
I recommend the Macbook Pro if you want the best laptop on the market .
on the bright side at least I was n't without my laptop for long this time !
i give this laptop a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me .
They are not .
ASUS has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks , and I would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them .
The So called laptop Runs to Slow and I hate it !
overall i would recomend this to anybody and tell them that if they want to burn their music or play there video games to buy the cd drive .
It is the perfect size and speed for me .
Shiny This Laptop is the Best of the best !
Dealing with the support drone on the other end of the chat was sheer torture .
" This is n't a big deal , I have n't noticed the issue with DVDs or other media , only through USB output .
Apple is always great about the aesthetics of things , they always come up with good looking products .
After the first few months , the computer started crashing about every week .
After all was said and done , I essentially used that $ 450 savings to buy 16GB of RAM , TWO Seagate Momentus XT hybrid drives and an OWC upgrade kit to install the second hard drive .
There also seemed to be a problem with the hard disc as certain times windows loads but claims to not be able to find any drivers or files .
I know some people complained about HDMI issues but they released a firmware patch to address that issue .
This is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine ;
i would have to say that overall its great !
However , a NETBOOK will be a different story .
Even out of warranty !
The graphics are great .
I bought this laptop Was the worst Laptop I 've ever bought .
the mouse pad and buttons are the worst i 've ever seen .
I was taught to use Photoshop and was amazed .
I will be patient for few months .
The configuration is perfect for my needs .
We figure that after everything HIS pc actually ended up costing $ 350 more than my original Mac .
However , there are MAJOR issues with the touchpad which render the device nearly useless .
Navigation through the computer is far superior compared to Windows operating systems , as well .
Delivery was early too .
Not a scratch or mark on it .
I like it !
I was originally concerned that I could n't view work I had done in college on my Mac because of the PC formatting , but I was even more thrilled to learn of programs like iLife and iWork that allow you to convert your PC documents into readable files on Macs .
Also kinda loud when the fan was running .
The Nortons virus scan is only for a very short time unlike others that usually are good for a year .
They are so realistic I am just speechless .
My computer was one of the best in the school compared to my fellow classmates .
Its white color is stylish for college students and easy to take to carry and take to classes .
Or the cursor would show up some place else .
I spoke with a service rep at Micro Center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her power adapter , so it 's not just an isolated incident !!!
Which is what I did , check out my ACER 5517 !
It would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required .
but it has a major design flaw .
Other Thoughts : Do not purchase this product .
I also love the small , convenient size of my laptop , making it a perfect tool for my academic studies .
There is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle , and when I click on it it says : " Consider replacing your battery " and it does not hold full charge .
And if you have a iphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to it at high speed .
Back then my entire family was Devoted to the Sony name .
So buyer beware when buying Toshiba
You may soon mistake my digitus medius as a lively pogo stick .
PDF files can be viewed instantly .
Summary : HP knew they were shipping out bad BIOS and did nothing proactive to resolve it .
So needless to day , I 'm not happy .
The price is higher than most lab top out there ; however , he/she will get what they paid for , which is a great computer .
The MacBook Pro is very sturdy and versatile .
User friendly , fast and high tech It is amazing !
I Contacted HP about this situation and was given excuses , without results .
This is by far thee best , most reliable computer I could find .
The video card is great for media , and above average for gaming , but not a gamers first choice .
I 'm definitely not hard on laptops and guarantee 100 % that no liquid has touched this machine in my presence .
Once again , I was told it was the suspicious power supply problem .
After 4 days , being denied 6 times and told off once , I managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt .
I 've had the MacBook Pro 15 for about three weeks , and it really is a great computer .
was a great deal i will give that .
MAYBE The Mac OS improvement were not The product they Want to offer .
THIS is what a laptop is supposed to be .
It is robust , with a friendly use as all Apple products .
IT IS TRASH !
It has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard !
Thank you .
i asked many people , search on the net and also read reviews here in best buy .
What 's also interesting is this survey changed my ratings the first time I submitted it in case it does n't keep what I put here are my aratings
In short , you could say your mac could become your best friend ( no intention of replacing Rover your dog ) .
Can you buy any laptop that matches the quality of a MacBook ?
It is also fast as can be ... you get what you pay for ... well worth the investment
Its a dog plain and simple .
the mcbook pro notebook will make it easy for you to write and read your emails at blazing speeds .
I wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused , because they knew it was trouble .
As usual at customer service center , she asked me to hold for a moment while she went to the back-office and compare it with other same model netbooks and discussed it with her colleague ( I could see them ) .
My main reason to convert was the imovie program .
I should have been more observant .
The cool thing about this is anyone can use it .
I dual boot with Linux and that other security-prone OS and it performs flawlessly .
The laptop was returned but audio issue was not fixed .
I am an Info Sys major in college , so I started researching this issue on my own .
And that probably explains why I 've already had my SATA controller go bad within a year of buying it .
Of course , I also have several great software packages that came for free including iWork , GarageBand , and iMovie .
Keyboard is great , very quiet for all the typing that I do .
Simple to use , and great graphics .
Next , most Acer laptop fans are on the bottom which is right on your laptop .
I find it not to be very user friendly .
I think it was around 16 hundred bucks last I checked .
My opinion of Sony has been dropping as fast as the stock market , given their horrible support , but this machine just caused another plunge .
Windows Vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service .
even though I had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty .
in May I started having problems with the USB ports not working .
After replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working ( 3 months of use ) which was frustrating .
I waited another month for approval and for them to " BUILD " me a new laptop .
It is well worth the money it cost , Very good investment .
The MacBook Pro is a great product which can meet the needs of the average consumer .
Boots up fast and runs great !
also it is light weight compared to others .
The case is now slightly larger than the previous generation , but the lack of an external power supply justifies the small increase in size .
I have had nothing but problems since the day I took it out of the box !
The price premium is a little much , but when you start looking at the features it is worth the added cash .
, which Apple does n't offer , is why I bought my MacBook at Best Buy .
Really like the textured surface which shows no fingerprints .
The software is amazing .
I picked it out because it was inexpensive ( $ 400 ) and I thought it would be a good , easy to use first laptop .
I own other Macs but always find myself navigation to the MacBook Pro to get my work done .
I am also upset with CR for giving a good rating .
My last laptop was a 17 " ASUS gaming machine , which performed admirably , but having since built my own desktop and really settling into the college life , I found myself wanting something smaller and less cumbersome , not to mention that the ASUS had been slowly developing problems ever since I bought it about 4 years ago .
Later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months .
The great 18 month same as cash financing and Advance Protection Plan which includes accidents like spills .
the hardware problems have been so bad , i ca n't wait till it completely dies in 3 years , TOPS !
When I got my laptop back after this first instance it worked okay for a little bit then I started expeirencing issues again , everything from programs and drivers failing again , to it powering off for no reason , to locking up and freezing and just all sorts of issues .
Stupidly , mind-numbingly slow -- then I found it can only be loaded with 2GB * maximum * .
I got the first " Blue screen of death " in the early part of July .
My sister has the same Mac as me and she is in a band and uses GarageBand to record and edit .
Buy this .
Basic computer .
The only problems are the sound isnt very loud I have to wear headphones .
Cheaper than buying it @ apple too !
THE MOTHERBOARD IS DEAD !
i would never go back any more , i love this computer so much and i would recommend it to everyone .
Now I have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the Mac !
3D rendering slows it down considerably .
Fast , fast and fast , the web pages just fly by .
Not easy to carry .
The notebook would not turn back on again .
Finally was able to reach a young lady in California and ordered the machine and was subsequently given a delivery date .
Great product .
I dont understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing .
I do find that my MacBook has a lot more bells and whistles than a normal PC especially if you enjoy technology , downloading pictures and graphic design .
Before we got this laptop , had a compaq pasaro for 5 years with no problems .
I got this laptop on Black Friday .
The Bluetooth was not there at all , and the fingerprint reader driver would be there , but the software would hang after installation was 1/2 way done .
It 's so nice to look at and the keys are easy to type with .
Awesome form factor , great battery life , wonderful UX .
I think this computer is super lame .
For the not so good , I got the stock screen - which is VERY glossy .
I am a freelance graphic artist .
Love that it does n't take up space like a regular computer .
Besides , the apple stocks have been falling due to lack of sales .
Eventually my battery would n't charge , so unless I had it plugged in it would n't even power on .
The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely .
While it was highly rated , would I like it ? I tried the keyboard at the store , and it seemed ok .
I own a Hewlett Packard laptop and I 've had man problems with it since I bought in in Feb , 201
Yes , that 's a good thing , but it 's made from aluminum that scratches easily .
It is a great size and amazing windows 8 included !
Who makes a laptop that ca n't rest on your lap ?
That is how it is able to function better than any other PC .
Also , macbooks come with much more features which are so cool !
We use the built in tools often , iTunes is open nearly every day and works great with my iPhone .
The Windows 7 Starter is , in my opinion , a great way to think about using your netbook : basics , basics , basics .
But sitting on a lap or on a desk in front of you it looks more than big enough ( this could be because Im used to my Lenovo 10 tablet now ) plus this is a great size if I want to unplug the external keyboard , mouse , and monitor to take it with me when I take photos and video .
The graphics are stunning .
( 3DMARK6 score is only 8500 ) .
We love the size of the screen , although it is still lightweight and very easy to tote around .
I was sorly disapointed to discover that HP ( what I thought was a reputable company ) would n't honor the warrenty when the fan blade fell apart .
i tried turning it done but it did nothing .
After using it for over a month , an issue started to surface .
They really do have the worlds very worst repair service .
So , I thought why not give Mac Book pro a try .
My kids have to take their PCs in once a year to have them " de-bugged " .
I would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front .
Buy this if you like being tortured , teased , frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old Mac .
Recently there are a few incidents that annoy the hell out of me .
The right speaker did not work .
Biggest complaint is Windows 8 .
although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks .
the only problem is that i had to add 1 gb RAM , the computer was kinda slow .
The macbook rarely requires a hard reboot .
I respond that I do not have the old computer and this way I would lose the data on my hard drive .
Overall very impressed , Thank you Apple and Amazon !
I 'm not going to lie , I 've never really liked the Acer brand in general .
Who knows what will happen later on when they dismantle the whole damn thing ? So , I said I wanted a new set .
Runs real quick .
Either way I 'm furious .
This unit is not .
I have never had an experience like this .
All I can say is I am impressed .
I 've had this laptop for about a month now .
I had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty .
The other day I had a presentation to do for a seminar at a large conference in town - lots of people , little time to prep and have to set up a computer to a projector , etc .
I have just had to learn to be a little harder typer than on my last computer .
Maybe it 's Acer , maybe it 's MSFT .
Although the price is higher then Dell laptops , the Macbooks are worth the dough .
For the use it was purchased for it is a good Laptop .
The 17 inch screen is very large , but the computer is very light .
I had to call HP and ask for a recovery disk because the computer does not come with one and completely redo it all .
Sometimes you really have to tap the pad to get it to worki
It works great and I am so happy I bought it .
They also have a longer service life than other computers ( I have several friends who still use the older Apple PowerBooks ) .
When I finally had everything running with all my software installed I plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed .
Of course , for a student , weight is always an issue .
they improved nothing else such as Resolution , appearance , cooling system , graphics card , etc .
It still heats up like mad and I am unable to use it with the computer directly on my lap for more than five to ten minutes at a time .
What can I say .
I took it back for a full refund .
" > iPhoto is probably the best program I have ever worked with : easy and convenient .
The Apple engineers have not yet discovered the delete key .
Ca n't close the 2nd HDD bay since there are brackets you have to break off ( even then , it still does n't shut ) That could be a major flaw for the dual HDD user .
I absolutely love my mac !
I can have both OSX and Windows XP running at the same time !
The apple systems are over priced luxurys that ar n't worth what they are being charged for , this model 's specifications are far from being impressive and they only thing you get out of this is the apple name .
There are differences that you need to know and take time to learn .
It seems to have some opions that are intalled but do not work like I thought they would .
When I called Toshiba , they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $ 35 for the phone call , even though they did n't offer any technical support .
It also does not have bluetooth .
I got a mac as my HS graduation gift .
I will never buy another HP computer .
It easily fits into most computer bags but does n't weigh down a backpack or satchel when being carried with spirals and/or textbooks .
After about another month I had to send it in AGAIN to Acer for repairs .
It 's a joke .
and its really cheap and you wont regret buying it .
Also , I issued a replacement RMA for a few dead pixels in the upper zone of the screen , which is noticable to me .
I just recently had to ship my laptop back to HP for repair .
I purchased a MacBook Pro and this to replace a couple of HP units that I was using .
It fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and I have never had any issues with it freezing .
Dell sucks
Seems like maybe a bad shipment from Toshiba .
Great overall .
The 4 USB ports are nice , but the two on the side only work now and then .
I have found a lot of online sources to help me but think that I would have learned a lot quicker if I would have taken the class .
- Apple offers to send replacement and after 10 days I send them the old computer .
So then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back , but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened , and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the repair ( the price of a new one ) .
Very happy with my 7th Toshiba laptop !
So , buyers beware !
Problem fixed which is great but there went another two weeks without my laptop at school .
I did contact HP and share how unhappy I am .
I am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great !
Fits all my personal needs .
I could not handle it one hand like I can the replacement computer I purchased .
and the speakers is the worst ever .
I like it so much , I bought another just for my wife .
Does everything I wanted this laptop to do .
I 'm going back to DELL .
The apple MacBook is the best investment that I have ever made .
do a quick search on the internet see if im the only one .
Processor - When compared to my 3 week old Early 2011 edition there I barely experience any difference in performance ( 2.3 GHz v/s 2.4 GHz ) .
It was a laugh too !
Memory is upgradable .
It 's just what we were looking for and it works great .
It 's A MAC !!
The computer would not ever cut back on .
Easy learning curve .
And inconvenient !
I also enjoy the fact that my MacBook Pro laptop allows me to run Windows 7 on it by using the VMWare program .
I had less problems .
previous laptops were pc 's , still have them , but the mac osx is a clean and smooth operating system .
It is everything I 'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint , but somehow a bit more sturdy .
User upgradeable RAM and HDD .
I had to install Mountain Lion and it took a good two hours .
I my wife is also now the proud owner of a Macbook as well !
It 's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook .
So far , I have no complaints .
My Iphone synced right up just like a person would expect , unlike the PCs in our lives .
I have n't tried the one with retina display ... Maybe in the future .
Does a great job with video shot on a Canon 5D MKII .
I 've had hp desktop for over 4 yrs now and not one days goes by that i do n't regret buying it .
I personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers .
Apple did a great job .
Love the graphics , awesome programs ( including Garageband ) , and really cool default background .
this laptop is durable and it is easy to travel with .
Obviously one of the most important features of any computer is the " human interface .
it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once .
I have had several machines over the years , both for personal and business use .
I returned the computer to HP and they kept it for 3 months .
We were occasional Mac users before , but most recently owned a budget PC since it is what we could afford .
I told them that I just received my brand new MacBook but I was having issues .
This wiped out several programs that were installed on the computer when it was bought .
Thank God for " ctrl Z " Bottom line , I 've been using laptops since the mid 90s and probably the majority of brands out there .
This was my first MacBook purchase ever .
Beta had better quality , but VHS became the industry standard .
It is lightweight and the perfect size to carry to class .
WIth the upgraded memory , the MacBook Pro never has an issue running many many applications at once !
I bought this laptop so that the entire family had a computer in the living room ;
It was over rated !
Good keyboard , long battery life , largest hard drive and windows 7 .
I challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it .
I would never buy a Dell again .
It 's all a bit magical .
the battery is irreplaceable .
High price tag , however .
Features like the font are very block-like and old school .
Instead , I 'll focus more on the actual performance and feature set of the hardware itself so you can make an educated decision on which Mac to buy .
But until now , no complains at all .
It was so exciting for me to unwrapp my new mac .
All for such a great price .
To those thinking about switching , do it and do not look back !
I highly recommend that you buy this product .
All the customers that come in hate Dell .
The Macbook pro 's physical form is wonderful .
This system came loaded with Windows 7 Starter .
My MacBook Pro has been a huge disappointment .
So what if the laptops/mobile phones look chic and cool ? The after sales support is terrible .
As with any laptop not purchased with software options , it comes with a lot of what I consider useless applications .
NO STAR FOR THIS TRASH . [ ...
I do n't use my laptop in a way though that needs a long battery life so it 's perfect for me .
Almost 4 years ago I bought what was then the current , up to date HP Pavilion -- If I recall correctly , it was the dv 1300 t.
I shipped out on Saturday , July 17 .
You wo n't be disappointed .
Also the display is exceptional !
tons of bloatware and junk programs .
I got this one for thanks giving Offer for $ 962 :) .
It 's solid .
Amazing product as you would expect from Apple .
I took it in to the Apple store and guess what ? They fixed it , no cost out of pocket .
The battery has never worked well .
I or my dad paid over twenty four hundred dollars for everything .
- Stay away from MacHouse Amsterdam .
Three weeks after I bought the netbook , the screen quit working .
MacBook Notebooks quickly die out because of their short battery life , as well as the many background programs that run without the user 's knowlede .
Summary : Spend your money elsewhere
Being only 2 months old , I am not a happy camper !
The reality was , it heated up very quickly , and took way too long to do simple things , like opening my Documents folder .
Buy the separate RAM memory and you will have a rocket !
upon giving them the serial number the first thing I was told , was that it was out of warranty and I could pay to have it repaired .
I guess the only good thing that came out of these were the speakers and the subwoofer .
for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is .
It was secure and easy to navigate .
It has a faster processor and more ram .
If you get a lemon ( I have two thirds of my Macs ) , you have to send it in for repairs several times before they will replace it , even if they have numerous problems with the same version of their computers .
STOPPED BOOTING UP less than a week after my one-year warranty was up .
If you check you will find the same notebook with the above missing ports and a dual core AMD or Intel processor .
No Viruses !
Still pretty pricey , but I 've been putting off money for a while as a little Macbook Fund , and finally got to use it .
I believe that the quality of a mac is worth the price .
It was at my door in less than 24 hours .
My HP is very heavy .
Good in every aspect .
I have found also , it is very easy to be able to access wireless internet access ;
The leather carrying case , keyboard and mouse arrived in two days from Memphis warehouse .
My laptop worked again for just a while before I started having issues AGAIN .
It is as good as new .
Satisfy what I paid for it .
Have n't regretted it one bit .
Its also FUN to use !
I think just going from PC to Mac has gotten me totally spoiled and I ca n't imagine ever going back .
One of the wonderful things about Macs is that they are virus free .
One of the primary reasons why I purchased an IPad was to store photographs so that I could show to my customers .
The cover for the DVD drive soon came off , too -- a mark of poor construction quality .
Two , owning a 17 in.mac book gives the flexibility to sit anywhere you want without worry about bother anyone .
Seems to me that 's the best way to get Apple 's attention .
It has everything you need to get the job done .
Set up was a breeze .
And this is n't just my one experine .
They 're absolutely useless , unless you count the joy of releasing anger while smashing into little peices against the wall .
They are by far the easiest systems to actually learn about computers with .
I was looking for something in between a regular laptop and a tablet and this is it .
It is absolutely horrible to use , despite all its so called advanced features .
Small enough to use on a long flight , Light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips .
Tech support tells me the latter problem is a power supply problem and have offered to fix it if it happens again .
Setting would change for some reason , the screen size would change on it 's own , like the pixel sizes and whatnot .
Sure it 's not light and slim but the features make up for it 100 % .
The Dell mini was the first Dell product that I had ever purchased .
With a mac you do n't have to worry about antivirus software or firewall , it 's so wonderful .
Very fast for my needs .
I started hainv problems with it within the first month .
I work as a designer and coder and I needed a new buddy to work with , not gaming .
After doing CAD work all day at work , using a higher end PC , I could n't come home and settle for the use of a lower end computer .
Not to mention , the battery life is absolutely amazing .
It 's outstanding too .
It 's great and we will always stick with Apple computers , we have been so happy with them .
Files as well would become lost , deleted or corrupted .
I was starting to boil .
Added an iMac about 2 years later .
" I 've had it now about 2 months and absolutely LOVE IT .
The computer loads in about a 1/10th of the time that my PC did , and I have all of the programs that were on my PC .
- got it back 3 months later
It was fast , and it was " different " .
But I wanted the Pro for the CD/DVD player .
Theres also iDVD , a program dedicated to putting all your favorite media together - photos , recordings , video projects into one program so that you can create the perfect memoir for your parents , family , siblings , and any other person important in your life that there may be .
No viruses .
But I do NOT like Win8 .
Second , it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated
Seems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications ( ie Internet tabs , programs , etc ) simultaneously .
you can find many laptops with the same performance and even better with lower price , but you can not find the look , easy , applications , and the experience in mac .
Its only crashed on me one time in the 3 months i 've had it .
I love it so much .
breaks easily .
I had finally reached my limit and broke down .
So you out of of notebook and money .
She told me flatly , " It 's like that one .
Moving from a PC to Mac has never been easier , and I 'm glad that I did it .
Crisp screen , great battery life , and plenty of storage .
Not sure how I recommend it for quality gaming , as I have a desktop rig for that reason .
So noise is reduced at least 50 % and the heat is much better , now it does n't feel hot but warm .
This little netboook is helping me get work done !
the manufacturer 's warranty only covers replacement/repair of parts .
The big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies , pictures and etc !
It is really easy to use and it is quick to start up .
its not bad just VERY VERY annoying .
Also , I have alot of trouble with it getting very hot , and not even sitting on anything to make it hot .
I already have a HP laptop I bought last year that 's standard size .
This is another reason to like the Mac .
It works really well .
I love this program , it is superior to windows movie maker .
Overall : Poor , Features : Average , Performance : Poor , Battery Life : Excellent , Price-Value : Poor
Performance is much much better on the Pro , especially if you install an SSD on it .
I have in the past gotten superfine sandpaper and " fixed " the edges by rounding them off .
I will never buy another computer from Dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how I was treated by the company .
The PhotoBooth is a great program , it takes very good pictures with the built-in camera .
For me I was lucky and a local store was selling them for $ 2000 off and Best Buy matched their price so I was able to buy one for under $ 1000
All in all , I 'm incredibly dissatisfied with this laptop , and with HP as a whole .
( For those old enough to remember , it is similar to Beta versus VHS .
It 's macbook pro and there is no discusion about it .
the mouse buttons are hard to push .
A coupla months later , they change my hard drive .
Do n't waste your money or time .
You may need to special order a bag .
Replaced this one with my mac that was stolen , its a great computer .
The neat and organized icon list is a welcome change from cluttered and confusing desktop icons .
Pretty disappointed about this product .
Do n't buy this model .
however , they were kind enough to send a replacement free of charge .
It is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an Alienware gaming machine .
They informed me that I had around 7 " policies " or viruses on it .
tech support would not fix the problem unless I bought your plan for $ 150 plus .
The item received was exactly as identified .
The Mac takes about the same amount of starting-up time as the average PC , but keeps itself cleaned up and ready to use .
I also bought one for my wife , and 3 for my office .
It quit working within a weeks time .
I do not like too much Windows 8 .
Simply amazing computer !!
Again in February my computer completely failed to the point that it could not load Windows so I contacted Acer to get it fixed thru my Warrenty and it took about 3 days fighting on the phone with agents and it seemed as though NONE of them spoke English .
As far as user type - I dabble in everything from games ( WoW ) to Photoshop , but nothing professionally .
So in late March , early April 2009 I was without it again for a couple weeks while I had online courses I had to complete and my fiance was in Afghanistan and web conferencing was the best communication method we had .
The most recent being that my Safari internet browser is freaking out on me , but I have just been using firefox instead .
A tip for people looking into this computer : DO NOT BUY IT save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last .
It could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have DDR5 instead of DDR3 .
The second issue I had with it occured a month later and it kept overheating , even if on for less than an hour !
I had to buy a wireless mouse to go with it , as I am old school and hate the pad , but knew that before I bought it , now it works great , need to get adjusted to the key board , as I am used to a bigger one and pounding .
So do n't get it .
I do n't have stupid pop up windows ( even when I have pop ups blocked ) , I do n't have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download , and best of all I can run all the web programming software I need to use all at once without slowing me down .
Best Buy laughed when I told them they should replace it instead of expecting me to be without a computer again for another couple of weeks .
Since the machine 's slim profile is critical to me , that was a problem .
The worst a Mac ever did to me was freeze up .
Yeah , of course smarty pants " fix it now " ) Software - Compared to the early 2011 edition I did see inbuilt applications crashing and it prompted me to send the report to Apple ( which I promptly did ) .
If you 're not wanting to be mobile , this is a good laptop to sit on a desk .
I practically have a new laptop with all the " fixes " they have done !
We both recently got new laptops .
I get a ton of compliments on its size , and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus , I can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you 're restricted to the width of your body for computing room .
If you find yourself in the market for a new laptop ( and have the money ) do n't exclude looking at the MBPs .
So far , so good !
I loaded windows 7 via Bootcamp and it works flawlessly !
It seems to be incompatible with everything else .
The first time I used the card reader it took half an hour and a pair of tweezers to remove the card .
I also liked the glass screen .
I am very happy with my first Mac .
Very long-life battery ( up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings ) .
That being said after 2 weeks of owning every time I start it up now it gives me a black screen for 5-8 seconds stating pxe-e61 media test error check cable .
There is NO way I will buy a LG product in the future .
I need graphic power to run my Adobe Creative apps efficiently .
I am overall very pleased with my toshiba satellite , I like the extra features , I love the windows 7 home premium .
Again .
This laptop has left me with a HORRIBLE taste in my mouth for Acer brand products .
This a starter notebook .
There was a little difficulty doing the migration as the firewire cable system ca n't be used with the iBook .
Got the computer back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it .
I could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat .
Honestly , I spent more time waiting for it to unfreeze then actually doing what I got on there for !
I was always against them but now I buying one I 'll never go back to PC .
The layout of the MacBook is horrible and confusing ;
My dad has one of the very first Toshibas ever made , yes its abit slow now but still works well and i hooked to my ethernet !
They are closed at 9pm eastern .
This netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop ( my wife and I have another laptop ) , or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks .
It has a very high performance , just for what I needed for .
My house is now 100 % Macbook .
I could n't believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge .
I noticed windows has a new system called Windows 7 , what about us Vista users ? They should get all the bugs out of Vista before investing in a new system .
I also own an HP notebook and it does n't even come close .
I purchased my first Mac and am glad I did .
I love the operating system and the preloaded software .
And the fact that it comes with an i5 processor definitely speeds things up
the retina display display make pictures i took years ago jaw dropping .
A cheaper price should not equal a " cheap " product .
Now they are believers in the product .
The battery life has not decreased since I bought it , so i 'm thrilled with that .
The computer was delivered as promised .
I still have that stupid bluetooth mouse to !
It 's fast , light , and simple to use .
But , buy this model and just purchase 4GB of RAM ( 2x2GB for $ 92 or 1x4GB for $ 99 ) , and save yourself $ 100 than the other model with 8GB of RAM .
The case is carved out of a single block of aluminum .
The only bad part is the size/weight .
I especially like the keyboard which has chiclet type keys .
I 've already recommended this laptop to a friend who eye 'd the computer when I took it out of my bag .
iLife is easily compatible with Microsoft Office so you can send and receive files from a PC .
Im glad that it has such great features in it .
My Mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary .
The backlit keys are wonderful when you are working in the dark .
I also love the design , the looks , the feel , and the my toshiba feature is wonderfull .
what an elegant , wonderful machine .
I got it back and my built-in webcam and built-in mic were shorting out anytime I touched the lid , ( mind you this was my means of communication with my fiance who was deployed ) but I suffered thru it and would constandly have to reset the computer to be able to use my cam and mic anytime they went out .
I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality !
It pretty much does everything we could ever need , and looks great to boot .
since then i have had minor problems with slow operation .
The buttons you have to press a little harder than most .
I am a full Mac convert now .
My wife was so excited to open the box , but quickly came to see that it did not function as it should .
The repairs were made quickly though I must say , however the second time they shipped it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me .
Is this partially due to the fact that it is running Windows Vista ?
I think that was a great decision to buy
The notebook is lacking a HDMI port and a S-video port that would enable one to hook it to a TV .
I like the operating system .
I bought it to be able to dedicate a small , portable laptop to my writing and was surprised to learn that I needed to buy a word processing program to do so .
Its pretty much fire it up and go .
However , my girlfriend realized that the netbook 's hinge is a bit loose ( when you open or close the LCD ) .
I have owned it only two months !
I bought this laptop for my son in 2007 for his Christmas present .
The memory was gone and it was not able to be used .
Far superior to my MacBook .
Perfect -- thanks so .
I will not be using that slot again .
I ca n't begin to say how disappointed I am .
Deal of the year .
It has a lot of memory and a great battery life .
Good for every day computing and web browsing .
My first laptop was an Acer that I got for Christmas .
However I dealt with this problem for over a year and it was more of a hastle then I have EVER had with anything .
This machine was a horrible experience .
I definitely will buy a Mac again if and when this computer ever fails .
It did n't come with any software installed outside of windows media , but for the price , I was very pleased with the condition and the overall product .
No installation disk ( DVD ) is included .
It is very durable , I am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet .
but it came back in even worse shape .
It 's great to have a solid Mac in the living room .
Please , anyone who is considering getting this computer , stop .
The " abuse " is that I pushed the power plug in too hard .
Apple continues to shine and provide a much more enjoyable computer experience !
Now the screen is going darker , darker , darker .
This is a nicely sized laptop with lots of processing power and long battery life .
The only thing I wish is the 15 inch MacBook Pro has much better speakers on the side of the keyboard .
I am however pleased that it is still hanging in there .
It 's the most wonderful thing in the entire world .
If you are a person like me , more on the creative side , the mac has something for you too .
It 's just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open .
Being a tech savvy , APPLE - product loving person , I 'm glad I finally got the MacBook Pro !
I BOUGHT THIS LAP TOP AND THE CHARGE TIME DOSE N'T LAST AS LONG AS THEY SAY IT WILL MORE LIKE 2 HOURS
I could n't afford a new mac , so I bought a PC instead .
I was n't really as concerned about portability ( it 's a very large laptop ) but it 's not hard to move around or take on a trip which was a pleasant surprise .
About 1/2 of the sites I need to visit because of my work contain some type of Flash .
Right size and weight for portability .
My Toshiba did not have sound on everything , just certain things .
Sorry Toshiba , but 1st impressions do count for something .
When I am at Starbucks between clients I get full bars on my HP and 1 bar on my Eee PC .
The technical support was not helpful as well .
Heck , I like all Mac computers , but they 're all WAY too pricey for the kind of economy the U.S. is going through .
EVENTUALLY we pushed hard enough to convince them that this was the MACHINE that was causing the problems .
I was looking for a mac which is portable and has all the features that I was looking for .
Perfect for all my graphic design classes I 'm taking this year in college : - )
During that time , I had to send it back 3 times .
I bought a HP Pavilion DV4-1222nr laptop and have had so many problems with the computer .
The laptop was very easy to set up .
The battery life is amazingly long at 7hrs and 5hrs if you use it .
With the needs of a professional photographer I generally need to keep up with the best specs .
I got it for Christmas , and I was so excited to set it up !
I am just amazed .
This laptop looked brand new and was shipped very quickly .
The magnetic plug-in power charging power cord is great ( I even put it to the test by accident ) - excellent innovation !
This laptop is a great buy .
They claim that I should be happy because I am getting a new laptop to replace my two-month old laptop .
I called back to ensure that received it , they had .
