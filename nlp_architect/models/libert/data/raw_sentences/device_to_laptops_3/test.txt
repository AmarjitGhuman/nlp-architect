I spoke to 4 different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a 5th person !
Very happy with my purchase .
They gave me a hard time yet again , but their was a malfunction in the battery itself , it did n't die .
Screen is crystal clear , yes it 's small - but it 's a netbook !
I got the blue screen of death the first month I got it .
( You may be reading one now !
I bought this laptop on Saturday and am completely in love with it !
might have to buy one for me now , since I use it all the time .
And if you do a lot of writing , editing is a problem since there is no forward delete key .
I am currently out of town and called to inform them the broken part would be returned when I got back in town .
pros : the macbook pro notebook has a large battery life and you wont have to worry to charge your laptop every five hours or so .
C'mon , LG .
But , like I said before , the only reason I do n't currently have a Mac laptop is because all of their laptops are too pricey .
As of a couple weeks ago the middle portion of the laptop from top to bottom , , , about 4 inches across is hardly visible .
This Macbook Pro is fast , powerful , and runs super quiet and cool .
Buy the Mac Mini it 's a terribly great machine .
Needs Power and Mouse Cable to Plug in back instead of side , In the way of operating a mouse in small area .
On my PowerBook G4 I would never use the trackpad I would use an external mouse because I did n't like the trackpad .
It is very well built .
He said quite a number of people had encountered this problem and said it is a common issue .
* 6th week * - They are not responding to my emails asking when they expect to dispatch the new unit ...
Nothing about it that i do n't love , apple always makes a great product .
The screen is a little glary , and I hated the clicking buttons , but I got used to them .
Be sure to have good air flow where ever you put it .
I did have to replace the battery once , but that was only a couple months ago and it 's been working perfect ever since .
I can not even read what I am writing half of the time .
In addition , all the design tools on Pages and Keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations .
If you are a PC user looking to convert I would HIGHLY recommend it !
The only thing I miss is that my old Alienware laptop had backlit keys .
I 've also had to have the keyboard replaced at my expense .
So having the AC plug go out on me and get lose or I could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good .
Have had many higher priced computers crash and burn long before ever got to use all that great memory and speed , etc .
It has a .1 ghz faster processor and a stock 500gb hard drive .
I gave it to my daughter because I just hated the screen , hated that it had no cd drive to at least play cd 's when I wanted to listen to music and do schoolwork .
The performance is definitely superior to any computer I 've ever put my hands on .
I let my friend borrow it , and she knows nothing about computers , and she used it with ease .
Luckily , for all of us contemplating the decision , the Mac Mini is priced just right .
Do n't get me wrong , I am no Microsoft hater , I 've just managed to turn into a much bigger Apple fan because of this machine .
Both my husband and I have this model Toshiba .
My Macbook was worth ( after 3 years of use ! ) $ 375 .
I got the Macbook and he got a Macbook Pro .
2 . The wireless card is low quality .
this laptop is great for work and doing my pictures .
Oh yea , has no numeric pad on the side .
I bought the netbook because it was smaller and lighter for me to carry around .
I 've tried going back to XL but there still problems .
When this happened I would have to completely power off my computer and restart it .
Should be there by the end of the week ( again ... ) .
Then 2 of my nephews were going into music and both fell in love with the MacBook Pro .
Two times with in one month .
I would recomend this acer to parents and grandparents it can really help them in school .
Not too much " junk " software to remove .
I dislike the weight and size , cubersome .
No problems , no lock ups , no disappointments .
Being virus-resistant is a huge plus .
So , I paid a visit to LG notebook service center at Alexandra Road , hoping they can make the hinge tighter .
It seemed to be a very nice laptop except I was not able to load my Garmin GPS software or Microsoft Office 2003 .
i dont understand why i spent twice as much to get a laptop rather than a desktop when my lap top is completely immoble .
If upgrade is possible to the full Windows 7 , then I will truly be a very happy geek .
I would definitely not go back to using a PC after using the mac .
I just got this laptop for college , and so far I am very happy with it .
As it turns out , I just did n't know any better .
The MacBook is way too overpriced for something so simple and chaotic .
I bought this Macbook Pro from Best Buy under a year ago to replace my old Macbook Air .
It makes sorting out all those photos on my digital camera a breeze , and organizing them by place , time taken , or sending them to an online print shop , or uploading them to Flickr or Facebook etc , is not hard at all .
You just lose a customer .
The criticism has waned , and now I 'd be the first to recommend an Air for truly portable computing .
the key bindings take a little getting used to , but have loved the Macbook Pro .
CONS : Price is a bit ridiculous , kinda heavy .
I tried out another Mac for a few months before buying this one and it is a great machine .
If you buy , pray you dont have major prolems .
The new os is great on my macbook pro !
The only pro to this computer is it was under $ 600 !
To list a few : They tend to get hot enough to cause 3rd degree burns , as well as ignite any flamable material if near the part that happens to heat up .
I would buy one of these for every person in my office if I could .
I would Highly recommend this MacBook .
I guess he was the technical person .
But it may be potentially hundreds or thousands in the near future .
Getting the Apple Care plan is a must .
The new Macbook Pro 15 inch i7 is nothing short of amazing .
How Toshiba handles the repair seems to vary , some folks indicate that they were charged for even an intial fix , others had the repair done 5 times .
I have had laptops in the past and I thought why not give these small netbooks a try .
This computer literally takes about five minutes to start up and to be able to use without it crawling and I DO mean crawling .
Such as PAGES , NUMBERS , and so on .
Also stunning colors and speedy
When my Dell laptop gave up only after 2 1/2 years , I decided to buy MacBook Pro .
Most everything is fine with this machine : speed , capacity , build .
THis computer may be small but it is one heck of a power horse .
I got it back again and was told the motherboard had been replaced , so I was now on the SECOND motherboard within 3 months .
While the computer seems to be set up in a common sense way rather than in geek-speak , there are certain quirks that can drive you crazy trying to deal with the PC world .
The battery life is also relatively good .
You will need them if you want to reload the OS ( I recommend doing if you can to start fresh and optimal ) .
This computer was so challenging to carry and handle .
I bought this laptop and found its TAB is not functioning .
With in weeks of purchasing my computer is began to slow down .
Overall , this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from .
NO more Lenovo for me .
I ca n't say enough good for it !
I wish iWork or MS Office came with the Mac , but MS Office does n't even come with most pc laptops .
Apple hit a home run here .
So I called customer support ( which is good too ) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all , I just chose to hide the message .
Posted Nov 8 , 2010 - Two weeks ago I bought this notebook .
Guess I 'll stay away from HP .
the mouse is way way way to sensitve .
it was a tough choice .
Unless you need the Bluetooth 3 .
apple and quess what , you have to send the whole laptop in , too bad , so sad
returned it to walmart .
But with A WAY Bigger Screen , and IS able to connect to an HDMI .
They say it could be the motherboard again , but Dell
the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one .
I have only had PCs with Windows before so this takes a little getting use to .
I wanted to explore what the Mac was all about .
I highly recommend this laptop to anybody that wants great performance from a laptop and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your laptop out the door .
Fast , great visual !
I had purchased it from a major electronics store and took it to their service department to find out what the problem was .
This is the first laptop I 've owned , althougth I used several at my previous job .
He loves it and it is easy to use and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started .
ASUS said my net-book was working properly .
Does exactly what I bought it 4 .
My wife also has problems with her Asus - different model .
Not as fast as I would have expect for an i5 .
I 'm already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown .
( I had been a Windows/Linux user before this ) I love the size because the screen is big enough for what I use it for ( Internet , artwork ) , and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable .
The unibody design is edgy and durable .
I swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one .
however , I may have inadvertently thrown out one of the batteries with the shipping carton .
The extended warranty for the $ 4000 and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu .
Also , you wo n't have to worry about them going onlne a getting a virus .
This laptop serves all my needs .
I called apple and no solution .
This system is not worth the money or trouble trying to get it fix .
In summary , take your money elsewhere .
And Toshiba is totally unconcerned .
I took the computer into Best Buy where I purchased it and they kept it over night to study it .
Whenever tried to turn it on , it would restart as soon as the BIOS launched Windows ( or Winblows , as I like ot call it ) .
I ordered my 2012 mac mini after being disappointed with spec of the new 27 " Imacs .
No big deal .
They had me send in the machine last April returned it to me in May with no documentation on what was done it anything .
I have no idea how this could have even gotten past quality control during production .
The troubleshooting said it was the AC adaptor so we ordered a new one .
The OS is great .
with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch .
Do n't waste your money !
Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase .
i needed one to be able to carry to work everyday and this one seems to fit all of the criteria .
But the mountain lion is just too slow .
This is an over-sized , 18-inch laptop .
I purchased two laptops ( for my husband and 16 year old daughter ) .
I love this 13 " Mac white unibody .
I did n't like one thing about it .
still testing the battery life as i thought it would be better , but am very happy with the upgrade .
I plan on using my MacBook Pro for a long time .
They do n't crash .
In early May I got it back and this time I only had it back for 1 day before it had a NEW issue so it was sent back in for the 6th time they " expedited " the repairs so I was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed , by a " Senior Tech " .
I 've been having endless problems since I bought the computer - only 1 month ago
I initially purchased my Macbook Pro 13 " in April , and I loved it .
and it fits in my briefcase with ease
Great purchase and I definitely did n't miss out on the Black Friday deals .
Here are the things that made me confident with my purchase : Build Quality - Seriously , you ca n't beat a unibody construction .
If you are looking for something reliable , this is the laptop for you .
bought notebook 07/2009 .
Web access through the 3G network is so slow , it 's very frustrating and VERY DISAPPOINTING .
Looks nice , but has a horribly cheap feel .
I have had the netbook for 2 months and I love it , I read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other computers I use .
I was even able to uninstall McAffe and install one of my Symantec licenses with a no issues whatsoever .
More relieved than anything .
I would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express .
It is easy to use and lightweight .
The size is perfect and I do not recomend anything bigger except for any person who can exceed the limited space it gives you .
It was old but it was not till we bought the Dell did we realize how great it was .
It is super easy to use .
Easy to start up and does not overheat as much as other laptops .
pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were .
Only a few days after I received the computer back , the screen froze again .
I love the Mac so much better than my work PC !
Unfortunately , that is not the case .
The macbook pro is really responsive .
the mbp i recieved was everything it should have been .
After the bad experience with this computer went back to compaq .
My son said it popped up and he clicked update .
I previously purchased a 13 " macbook ( had pro specs and was aluminum style ) which had a nvidia 9800 ( If I am not mistaken ) and it had major heating issues .
It is the best all around Mac .
After replacing the spinning hard disk with an ssd drive , my mac is just flying .
Where you click and hold and drag it picture , link , etc to where you want it .
Everything was so easy .
When i finally held it in my hands i kissed it , yes i did .
Yet , HP wo n't do anything about the problem .
This is my first personal Satellite purchase but had very good experience through previous Satellite work issued laptops .
Runs very smoothly .
Everything else just install and go .
I think it was seventy nine plus tax .
Thus , when you carry it at a slanted angle , the screen will " topple " or " slide " down , if you understand what I mean .
Despite the claims of the Apple apologists ( a vice of which I am recently myself reformed ) the internals of Mac laptops are NO different from PCs ' at this point .
Despite the inconvenient weight , I opted for the 12 cell battery .
With today 's company fighting over marketshare , its a shame that ASUS can get away with the inept staff answering thephone .
I called Toshiba where I gave them the serial number and they informed me that they were having issues with the mother boards .
YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET FOR .
We carry the netbook around here and there , hence it 's kinda of irritating when the LCD just " slide " downwards .
The cons are more annoyances that can be lived with .
Again - windows based machines were not giving me anything to work with !
If you could stretch by a few 100 dollars I highly recommend you should replace your Windows laptop with this one .
They really screwed the pooch on this one .
Price and purpose is awesome !
This is the first time that I tried and owning a netbook although I have used 3 different laptops in the past 10 years , I find not much difference except of course for the screen size .
I came from the Dell Laptops and now I am so glad I switched when I needed a new laptop .
My friends are in awe every time they come over !
Overall the computer is very easy to use , the screen is perfect , great computer , my daughter loves .
My friends or children use that when they need to borrow the Net =) When I out grow this Meaning when its old and my oldest child is ready for one she will get this one ANd I will be buying only TOSHIBA !
I shopped around before buying .
In the shop , these MacBooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure - so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it , get it home , break the seal and use it ( very clever con ) .
Every single one we 've gotten we 've had problems with .
But see the macbook pro is different because it may have a huge price tag but it comes with the full software that you would actually need and most of it has free future updates .
/ awesome cooling system / much better grafics card ( ATI 5870 ) / 8GB RAM / LED backlit screen ...
I love the keyboard .
Actually , I had noticed the one on the sales floor also did n't have sound !
It 's so much easier to navigate through the operating system , to find files , and it runs a lot faster !
He did n't work for sony , he was just approved to fix their crappy products .
Acer was no help and Garmin could not determine the problem ( after spending about 2 hours with me ) , so I returned it and purchased a Toshiba R700 that seems even nicer and I was able to load all of my software with no problem .
In November my computer messed up entirely and would n't power on after intalling a Windows update , I had to have my HD flashed and lost EVERYTHING on it , including my school assignments and irriplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things , when this update was installed for some reason I was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installed it deleted my history .
I fell in love with my machine , and it was pampered .
I consider myself an average user and this computer serves my need .
It is really thick around the battery .
I had read online that some users were having sound problems .
When it come time for warranty service to Toshiba you do n't matter .
Now , I guess , I 'll have to unload my M6809 on some poor , hapless soul .
Now when I order I did not go full scale for the webcam or full keyboard I wanted something for basics of being easy to carry when I use crutchs or wheelchair and with a backpack laptop bag .
The 13 " Macbook Pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to CA this is the best price we can get for a great product .
It is her first laptop and she is thrilled .
First off , I really do like my MBP ... once used to the OS it is pretty easy to get around , and the overall build is great ... eg the keyboard is one of the best to type on .
It was a bad experience but i played down its importance .
I ca n't imagine EVER buying a PC again !
With a healthy pessimism , I took the machine home and tried to find a flaw .
So i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer
It was a huge monstrosity of a Laptop !
I ca n't even remember how I finally got it taken care of , but I was done with Sony after that !
Set up was easy .
both upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary Product Key .
I saw the bad reviews from people saying to buy directly from Apple and I was concerned but I took my chances and am overly impressed .
I love the glass touchpad .
The keyboard is top notch .
I only wish this mac had a CD/DVD player built in .
No luck , although I waited for hours on the phone-Visited MacHouse , they stated the their call center is down due to too many phonecalls ( difficult to believe ) .
So much faster and sleeker looking .
The apple care has never failed me , and I expect it to be the same for this computer as well .
My laptop with Windows 7 crashed and I did not want Windows 8 .
I like the lighted screen at night .
The new MacBook is lightyears ahead of my old white plastic MacBook circa 2006 .
I love this laptop , and use it everyday to do something , and never lets me down .
I upgraded the memory and replaced the base Windows 7 Starter to Win 7 Home , and it runs just fine .
* 2 weeks after giving the computer for repair * - Called headquarters , they report that they have not looked at it yet but it is " on the top of the stack " .
I love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention PC 's require .
I pondered very long over this decision .
It 's fast at loading the internet .
In desparation , I called their Customer Service number and was told that my warranty had expired ( 2 days old ) and that the priviledge of talking to a technician would cost me ( " have your credit card ready " ) .
Mac is not made for gaming .
That 's quite a bump up from the $ 599 that this little guy sells for , which leaves me to my next point .
Lightweight and the screen is beautiful !
Enjoy your sitdown
Laptop is advertised as a 15 " but the casing looks like that of a 17 " .
The computer was shipped to their repair depot on june 24 and returned on July 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned .
This computer had exactly the specifications I needed .
I took 3-4 years researching brands and prices of laptops .
All the problems I have had with PC 's are solved with a Mac : the issue of overheating-my Dell was always overheating and not working properly or simply shutting off , and the issue of viruses and contaminants-my HP completely quit working within2 years of purchasing it , with no inexpensive way of fixing it .
All apple associates are always wiling to help you out with anything , no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed .
I have loved this since i took it out of the box .
- They reported that the computer is in their headquarters .
So , I 'm cooled on Mac buys .
The Mac Book Pro performs flawlessly .
but in resume this computer rocks !
also you may need to charge it once a day , if for medium use every thing fast and easy with mac the size and look is the most feature that attracted me to it .
Also , if you need to talk to a representive at Microsoft , there is a charge , which I believe is robbery , since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system , which most people would have went with XP if they could .
Images can be multi-selected and viewed swiftly or in slideshow mode .
He came into my house , fiddled around on the computer for a good forty minutes and got ready to leave before it was even done doing what he was doing to it .
fast , great screen , beautiful apps for a laptop ; priced at 1100 on the apple website ; amazon had it for 1098 + tax - plus i had a 10 % off coupon from amazon-cost me 998 plus tax - 1070 - OTD !
I took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it .
In addition , there is photo detection software that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the picture .
The only issue came when I tried scanning to the mac .
I love the solid machined aluminum frame , and the keyboard is the best of any laptop I 've used .
I was n't really sure I wanted to spend that kind of money !
I grew up in a design family so it only made sense .
I needed a laptop with big storage , a nice screen and fast so I can photoshop without any problem .
It 's a great prodcut to handle basic computing needs .
I am using the external speaker - sound is good .
This laptop has only 2 USB ports , and they are both on the same side .
It has been nothing but trouble from the time we bought it .
I took it to the shop and they said It would cost too much to repair it .
This newer netbook has no hard drive or network lights .
So I got another netbook which I love !
GREAT INVESTMENT !
TOSHIBA WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THIS PROBLEM .
I love the feel of the key board , as well as the trackpad .
I believe this is because I was more active than the average user , meaning I average about three " tabs " .
I have had some excellent computer and have found I had no idea what to do with them
I spent 2200 dollars on a " top of the line laptop " .
the latest version does not have a disc drive .
We researched and found the best price at MacConnection .
The i5 blows my desktop out of the water when it comes to rendering videos .
The battery lasts as advertised ( give or take 15-20 minutes ) , and the entire user experience is very elegant .
Easy to carry , can be taken anywhere , can be hooked up to printers , headsets .
HP said I had done the damage .
Logic board utterly fried , cried , and laid down and died .
Easy to install also small to leave anywhere at your bedroom also very easy to configure for ADSl cable or wifi .
I 'm done with WinDoze computers .
But Sony said we could send it back and be charged for adding the bluetooth an additional seventy something dollars .
NO good .
Acer wo n't replace the laptop .
In the short time of one month since the 2012 Mac Mini was released there are well over 1000 posts regarding this issue and the numbers keep rising .
( The iBook backup also uses a firewire connection ) .
My mac laptop is fabulous in both areas .
But the machine is awesome and iLife is great and I love Snow Leopard X.
It 's software and speed enable it to do amazing things .
I saw this one , and I have the most difficult time trying to use them , they 've made great dust collectors , I hate putting this computer down
I ca n't believe how quiet the hard drive is and how quick this thing boots up .
In the first moth of owning this computer its hardrive failed which had to be replaced .
It was hard to handle and operate at school .
The keyboard is like no other laptop keyboard .
Registration/1st use is easy .
It does n't have a lot of frills , but I did n't need any , and being able to buy what I needed , and not more than I needed was very important .
It has a 10 hour battery life when you 're doing web browsing and word editing , making it perfect for the classroom or office , and in terms of gaming and movie playing it 'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours .
Info : Windows failed to load because the kernal is missing , or corrupt .
I would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an easy to use , stylish , fun , awesome computer .
Overall it 's an amazing product , 5 stars !
I seem to be having repeat problems as the Mother Board in this one is diagnosed as faulty , related to the graphics card .
Will certainly use MacConnection again .
I ordered through MacMall , which saved me the sales tax I would have incurred buying locally .
This is a review of windows vista system .
They don t translate from a Mac , even on Word , resulting in a ton of run-on sentences .
i had to return it for a replacement .
But guess what ? ( you have to buy an external dvd drive it does n't have a built in type ) The notebook ca n't be used because it does n't read anything for an external drive .
Not a bad laptop , it 's a bit slow , but gets the job done .
I used windows XP , windows Vista , and Windows 7 extensively .
Having heard from friends and family about how reliable a Mac product is , I never expected to have an application crash within the first month , but I did .
There is hardly any memory on the computer 's hard drive .
- Computer crashed frequently and battery life decreased very quickly .
Then the hard drive failed ;
power supply went bad after 2 weeks --
There were small problems with Mac office .
I fell in love with it .
Many people complain about the new OS , and it 's urgent for Apple to fix it asap !
I am able to organize my pics , music and files easily .
I 've already upgraded o Mavericks and I am impressed with everything about this computer .
One drawback I noticed was sound quality via USB .
I think this will happen to any new version of computer/phone released and I need to wait for the next set of updates to have all of this fixed .
The computer could have been shipped by Priority Mail through the USPS for the same cost and arrived by Noon on Tue .
*** The review below is no longer relevant , Apple has fixed the issue .
It came in brand new and works perfectly .
this computer will last you at least 7 years , thats an amazing life spanned an electronic .
All the programs are easy and straight forward on my MacBook Pro , it is clean and organized , which I always strive to be myself .
I do n't have that additional money right now , and therefore would n't have purchased it at this time .
It is the easiest computer I have ever used
Look up recipes and keep it on the kitchen counter while I cook .
I especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems !
Honestly , I am surprised no one else has mentioned returning theirs .
After paying over $ 1000 for this computer , it was not worth it .
This computer was awful !
I would like to tell you about the best laptop I just got from Mac .
My last laptop gave me a constant battle even though it was also completely new .
Who could n't love a DVD burner , 80-gigabyte HD , and fairly new graphics chip ? As I soon discovered , though , there is a reason for which similarly-configured Sony and Toshiba machines cost more : they use higher-quality components that are faster , better-configured , and end up lasting a lot longer .
I bought it for college and so far it 's amazing !
Even set at the highest level , the computer sacrifices its queen every time .
It is just slow slow slow .
We were PC users .
My only gripe would be the need to add more RAM .
Only issue is that it is a little slow , and I 'm fixing that by adding more RAM .
Other than not being a fan of click pads ( industry standard these days ) and the lousy internal speakers , it 's hard for me to find things about this notebook I do n't like , especially considering the $ 350 price tag .
Even doing so , the hinge may just be slightly tightened only .
My power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership , so it was covered by the Applecare warranty plan .
This laptop does everything I need it to very well .
I always swore by PCs and would never consider a MAC .
i would really recommend to any person out there to get this laptop cause its really worth it .
If this would be your first Mac purchase then I would highly suggest that you take advantage of the class that they offer to learn about the differences between Mac and PC 's .
It was truly a great computer costing less than one thousand bucks before tax .
I have had it over a year now with out a Glitch of any kind . . I love the lit up keys and screen display ... this thing is Fast and clear as can be .
:] It arrived so fast and customer service was great .
I 'm having the laptop returned unrepaired since paying $ 176 every 3 months just is n't worth it ( that 's about how long the port seems to last ) .
I am going to college next year and I needed a cheaper , quality computer for the goals I am trying to pursue .
But if you are in the computer field you probably would n't be here .
I love its solid build , light wt and excellent battery life ( for now ) .
They were great in handling this problem , and I 'm looking forward in purchasing additonal products from them in the future .
My friend just had to replace his entire motherboard , so did my wife , and it looks like I will have to as well .
It discharges too quickly .
GET THIS MACHINE
Peformance is good for the price .
It crashes , and when it goes flat , it just DIES ( like a PC , maybe worse ) and I loose all my open documents !
The battery was completely dead , in fact it had grown about a quarter inch thick lump on the underside .
- Apparently , contactus@euro.apple.com is not a good address to send complaints .
It is very slim , the track pad is very much impressed with me .
When I called Sony the Customer Service was Great .
Everything is so easy to use , Mac software is just so much simpler than Microsoft software .
they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem .
I took the computer back in yet again except this time they kept it to send into their Geek Squad headquarters .
Overall I feel this netbook was poor quality , had poor performance , although it did have great battery life when it did work .
We also use Paralles so we can run virtual machines of Windows XP Professional , Windows 7 Home Premium , Windows Server Enterprise 2003 , and Windows Server 2008 Enterprise .
After paying several hundred dollars for this service , it is frustrating that you can not get help after hours .
I got the black MacBook two years ago and have never regretted it .
I hope this review helps .
Product support very poor as each phone call costs me long distan
The feature are good enough for what I need .
I ca n't even install one of the 3 printers I have in my house so I am unable to print .
If that is the case , then I am completely happy
The brand of iTunes has just become ingrained in our lexicon now , but keep in mind that Apple started it all .
I have had the luxury ( sarcasm ) of owning 2 of these laptops .
Numerous problems over the next 3 weeks until I got the blue screen of death and had to send the PC back to HP .
I enjoy very much my new Toshiba , purchased specifially for attending online schooling .
Not even safe mode boots .
It will make life so much easier next semester , just wish I had it last semester !!
All I will say now is that it was over two grand less expensive and so much better quality than my hunk of crap Vaio .
Oh yeah , do n't forget the expensive shipping to and from HP .
its by far faster and more stable then my PC .
I have nothing to regret from this new product .
The acer one compuer is a great computer .
I was constantly having to roll back the computer after doing updates .
I really like the size and I 'm a fan of the ACERS .
but other then that I would give this product a 4 in hafe stars .
She said Wal Mart rants and raves abouy carring Dell because it 's a big name but they are a piece of garbage .
And it is impossible to get them back in .
The resolution is even higher then any other laptop on the market .
I bought a protector for my key pad and it works great : )
The battery holds up well , it 's built very solidly , and runs fast .
Handles all my basic media needs easily .
That 's very possible , but since they do n't make Windows XP drivers for the sound card in this machine , I was stuck until Windows 7 came out .
The smaller size was a bonus because of space restrictions .
The OS is easy , and offers all kinds of surprises .
1 ) Payed $ 2200 for a " premium " laptop
I ordered four D620 laptops .
I was a little weary at purchasing another 13 " macbook almost 2 years later but t looks like the newer macbooks have gotten its current line of graphics cards in order this time around .
I am sorry that I purchased this laptop .
Let me start off by saying that I was highly reluctant to spend so much money on a laptop .
Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac .
I had to return it because it would n't even start .
I really do n't like it , but I am stuck .
I hate to say this , but if I could take this back to the shop and get my money back , then I would .
12.44 seconds to boot .
I was happy with My purchase of a Toshiba Satellite L305D-S5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the Toshiba Warranty .
it might be something deep within Windows , for I was unable to create a disk image on my hard drive .
It works fine with our wireless and they 've had not problems .
My laptop now has no battery .
This netbook went bad on me after 3 days .
" Then I proceed to tell her that I checked out other retail stores that carry the netbook and it was n't LIKE THAT .
Never any doubt I would get a MacBook , just was n't sure which one .
i 'm returning mine
The difference is the Toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space .
It completely supports my home business and personal life .
I 'll stick to Tashiba .
My previous purchases were with Dell and HP .
If you really want a bang-up system and do n't need to run Windows applications , go with an Apple ;
Toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought Toshiba will do nothing about it .
I wiped nearly everything off of it , installed OpenOffice and Firefox , and I am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price .
Drivers updated ok but the BIOS update froze the system up and the computer shut down .
If you are looking for a netbook pc DO NOT BUY FROM ASUS !!!
I had this computer for one month and had to send it in for repair .
Overall for the money this is a good deal .
air has higher resolution but the fonts are small .
i use my mac all the time , i love the software , the way it takes a short time to load things , how easy it is to use and most of all how you do n't have to worry about viruses .
Another thing I might add is the battery life is excellent .
It gets stuck all of the time you use it , and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work .
It 's also very energy efficient , running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a 60 Watt lightbulb .
A tip for people looking into this computer : DO NOT BUY IT save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last .
After they found no other way , they told me to courier it to them ( since they do n't allow the use of the post office ) at my expense , and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it would n't be covered .
u can do what u want in just few seconds , even to start up your computer takes few seconds .
The product is prefect for everyone .
I never had this kind of quality issue with Dell ( not to say Dell is that great ) , not with a brand new laptop .
The delivery was fast , and I would not hesitate to purchase this laptop again .
The machine is used , but is like new , i 'm very impress .
It made the computer much easier to use and navigate .
It 's silent and has a very small footprint on my desk .
It is a cheap throw together .
I would have given it 5 starts was it not for the fact that it had Windows 8
I hate the display screen and I have done everything I could do the change it .
Runs good and does the job , ca n't complain about that !
* 5 weeks after giving the computer for repair * - Apple offers to send replacement after they receive the old computer .
Do not purchase this laptop .
I am very satisfied with the mini .
I know Apples are more expensive than PCs , but he thinks it is worth every penny .
Dell Latitude d620 is not a reliable machine .
It is so simple to use , I use it more than my desktop .
The bottom-line is that this laptop just is n't worth it .
Now the machine wo n't connect and Toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in May but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now I 'm out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since I bought the netbook .
They freeze all the time .
The computer runs extremely slowly , whether opening Word or My Computer .
Love it so far .
I do admit it is pricey but the saying is really true with this MacBook Pro Laptop ( You get what you pay for ) .
This laptop rocks ( only wish it could run SolidWorks CAD - which Apple does n't support ) !
I have owned macbook pros since 2005 and this is the best yet !
IT WANT TAKE IT , IT KEEP SAYING ERROR .
Save your money and go for a better device .
I want the portability of a tablet , without the limitations of a tablet and that 's where this laptop comes into play .
I was really happy because it is a much better price on amazon.com than it was in the Mac store .
The resolution on the screen is almost pure HD .
The touchpad is extremely sensitive , which is the only drawback .
I ca n't even turn it off .
I love windows 7 but i ca n't give Toshiba any credit for that , unless y' all get serious about ergonomics and making required connections less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time .
Consumer Report recommended Toshiba .
In fact I still use manyLegacy programs ( Appleworks , FileMaker Pro , Quicken , Photoshop etc ) !
Yes , I have it on the highest available setting .
You just get a trial version either way .
Everything was up and running within 15 minutes of unboxing .
Built-in apps are purely amazing .
It all just makes sense .
I 'm using this computer for word processing , web browsing , some gaming , and I 'm learning programming .
I went from BestBuy to Dell , Windows to Apple .
Screen size is perfect for portable use in any environment .
As a user of a PC , I will will admit that the macBook Pro has a better running system in which I found myself " Getting the job done quicker .
at first !
Strong build though which really adds to its durability .
I bought it during the recent Comex IT show .
: - ) If you buy this - do n't go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life , and you 'll be perfectly satisfied .
Very fast boot up and shut down .
In short I would never buy a Compaq again .
Programs would crash all the time , and it turned out to be a very unstable , unreliable laptop for me .
I believe with Apple - you get what you pay for .
Well , maybe more like week one .
I have never had any issues or problems with my MacBook Pro so far , and it is still as fast as it was when I first bought it .
I made the right decision .
It 's so bad that I 'm thinking I only got half a battery or something .
and it has blue screen crashed on me twice .
It 's perfect for everything and runs faster than an average pc !
working with Mac is so much easier , so many cool features .
This is definitely a computer worth the money ;
I went right out and purchased another laptop .
It had some kind of pre installed software update that completely shut the computer down when you clicked it .
That 's right , no power , absolutely NOTHING .
falls into the case .
I have had it 9 months and it is already a $ 250 loss .
The price and features more than met my needs .
The machine is speedy and efficient .
I opted for the SquareTrade 3-Year Computer Accidental Protection Warranty ( $ 1500-2000 ) which also support " accidents " like drops and spills that are NOT covered by AppleCare .
I have been PC for years but this computer is intuitive and its built in features are a great help
The rep did not even answer my question , I had to ask him , if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he did n't even try to acknowledge my question .
Have purchased many products over the years from MacConnection and this transaction , like all the others , we smoothly with no problems .
First , you ll discover that the word processing program known as Appleworks rarely translates perfectly on anyone else s computer , if it translates at all .
So if you want a good machine that does almost anything this is the one , if you want a low budget computer then look at the other great brands Best Buy sells .
I work with kids and they love making short videos on there .
Other than that I do n't have one complaint in the world !
Many thanks , Overstock.com .
I upgraded it 's RAM to 2GB , I am very happy with it .
It doesnt get hot like my PC , with technology always at the tip of our fingertips anytime I forget how to do something i just google it .
I will have to purchase Spy ware or Nortell for privacy protection .
Also it is very good for college students who just need a reliable , easy to use computer .
I love it - never had a computer I was so impressed with - and I 've had a lot of laptops and desktops - this one is FAR AND ABOVE THE BEST ONE I EVER HAD BEFORE .
But in fact it is totally the opposite .
Still not bad for 220.00 .
Unfortunately , the laptop I purchased was also a Dell and again , I have to say i hated it .
iPhotos is an excellent program for storing and organizing photos .
It super shiny , so you can see the fingerprints easily .
Incredible graphics and brilliant colors .
And I 'm still paying the bloody financing , for a product which did n't last me at least three years !
not the day received .
- Bluetooth ( 2.1 ) , Fingerprint Reader , Full 1920x1080 screen - Integrated Mic/Webcam * - Dual touchpad mode is interesting , and easy to use -5 USB ports - Runs about 38-41C on idle , Up to 65 ( for me ) on load - Very quiet - I could go on and on .
I tried several monitors and several HDMI cables and this was the case each time .
From the build quality to the performance , everything about it has been sub-par from what I would have expected from Apple .
Just what the doctor ordered .
The screen almost looked like a barcode when it froze .
I have recently converted back to a mac and I could n't be happier !
Once you go Mac , you ca n't go back !
I am taking back today .
The screen is very large and crystal clear with amazing colors and resolution .
Nice screen , keyboard works great !
Hewlett Packard HP Pavillion DV6000 Laptop is the worst laptop we have ever bought .
Some features arent friendly ( volume wheel , sound quality , etc .
I can do everything I could before , only faster and more efficiently .
so when I had the money to buy one I bought other things instead .... a 700 laptop and some extra stuff with it .
I really like the Mac 15.4 in . Notebook , but its very pricey .
More likely it will require replacing the logic board once they admit they have a problem and come up with a solution .
They need to stop outsoucing and send some complaint calls to US based customer service agents for those who live in the United states .
I had to pay $ 100 for a universal charger for this cheap $ 300 laptop .
I love WIndows 7 which is a vast improvment over Vista .
Graphics are clean and sharp , internet interfaces are seamless .
HELP , HELP , OTHER THAN THAT GETS A GREAT LITTLE WONDER .
You better believe my next computer will be a MAC !
I actually had the hard drive replaced twice , the mother board once , the dvd drive twice , then they FINALLY agreed to replace it , ( ALL OF THIS IN LESS THAN 1 1/2 YEARS !
This causes my wrist to scrape up against it .
The port is secured to motherboard so when this happens you ca n't see the plug at all , it 's just gone .
i love to use it it is esay and light .
The mousepad is a huge pain in the arse !
I burned my leg , after lifting it from my desk , and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table , so I can place it there .
On two occasions the computer s calendar told me it was 1969 .
I decided to buy a few notebooks for my nephews for Xmas .
Let me start with the good : So awesome .
Apparently under the screen there are 2 little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth , they come loose .
I do not know for sure .
it was shooting sparks !
Perfect trifecta !
I visited the Apple Store and was impressed with the 17-inch MacBook Pro .
You can call HP and they want you to buy more software to fix it .
3 weeks went by and the computer keeps crashing and will not open any applications .
They replaced it and so far so good .
It 's a decent computer for the price and hopefully it will last a long time .
10 hours of battery life is really something else ....
The Dell Inspiron is fast and has a number pad on the keyboard , which I miss on my Apple laptops .
I should have spent an extra hundred bucks and got a full sized computer .
Without a doubt , the * design * of this laptop is fantastic .
It is very easy to navigate even for a novice .
Has a 5-6 hour battery life .
little short on RAM but you get what you pay for .
It has come into good use for my finances , scheduling , my parents business expenses , and it is definitely amazing for gaming .
After the warrenty expired the hard drive went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace .
I have three words : Piece of Junk !
But my blog is read by my friends and search engine visitors .
I love this little one .
I wanted to spend around $ 700 to $ 800 so I was directed to a nice looking HP Laptop .
The games included are very good games .
Honestly , this is absolutely wonderful .
Called Acer many times , they want me to pay the shipping to ship it to their repair center - I was very disappointed since it is a brand new computer !
And the ram ( the thing that makes it faster ) comes sporting 2 gigs for high performance to handle more stuff at once and surf the web a whole lot faster than before .
I droped this once from thetable when my baby girl grabed me one day and IT is still working with NO issues !
Best thing is I can use existing 32 bit old programs .
This was a great deal for a decked out MacBook Pro .
I HATE this one .
WiFi capability , disk drive and multiple USB ports to connect scale and printers was all that was required .
another problem .
Love it .
I had 3 months when the ports started going out .
thanks for great service and shipping !
I was ready to take it back for a refund , but the Geek Squad camed through and pointed me in the right direction to get it fixed .
My hp G60-244dx died after only 16 months .
It is easy to use , good quality and good price .
My review mainly talks about the difference I have felt between an early 2011 and late 2011 mac book pro .
It has easy to use features and all the speed and power I could ask for .
Well , I bought this laptop a month or two ago .
I made a photo book as a gift , on my computer , pushed " Buy " and it drew from my iTunes account and sent the book to my house , the book was of perfect quality-exactly how I had created it and looked better than I had even imagined .
:) Great product , great price , great delivery , and great service .
I stayed up half the night enjoying my new MacBook Pro .
I went with him and we picked this one .
I was a little concerned about the touch pad based on reviews , but I 've found it fine to work with .
People know what they are talking about and they have pride in the product that they are selling .
I got tired of buying laptops and having them stop working after a year .
And if you are switching from a pc I hilghy sugest this one .
I 've lived with the crashes and slow operation and restarts .
It has served my needs quite nicely for the most part .
It 's fun to take to a bookstore , sit in the coffee shop area , sign in to WiFi and look up book reviews of books I might buy .
The OS is also very user friendly , even for those that switch from a PC , with a little practice you can take full advantage of this OS !
They were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place .
I would say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful .
Accordingly , I have decided to NEVER purchase another HP product ( my five year old Compaq ) lasted 5-years before the hard drive crashed .
I 've had friends with Acers who seem to have had similar or exact same problems .
See when it comes to laptops you buy it and get just a normal operating system with trials of must need stuff that should come with it .
Summary : They played games with me for the warranty period .
It even has a great webcam , and Skype works very well .
We 'll save our money to replace it with a Mac again !
Finally , I could n't take it anymore and ordered my Apple .
Even though the computer is larger they did not make the keyboard larger .
Great Laptop for the price , works well with action pack games .
I also experience the same with my MacBook Air .
These new problems were the final straws ;
It allows me to do everything I need from a computer and more .
I should have checked this before I installed my applications .
It is pretty snappy and starts up in about 30 seconds which is good enough for me .
It had the full sized touch pad with 2 buttons instead of just one .
It suddenly can not work .
In fact , somehow ( and I never opened it up ) some specks of dust or something got inside the screen and are now there permanently , behind the front of the screen , in the way of the display .
2 months later , the battery went .
It is so speedy .
The Toshiba Satellite laptop is DESIGNED to fail !
I have now had it for 1.5 months and love it .
ANd I babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke .
Needs constant repair .
this apple navigates you thru the unexplored world of the internet .
When I took it back to Best Buy I asked them if they were seriously trying to drive me insane !
I reinstalled windows through the recovery discs and everything seemed good again .
Thanks , MacConnection , for making this a seamless purchase !
The tech store I purchased this from sent it back , , , , , eventually I got a new or repaired machine approximately 3 weeks later .
Screen - although some people might complain about low res which I think is ridiculous .
I am pleased with the fast log on , speedy WiFi connection and the long battery life ( > 6 hrs ) .
I was amazed at how fast the delivery was .
This was around three years , maybe four years ago .
If what you need is a machine to do some surfing , email checking , word processing , and watching a movie or two , this is the machine you want .
This is a great computer .
The Mac version of Microsoft Office is cheaper than buying the actual and works just as well .
But after using it a couple of weeks , the overall operation is poor .
Screen is a bit glossy , but that 's not too bad .
I feel that it was poorly put together , because once in a while different plastic pieces would come off of it .
Its seen in movies , sitcoms , prominent important people carry and use them and they are GREAT !
English must have been his third or fourth language .
The best thing to do is build your own computer , but if u ca n't company 's like dell who allow you to choose the components are better and for the same price you can get a computer who compares to one of apple $ 2000 systems and if you google " dell coupons " you can find codes that take a signifant amount off the price .
* 3 weeks after giving the computer for repair * - Visited MacHouse Amsterdam .
It does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it .
Never had a single problem , and do n't have to worry about viruses .
It was definelty a smart move .
I spent alot of money on this product and its been a nightmare .
An absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will .
A great computer for light home use and business use .
The lcd screen stopped working on mine after 10 months .
When I got this laptop in 2007 to help me with school , I had a hard time from beginning .
This MacBook is an outstanding product with great value .
The guy then said that if I insist on having the hinge tightened , they can do it for me but I have to accept the condition after the " repair " .
I ve had several calls lasting more than an hour with promises to call back , but the return calls never came .
It was getting old and I needed a new school computer .
And , if you are going to deal with HP be careful .
Obviously we both got new Macs .
The computer did what it was NOT supposed to do , and I did n't know what to do ....
I love everything about this computer .
i am a huge computer person i love anykind of computer that works well , but when i got this one i was so happy with the way it works and how it runs its amazing .
Would HIGHLY recommend this netbook though .
Apple is unmatched in product quality , aesthetics , craftmanship , and customer service .
my information was all lost ( my fault , I know , but I never thought I would need to back up my information on a brand new Mac , the paragon of all computers !
Within a few hours I was using the gestures unconsciously .
The sheer power and flexibility makes the MacBook Pro a must have for any techie !
MY TRACKPAD IS NOT WORKING .
The thunderbolt port is awesome !
! so nice . . stable . . fast . . now i got my SSD !
If you start on the far right side and scroll to your left the start menu will automatically come up .
Good price .
the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have .
they have not sent a new one nor called .
As an owner of a Toshiba Satalite laptop computer things you should know before you buy .
Sorry , newegg .
Out of all the laptops I have owned , this is by far the best !
I also got the added bonus of a 30 " HD Monitor , which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh !
I just took the broken cords into the Apple store and they gave me new ones .
Fan vents to the side , so no cooling pad needed , great feature !
You can do absolutely anything and is very fast and stylish .
The computer itself was fast , ran smoothly , and had no problems .
I babyed the heck out of it and i still do .
This was an update from an early MacBook Pro .
The ease of set up was terrific .
If you need an affordable , entry-level laptop , this will fit the bill .
This was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped .
I wish I would have taken the plunge years ago .
From the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer !
Since I have always used Apple products , the choice of Macbook Pro was obvious .
Those moments in thime where you want to throw something against the wall ? Yeah , I wanted to throw that lap top out the window and light it on fire .
Exactly as posted plus a great value .
Although I opted for the lowest end MacBook Pro , this thing holds its own .
Great , quick laptop for the money .
My husband uses it mostly for games , email and music .
defective software .
mac is extremely different than any other laptop .
After 2 months of complaints , Asus finally sent the right power supply to my techies .
It is so great , I can Hardly ever take my hands off it !
I 've saved a lot of time and headaches so far , using my new MacBook Pro .
Images are crisp and clean .
If anything , I would only suggest using one of these laptops if only you have to .
So far , so good .
This laptop leaves alot to be desired , I have had it only 5 months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice ...
- No backlit keyboard , but not an issue for me .
I have a business website and every time I have to change something I have to go to the public library to use a PC .
Which I still use and have hooked up to my TV .
From the get-go , the M6809 was unsteady in its operation ;
( but Office can be purchased ) IF I ever need a laptop again I am for sure purchasing another Toshiba !!
I agree with the previous comment that ASUS TECH SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE WHICH IS A CON IN MY OPINION .
I have an iPhone , and iPad , so it just made sense to finish off the platform by adding the Mini .
While I mostly use it for email , internet and gaming , I 'm confident all other applications live up to the high standard I 've come to appreciate from Mac laptops .
first i have been searching for long time before i decided to get mac .
Mom , Dad , Brother , sister , You name it !
Sadly Apple has discontinued this MacBook , I think it was never super popular since it fell somewhere in between the cheapest white model and the smaller Pros .
I bought my macbook a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since .
The shop will definitely push the problem to the service center .
I think this is about as good as it gets at anything close to this price point .
( No problem with the ordering or shipping by the way .
Was not happy with one of the programs on it .
They were able to set-up with labtops themselves within a few minutes .
the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer , left right and front .
Would do business again .
I ca n't honestly say I was heartbroken .
This laptop is fast and you will literally learn all you can do with this dynamo by just watching the online tutorials .
I would rather spend my money on a computer that costs more then a Toshiba that is n't good at all .
I was not aware that this product can not display websites that contain Flash .
Boot time is super fast , around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute .
This is my 3rd Apple Laptop and first MacBook Pro .
Windows is also rather unsteady on its feet and is susceptible to many bugs .
I would n't play a first-person shooter with this , mind , but if you wanted to run MS Office , email , chat , download a video , listen to music from a certain fruit-named music store , and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in , I 'd highly recommend checking this out .
The downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook : screen size is not something I 'd stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week .
Also , in using the built-in camera , my voice recording for my vlog sounds like the interplanetary transmissions in the " Star Wars " saga .
With what I paid for this computer it should have had everything on it .
I purchased this laptop while on a business trip to keep up with my email .
It was about six months later when the overheating problem started again , to the point it felt like fire on the bottom of the machine !
There 's literally no way to make it sing with Vista .
The battery life also does n't keep up with the claim but still I think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack .
It has surpassed all expectations and fulfilled all my needs .
Also , the battery does not last very long at all .
You know , using the computer should be fun , not aggrevation , especially when you are playing games or working with photos .
It 's a great product for a great price !
I have n't used the product long enough to write a detailed technical review .
There are reviews that speak to a few possible glitches but , I have n't seen them yet .
If I have a few hundred dollars to spare , I 'd buy the Pro line though , the 2.53 and 2.66 GHz model .
Obviously , this Macbook is P-E-R-F-E-C-T for me because it does exactly what I need in an easy-to-function way .
I will stack it up against laptops that cost twice as much any day .
One night I turned the freaking thing off after using it , the next day I turn it on , no GUI , screen all dark , power light steady , hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does .
But , for the cost this is a winner .
( I definatly ca n't ) .
Unable to boot up this brand new laptop .
So , if you 're thinking of a laptop , I would heartily recommend theApple 13.3 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer ( Z0J80001 ) Notebook for all your needs !
Thank you so much for the great item .
The Internet Explorer was very slow from the very beginning .
Did n't work when shipped from Walmart.com but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop ( same make/model ) .
This is my first Dell I heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it !
Yet my mac continues to function properly .
I am totally satisfied with my little toshie !
Works well , and I am extremely happy to be back to an apple OS .
Took that one home , same thing .
Still have n't solved this .
I have not have any problems .
Recommended to people as their first laptop .
I can throw anything at it ( and I do ) , Pictures , video editing , schoolwork .
I 'm really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer .
But , I would recommend this product .
But the performance of Mac Mini is a huge disappointment .
The investment of a new MacBook Pro came at a price , but totally worth it for a good piece of mind .
The 13 " MacBook Pro is portable , durable , and very capable .
I 'll wait and save up for a new one .
I am used to computers with windows so I am having a little difficulty finding my way around .
The OS is fast and fluid , everything is organized and it 's just beautiful .
It ca n't get any better .
I wish Toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the OS at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff .
I sent it to them to fix in perfect condition but for what was wrong with it .
It was not clear that the Microsoft Student Edition that was loaded on the computer , was a six month trial .
Everything is falling apart internally and externally .
Do your research on this issue .
I like the design and its features but there are somethings I think needs to be improved .
Ive owned Apple computers and laptops for as long as i could remember .
if yo like practicality this is the laptop for you .
It has just enough RAM to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs .
I do n't really have a complaint .
The SuperDrive is quiet .
It turned out it 's not really a problem to have a Mac .
What a mistake !
I had my IWORKS , Itunes , Email , MS Office , network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour .
The driver updates do n't fix the issue , very frustrating .
PC users work in Word , while Mac users work in Pages .
Keyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel .
Will probably never buy a HP again .
A MONTH LATER , we reinstall the OS ( Vista ) .
I now realize that my $ 900 would have been better spent on a Windows laptop .
I 've had it for about 2 months now and found no issues with software or updates .
It is more than enough computer to keep up with the needs of a high school student .
If only Bill Gates would read some of what is said here MS would do a better job .
You can imagine that an expensive item as a laptop will not be left on your front steps , it needs signature to pove that you received it .
THIS LAPTOP WAS BAD FROM THE FIRST DAY OF USE ---- BROUGHT IT BACK TO STORE FOR RETURN OF MONEY .
I claim that this has no value to me , the laptop was new anyway .
Everything is so easy and intuitive to setup or configure .
I might have read it incorrectly , but better safe than sorry right ?
the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happeneing so hopefully we can get a new one very soon !
If I have a problem with any of my apple items I make an appointment at one of my local stores and they work on correcting it right there .
I actually contact Toshiba before I started having problem and was given run around after I supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired .
The screen shows great colors .
It feels cheap , the keyboard is not very sensitive .
At least those computers did n't just die on me like this one .
Good monitor and performed well .
The much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare .
I ' v spent as much for shipping as I would to buy a new netbook -- of course a different brand .
I bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market .
With the softwares supporting the use of other OS makes it much better .
also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard .
It 's super fast and a great value for the price !
Enabling the battery timer is useless .
We upgraded the memory to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace increase in speed .
The sound is a bit quiet if you 're on a plane , this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones .
I acually believe the issue is with the Nvidia grafics card , but still requires a return .
You just can not beat the functionality of an Apple device .
The price was very good , and the product is top quality .
I would never tell anyone to buy one either .
Not to mention the fact that your mac comes fully loaded with all necessary basic programs .
Having a Mac certainly makes life easier .
I was loving this Netbook because it had an amazing screen and display and was small and light , but after 1 week it stopped openning web pages for me ( even after installing new browsers ) then eventually it just started giving me a blue screen and crashing everytime I booted it .
Very fast and efficient !
I was very excited because this was my first personal computer and I was purchasing it with my OWN money I had recieved from graduation presents .
He gave me this PC about 3 years ago and up to this point im still sitting here using it .
Though please note that sometimes it crashes , and the sound quality isnt superb .
The RAM memory is good but should have splurged for 8Mb instead of 4Mb .
The internet speed is spectacular .
The Hewitt Packard Pavillion dv6700 was my first laptop , before this I had a Dell desktop that I loved .
This process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the hard drive replaced 3 times .
they will not let you down .
The screen is n't huge , but that does n't matter when I output media to the 50 inch LCD TV .
? I am only interested in the 15.4 McBook Pro Model # MD103LL/A
I was psyched .
All was well .
Unfortunately , it runs XP and Microsoft is dropping support next April .
And i would recommend this to anypne looking for a new laptop .
What I 'd like is for the laptop to run well without having to purchase additional memory .
I love to write and play with graphics and html programming and my new Toshiba works great on both !
It is BLAZING fast !
I think this ps was manufactured in the mid 90 's .
The only thing I can imagine is that Sony jumped on early specifications for Vista requirements from Microsoft and designed it to those inadequate requirements .
I do n't know why I did n't make the switch sooner ... o ya because it 's expensive .
When you look at the specs on Apple products in comparison to a Dell or a HP , yes they do seem to offer less for a higher cost .
In the three years I 've had my MacBook Pro , I have never had a virus on my computer , and I do a lot of work on the internet .
No complaints for an Apple product .
See retired recently and decided that she wanted a laptop .
Pairing it with an iPhone is a pure pleasure - talk about painless syncing - used to take me forever - now it 's a snap .
Long story , but after many calls to various offices , I was told that no one can override the depot and that managers do n't take phone calls or e/mails .
I did add a SSD drive and memory
First it burned or fused the power adapter plug .
There has been no problem with anything .
I would definitely suggest this laptop !
after trying to get some help he disconnected on me .
Being a PC user my whole life ....
I 've almost have bought every generation of MacMinis since 2005 , and this one has n't let me down .
Thinking about returning it
Its fast , has High definition quality in the videos .
I do everything on this computer - check email , facebook , shop , check blogs , write papers , listen to music , and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv .
It has far exceeded my expectations for power , storage , and abilitiy .
They also use two totally different operating systems .
The system it comes with does not work properly , so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all .
Now I know !
and looks very sexyy :D really the mac book pro is the best laptop specially for students in college if you are not caring about price .
I like this machine because its very lightweight ...
OSX Lion is a great performer . . extremely fast and reliable .
I took it home and within 30 min , it was freezing up and did the " blue screen of death " .
( The SATA controller is the motherboard chip that lets the CPU talk to the hard drive . )
Quick and has built in virus control .
The screen takes some getting use to , because it is smaller than the laptop .
It does not even have the software to play a dvd now .
It was important that it was powerful enough to do all of the tasks he needed on the internet , word processing , graphic design and gaming .
Do you ever think HP would do that ? NEVER !
It is easy to use , has great screen quality , and every so light weight .
Sony parts reliability and quality of service is recenlty the worst .
This is the third in a series of MacBooks starting with a Black MacBook .
The wheel that turns the volume up and down does n't work in real time .
Very happy .
Of course , eMachines can not be made entirely to blame for this computer 's woes ;
I do transcription work on the side , and the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well .
Finally , the biggest problem has been tech support .
Most of them were either too big , too noisy and too slow after 2 years .
ive never had a problem with it !
To this day , there are NONE .
( Beware , their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a computer is .
Harddrive was in poor condition , had to replace it .
I would recommend not buying this product .
Another two weeks later and it was back in my possession .
It 's even easy to hook up to other wireless networks .
It had a seventeen inch screen which I wanted , but I did n't realize at the time it would be such a monster !
I am glad I did my research .
after much effort and 10 days ASUS replaced itThe WiFi is very weak .
But reasons we chose this Apple computer .
After purchasing this thing , I find out that I need a special interface device to connect my camera , and that it can not be purchased at the store - only on line .
This was absolutely annoying !
I 'm just really happy that I waited to buy , because this thing kicks a $ $ !
The 13 " Macbook Pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to CA this is the best price we can get for a great product .
With awesome graphics and assuring security , it 's perfect !
It 's ok but does n't have a disk drive which I did n't know until after I bought it .
My one complaint is that there was no internal CD drive .
I 'm all for saving money but Dell needs to step it up .
Even so , I like playing online games , so it was wonderful that there is a feature where I can dualboot Windows .
While we struggle with all the crashes and viruses , the kids computers stay consistent and so we caved in and bought one for buisness !
this Mac Mini does not have a built-in mic , and it would seem that its Mac OS 10.9 does not handle external microphones properly .
Theres always something wrong with it , wether it be some virus you ca n't track down , or it overheats , sometimes even catches on fire , you just ca n't use it .
I like iTunes , the apparent security , the Mini form factor , all the nice graphics stuff .
also it comes with very useful applications like iphoto that it is the best photo application i have ever had
Now , as easy as it is to use , and I do think it is a great STARTER laptop .
By the way teachers , they offer a discount which helps !
The Macbook starts fast , does n't crash , has a fantastic display , is small and light ( I have the 13.3 " model ) , and is n't always complaining about updates , lost connections , errors , blue screens , etc .
They say that this will invalidate the warranty on the hard drive ( I do n't really understand why but anyway ) .
it 's just a great toy to have around .
I 'm glad it waited , this one is great .
Was very much worth the price i paid .
Trying to balance all of my roles leaves very little time for me to do anything , so I want to manage my time I do have to be the most efficient .
Just bit the bullet and bought the Mac hoping it will last a lot longer … .
I complain again ...
If it 's not shipped on the next business day , called on a Friday they are closed on weekends , what was the next step .
ca n't reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary hardware drivers .
The body is a bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up .
I tell everyone that I know , friends , family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used .
I wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month .
And in 6 months , there have been no freezing up and no blue , purple , black or any other type of screen .
I sent it back to Toshiba twice they covered it under the warranty .
Plus two finger clicking as a replacement for the right click button is surprisingly intuitive .
The performance is awesome .
Wonderful sleek case design is only on the outside .
It is EXTREMELY fast and never lags .
