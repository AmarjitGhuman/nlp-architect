Cute and decorative .
And you never get the feeling that you need to leave .
This tiny Williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising .
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian .
The server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile .
You can even get packages of the chutneys to stock your fridge !
They do n't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai .
And I 've been to many NYC delis .
I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently .
Made my dining experience uncomfortable .
Also , specify if you like your food spicy - its rather bland if you do n't .
It was divine melts in your mouth .
I went to Common Stock for brunch and I was so impressed .
The best pad thai i 've ever had .
The hostess was very pleasant .
If you want Americanized Chinese food with your usual watery , generic white sauce , this is your place .
I live in the West Village and I 've been to a lot of restaurants .
But when you are seated the waitresses are great , they explain everything on the menu , and the price of the food is really cheap for the service you get .
The service is always bad though , do n't expect much of anything from your server , and I would not recommend bringing a date here either .
THe perfect spot .
I never write on these sites but this restaurant is def worth commending !
Ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me .
IT is the best deal in town for a Monday night dinner at a fine restaurant .
Service was on par but not wonderful .
You 'll be ther for every anniversary , birthday , valentines day ...
I in all reality felt as if I had just gotten off Air France and was in the 8th District in Paris .
All we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner .
The fillings may be unconventional but the dosa batter is definitely authentic and the combinations very tasty .
I particularly love their yellowfun tuna and their mussel selection .
Had dinner here on a Friday and the food was great .
From the beginning , we were met by friendly staff memebers , and the convienent parking at Chelsea Piers made it easy for us to get to the boat .
They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends .
Just go and see for yourself .
Be sure not to get anything other than bagels ! . .
This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money .
Anyways , if you 're in the neighborhood to eat good food , I would n't waste my time trying to find something , rather go across the street to Tamari .
great wine list ( italian ) , good food , service was INITIALLY fine .
I would highly recommend .
The food is so cheap and the waiters are nice .
Good food .
The only thing that strikes you is the decor ? ( not very pleasant ) .
I came again weeks later with my boyfriend and again had a very nice experience .
i have eaten here a handful of times , for no reason besides sheer convenience .
I 've eaten at many different Indian restaurants .
My wife and I also enjoyed the spinach , the Shanghai low mein , and other attractions .
This place has great indian chinese food .
Service was prompt and courteous .
The worst though was the taste .
We thought this a prelude to what the evening will be like .
A + + The service was good to excellent along with the attitude .
Friendly and informative staff , very attentive and prompt raw bar service .
The place just is n't ready for prime time .
Whenever you need a Sushi fix , Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service .
This is literally a hot spot when it comes to the food .
Food is excellent and they also have empenadas and plaintains which are good for an afternoon snack .
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently .
This place is so much fun .
Great pizza and fantastic service .
I 'm saving up for my next visit .
It 's to die for !
This is n't your corner Chinese food takeout .
Service is great , takeout is good too .
They never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table .
This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent .
The lunch special is an asbolute steal .
For those of you who do n't know , Uni is Sea Urchin in Japanese , which happens to be my favorite . )
Ambiance is barely romantic but management tries .
Truly the mark of an attentive waiter .
The Dim Sum was so-so , but not spectacular .
They all know you .
We will come back !!!
It was divine melts in your mouth .
First off , the waitress was completely unattentive the 2 times we saw her ( odd in a restaurant with 6 tables ) and got our order wrong .
I love the fact that the pizza tastes so good and is so cheap .
I 've made the trip out here a few times with a friend who lives nearby ( I live on UWS ) .
It was pleasantly uncrowded , the service was delightful , the garden adorable , the food ( from appetizers to entrees ) was delectable .
LOL
And comparing it to the Chinatown restaurants is simply not fair .
Great spot , whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner .
The manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group .
The tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent .
All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better !
Not what I wanted to hear .
Young neighborhood trendies graze at the counter during the day , while chic , art-house drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night .
Pizza was a little soggy .
LOVE the atmosphere - felt like I was in Paris .
Whether it 's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar , you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite .
The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
Even if the food was n't this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax .
Okay , so I never write but there does n't seem to fair balance of positive to negative reviews concerning Green Bo and it 's time to speak up - I live in Chinatown .
The food is awesome - definitely try the striped bass .
The bill is approximately $ 25 for 2 at lunch without drinks .
My turkey burger was not cooked at all , my friends salmon was completely raw .
I ordered the vitello alla marsala and I was pretty impressed .
The table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the service industry , I understood they were busy .
So all I 'm trying to say is this restaurant is by far the best thai food restaurant I 've ever been to .
As there were so many to choose from we wandered up and down the street looking in the windows and such noticicing many empty seats , except at Taj Mahal .
I LOVE their Thai
The sandwiches are dry , tasteless and way overpriced .
Suan has challenged this loyalty .
The food was authentic .
Result ( red velvet ) : Great texture , soft and velvety , nice hint of cocoa .
This place has the best pizza .
I had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz . of Maine Lobster in it .
Mazing interior .
The service was mediocre , and the lack of air conditioning made for a less than comfortable meal .
Although the place could be a little more eye catching and roomier , at the same time , it does n't really matter .
Great atmoshere and worth every bit .
We were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd .
Good Experience
If you want some roast duck , pork or chicken on rice with ginger , try them out !
While certain staples are excellent ( the burger , some of the pastas ) , the food is not really the point .
Quick and friendly service .
I would definitely go back for a very special occasion , but not for regular fine dining .
Maybe I say so because it looked promising for people who like artery-clogging jewish deli food , but turns out to be poorly run and awful .
my picks : Guizhou chicken , fish with hot bean source , fish fillet in spicy source ( special menu ) .
You can do it here .
for about eleven bucks you get a gigantic burrito ( or tacos ) , margarita , and dessert .
This restaurant was way overhyped .
Then they somehow made a dry and burnt crust , around a raw and cold inside .
There was a small wait , but shorter than I expected .
I 'm partial to the Gnocchi .
Have frequented ' ino for several years and the food remains excellent .
Best Taiwanese food in NY !
The food was bland oily .
last Tuesday for a late lunch with a friend .
The cuisine from what I 've gathered is authentic Taiwanese , though its very different from what I 've been accustomed to in Taipei .
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian .
The food arrived in about 15 minutes .
Bring your appetites .
When I 'm feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office , I head for Cafe St. Bart 's .
The food is amazing ... especially if you get the Chef 's tasting menu and your favourite bottle ( or two ! ) of wine from an extensive selection of wines .
There are a few Italian employees who may not speak the best English but for me that adds to the experience .
The sushi has been from average to below average , the wait service has always been sub-par the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating ( if you sit in the area beyond the kitchen , the acousitcs are horrid , everything echoes is extremely loud ) .
I will recommend Scopa to all of my friends for a place to go for wonderful Italian food .
I was in love with Pongsri on 48th , but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced .
I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND .
Although the restaurant itself is nice , I prefer not to go for the food .
The atmosphere is relaxed and casual .
Rude service , medicore food ... there are tons of restaurants in NY ... stay away from this one
All the food was hot tasty .
DO N'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHERS ON THE BLOCK WERE LIKE BUT WE WERE PLEASED WITH OUR CHOICE .
I 've waited over one hour for food .
We paid a fixed pricce but got nothing !!
Every course was better than the next .
This place is always packed .
While the room is not particularly comfortable , once you 're seated you 'll forget about everything except what 's on your plate .
Other guests enjoyed pizza , santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips .
Not worth the prices .
They are the best bagels I 've had .
Even the pasta is delicious here ( a rarity in New York pizza restaurants ) .
Nothing against a good sales call , but the tactics at Amma are just too obvious .
As we waited I watched 3 seperate groups of diners discuss how dissapointed they also were .
Volare virgins or weekly regulars , everyone gets treated the same and you ca n't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly .
I grew up on these bagels .
When we sat , we got great and fast service .
Service was prompt , friendly and great .
I recommend their Pad See Ew , Pork Chops or Tofu plates .
We ordered lamb which was perfectly cooked and tasted awesome .
Pizzas were excellent in addition to appetizers and main courses .
Granted the space is smaller than most , it is the best service you will find in even the largest of restaurants .
Went on a 3 day oyster binge , with Fish bringing up the closing , and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended , because it was so great !
We have tried every Thai restaurant between Atlantic Avenue and 4th Streets , and Joya is the best .
Service - friendly and attentive .
I loved it and would go again .
The food is surprisingly good , and the decor is nice .
The restaurant is cute but not upscale .
If you live outside the neighborhood , do n't bother !
I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors .
We were very disappointed .
But the service is HORRID !
Food was average but tasty .
Tuk Tuk is my second favorite neighborhood Thai place ( the first being Joya ) .
My husband and I have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the sushi bar ( chef Yoshi ) and ordered everything ala carte .
sometimes i get good food and ok service .
GO HERE .
To begin , we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave , when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready .
The seating was if they were trying to get the maximum amount of people into the restaurant , so be nice to your neighbor when you dine here .
The wine list is also really nice .
I would n't mind going back some time , but not before trying others nearby .
A beef Consomme .
Maybe it was the great company ( I had friends visiting from Philly – yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but I just ca n’t say enough good things about this brasserie .
delicious bagels , especially when right out of the oven .
In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food , this is one of the best spots .
The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree .
The wait staff was loud and inconsiderate .
The wine the service was very good too .
I am not sure if I would call the food here Indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be French with an Indian or exotic touch .
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta ( raddichio was kind of bitter though ) .
We were n't even at our table for more than an hour total .
They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great .
The service is great ( maybe even borderline nagging but at least you get attention ) , the desserts are excellent and the coffee is so very good ...
I visit New Green Bo when I have money or when I am broke .
Being from the south , there are n't any good delis in my area and while watching Foods across America on PBS I found out about Katz 's Deli .
Maybe it was just an unintentional mistake but I 've experienced the same with other restaurants so I do n't appreciate such practice .
Guess the 555Soul ads did n't launch her big modeling career .
Three page wine menu , one page entree and horedevous .
Enjoy !
They outshine HH .
i went in one day asking for a table for a group and was greeted by a very rude hostess .
Tasty but expensive .
A real dissapointment .
Great bagels , spreads and a good place to hang out in .
And I hate to say this but I doubt I 'll ever go back .
All in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side , but fresh .
The fried dumplings are GREAT !
Every time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street .
Murray wo n't do it .
The wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for Chinatown ) alternative .
You can do it here .
I knew upon visiting NYC that I wanted to try an orginal deli .
The miso soup lacked flavor and the fish was unfortunately not as well prepared as in the past .
I love the drinks , esp lychee martini , and the food is also VERY good .
You ca n't go wrong with this place .
Offerings like hot cakes and the Egg McMuffin sandwich are available for breakfast .
A great choice at any cost and a great deal .
If you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave.
The anti-pasta was excellent , especially the calamari , as were the filling pasta mains .
Service is excellent , no wait , and you get a lot for the price .
Go to japanese sushi place or Spanish tapas place - this creation in Williamsburg is a misstake .
Went on a 3 day oyster binge , with Fish bringing up the closing , and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended , because it was so great !
THR AT MOSHPHERE IS COMPACT , MODERN , YET COZY .
It 's a nice place to relax and have conversation .
Definately check it out !!!
After reading the good reviews of this restaurant , I decided to give it a try with two friends .
No , really .
Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES , I get angry that I did n't just go to Zucchero Pomodori .
This is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood .
I have been to Mary 's many times and I like it .
Get your food to go , find a bench , and kick back with a plate of dumplings .
I went there with my friend last saturday .
We been there and we really enjoy the food , was areally great food , and the service was really good .
All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better !
Ive passed by the spot tons of times always wanting to go in .
Great service , great food .
Love Al Di La
The service was outstanding .
Deff recimmend Bukhara they also have opened two new locations guess ill try them out .
The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive .
My boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent .
We had the lobster sandwich and it was FANTASTIC .
I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE .
The food is above average for midtown and sligtly better than some of the other Heartland Breweries in the city .
The staff is n't the friendliest or most competent , and I am stickler for service , but everything else about this place makes up for it .
I was a little leary about Mary 's at first - it 's small , crowded and you usually have to wait on line - but I 'm glad I finally tried it .
I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend .
The filet mignon dish was superb !
I must give it Yon out of Yon stars !
I really recommend the very simple Unda ( Egg ) rolls .
Had a late night dinner on a Saturday night .
No thanks !!!
It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips .
Terrible , terrible management - deserves to be shut-down .
The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions .
This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird .
Was there Friday night .
The food was as creative as the decor and both worked .
The only thing the waiters do n't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave .
I was wrong .
Be sure to try the seasonal , and always delicious , specials .
I plan on eating here more often .
Not enough wines by the glass either .
We had a party in their private room and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning .
The place was nice and calm .
Okay-i do n't mind the oily part ( cause most are cooked that way ) but it was way too bland .
Hats off to the chef .
In fact , you ca n't miss it .
THE FOOD PORTIONS ARE REALLY LARGE .
The menu is nothing like the one on the website .
Try the Times Square cocktail -- ginger lemonade with vodka ( also available without vodka . )
My fav was the sassy lassi ...
( The sashimi is cut a little thinly .
Over time , the food quality has decreased substantially , it is a lot less crowded than it used to , and the service must definitely be part of the reason .
Hey , I think $ 2 + for a 5 block walk ai n't bad .
Walk-ins are risky too .
Perhaps it was an off night , but it was suprisingly average for a 9.3 rating .
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty . hmmm .
Over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals .
The second you walk through the heavy vault like door , with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime .
One special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up , but save room for dessert !
I wish I could like this place more , and I wish someone would retrain the staff .
Our server was very helpful and friendly .
Waiters are slow but sweet .
Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant .
From beginning appetizers , the scallops were incredible , to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sorbet , we were delighted by the taste sensations .
I ca n't believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food !
$ 20 for all you can eat sushi can not be beaten .
The food was not very tasty , the portioins were tiny even for such a high quality restaurant .
My friend 's food was also the complete opposite of what it 's supposed to taste like ( aND look like ) .
Great food , good size menu , great service and an unpretensious setting .
It is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late , raucus dinner .
Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth .
Raga 's is a romantic , cozy restaurant .
The menu has so many fish items and oysters .
They pray to their Food Gods to make them into a good pizza like VT 's .
As a student in NYU i need a place to eat after a hard day of work so usually i just go to any indian restraunt near by .
El Nidos one of the best restaurants in New York which I 've ever been to , has a great variety of tasty , mouth watering pizza 's .
Food was okay , nothing great .
the real kicker of the menu , however , is the beef cubes or the chicken with chili and lemon grass .
The food is great and the milkshakes are even better !
You will pay a lot for the decore , but the food is no better or worse than a lot of other Chinese and Asian fusion places in NY .
Overall a disappointing experience for that price category .
Great food , great waitstaff , great atmosphere , and best of all GREAT beer !
My boyfriend and I recently had an early dinner at Artisanal and was satisfied with our experience .
Too bad Latin Quarters closed .
Oh and it 's too tiny for families with strollers .
The bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the " free " appetizer of olives was disappointing .
It 's best to go on a cold night with a close friend or a good book .
I do n't think I would go again .
Probably would not go again ...
The food is fresh , delicious , and reasonably priced .
Sushi experience was unbelievable with my fiance .
We were worried we would have trouble getting in , but somehow managed to have a short wait .
The dim sum is delectable while the prices are quite easy on the wallet .
We waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right .
Also , the place is popular with families , so if you 're bothered by children running loose like wild animals , come later at night to avoid them .
Great food ( spinach and corn dumplings and massamman curry ) , very friendly and no nonsense service and a clean and funky bathroom .
I love the place .
20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our surroundings and each other .
If the weather is nice , try to snag an outside table .
This is such a lovely , peaceful place to eat outside .
After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner .
I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries .
It just was n't Thai .
i 've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine , if not good .
I go twice a month !
Great Atmosphere
Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there .
bottles of wine are cheap and good .
I heard the lobster roll was excellent .
Yes , the prices are high , but I felt it was worth it .
As BFC does n't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !
And the staff is also young , energeic and hot !!!!
The plain slice is great and if you get toppings , the whole slice is topped with them , not sparsely sprinkled on like some places .
I would definently recommend this restaurant .
I also ordered for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the order .
And at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the check was given to our table by knocking over a glass of water .
The entire dining experience was wonderful !
LOVE the atmosphere - felt like I was in Paris .
Service is fast and friendly .
Hey , I think $ 2 + for a 5 block walk ai n't bad .
The service is always great , and the owner walks around to make sure you enjoy .
The Waitstaff were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal .
if you 're looking for authentic hong kong-style food , look no further .
It is by far my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn .
I went here in the afternoon with a friend .
My boyfriend and I are avid restaurant goers , and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended Flatbush Farms .
The food here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it .
Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood .
Not the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant .
A beautiful atmosphere , perfect for drinks and/or appetizers .
You wo n't find that anywhere in Manhattan .
One would think we 'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead , we got a snobby waiter would n't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so .
There 's something smooth about sipping sake upper east side style .
I was back-to-back with the diner at the table behind me and wait staff had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again .
The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world .
Everything was going good until we got our meals .
Good , because hey , it 's more food , but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap .
I asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if I like Uni . (
Between my guest and I , we sampled at least 80 % of the menu , and they were all hits .
The menu changed , portions were even smaller than before , a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility , a basmati rice dish lacked flavor .
Just because it 's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty , IT IS GREAT !
My husband and I both ordered the Steak , medium .
Now we moved out of the state and every visit to NYC includes a stop here .
The one vegetarian entree ( Abby 's treasure ) was actually quite a surprise - it was delicious and had wintermelon covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables .
we came here on a crowded saturday night and were seated right away despite being 15 minutes late for our reservation .
We refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore .
I went here with my boyfriend and another couple .
The service , wine selection , ambiance are all outstanding and deserve recognition .
We ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun ( dessert ) recommended by the waiter .
Spice is great Thai food , love the inexpensive appetizers .
We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the wait for a table .
It 's only $ 1.95 for a regular slice and $ 4.00 for a slice with a mushroom , not mushrooms .
We were charged full price .
Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at ALL COST !
The first time I went , and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere , I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad .
Definite go if you 're used to good Indian restaurant food from abroad .
Best things to order are from the grill ( Churrasco and Ribs ) .
Service was very prompt but slightly rushed .
When we walked in it seemed like it was there for 200 years .
If you love wine and cheese and delicious french fare , you 'll love Artisanal !
Give it a try and enjoy .
We will be back .
The closest that I got was the Cherry Marscapone , but they were out of it that day .
Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town !
Great Indian food and the service is incredible .
Casablanca servces delicious falafel , tabouleh , humus and other Mediterranean delights , which are all very inexpensive .
I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken .
Even upon delivery , their juicy pork buns are quite good . .
She replied " well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now , since you are a larger party , and it might get crowded . "
Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City
But for whatever reason , prices are about twice as high .
Stuffing yourself with Japanese food is a rare thing .
I 've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times , but more often I order delivery .
The comments about fried foods is correct ( below ) but the other dishes , including the lamb entree and many of the salads ( avocado shrimp ) were quite good .
IT IS DEFINITELY SPECIAL AND AFFORDABLE .
Would n't recomend it for dinner !
Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order .
When I arrived at Orsay I was thrown back , in a veyr good sense .
No , really .
The pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap , frozen , shredded cheese common to most pizzaria 's .
If you 're looking for a place to sit down , have a drink and conversations with friends , go to sweet-n-tart and order yourself a hong-kong styled milk and tea with tapioca pearls ( hot ) .
THE BANANA PUDDING THEY SERVE HAS NEVER SEEN AN OVEN , THE CRABCAKES ARE WAY OVER SALTED AND DO N'T GET ME STARTED ON THE VERY GREASY MAC AND CHEESE .
Just remember , the later you go , the longer you may have to wait .
The neighborhood was nice though so check out another restaurant instead .
i 've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine , if not good .
My husband and I had a blast .
Pacifico is a great place to casually hang out .
Have recommended the place to friends , always gets good response .
im not necessarily fanatical about this place , but it was a fun time for low pirces .
Stay far away from this place .
Everything looks great , the drinks , the decor , the food , even the people .
fine dining restaurant quality .
The freshest , best variety , and the fastest delivery .
The decor is what initially got me in the door .
I wo n't go back unless someone else is footing the bill .
You ca n't say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown .
The owners and employees are friendly and their pizza is fantastic .
It 's all about the food !!
We picked it randomly , without a recommendation from someone who has been there , so we were n't sure what to expect .
Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went .
The staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York .
I ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime .
When the bill came , nothing was comped , so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine , but I did n't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it .
They are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine , so if you want to make a reservation you are limited .
Don Pedro 's is one of my favorite restaurants .
I lived on 50th st , and wanted Indian one day so decided to check this place out .
The stuff tilapia was horrid ... tasted like cardboard .
With so many good restaurants on the UWS , I do n't need overpriced food , absurdly arrogant wait-staff who do n't recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy service , and management that does n't care .
for an appetizer , their calamari is a winner .
Priced at upper intermediate range .
Overall I would recommend it and go back again .
I recomend the chicken milanese .
This place has the best Indian food in New York , hands down .
Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available .
Also , the sandwiches ( nearing $ 7 ) did n't come with anything like chips or a side .
I would only go for the coffee which is way better than Starbucks or the like .
Really Lovely dining experience in the midst of buzzing midtown area .
Very popular style Izakaya ( Sake and small portion of sake-friendly dishes ) .
Always busy but fast moving .
i would go again if i did n't have to pay .
( that is A MUST , but not every restaurant can do ... )
Rao is a good restaurant , but it 's nothing special .
The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese ( gets a little messy ) .
I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart 's for their food , the ambience and wonderful service .
Big thumbs up !
In summer-eat outside on a terrace ( another great feature of Suan ) !!!
For asian fusion , there are many places further downtown .
My friends and I stop here for pizza before hitting the Kips Bay movie theater .
Service is fast and friendly .
I was n't impressed and it was n't SPICEY ????
I was in love with Pongsri on 48th , but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced .
What a great place .
As a retired hipster , I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city .
It was tiny and I felt like I was eating in someone 's living room .
You can get a completely delish martini in a glass ( that 's about 2 1/2 drinks ) for $ 8.50 ( I recommend the Vanilla Shanty , mmmm ! ) in a great homey setting with great music .
The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date .
The appetizers are just OK and the main courses were decidedly subpar .
Dug the blue bar area too .
The restaurant was quiet and intimate .
Why do people rave about the ambience .
Try it side by side and there 's no comparison .
Slightly above average wines start at $ 70 + with only one selection listed at $ 30 + .
I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she " had a BBQ to go to " that night - WTF ??
You order from a menu , so you leave feeling like you missed the full experience .
I recieved prompt service with a smile .
The staff members are extremely friendly and even replaced my drink once when I dropped it outside .
This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie ( that do n’t serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city !
The svc can be a bit rude at times , esp if you have big group , but overall the restaurant is a must !
The wine list is extensive , well priced and covers alot of regions .
The only concern i have is with the slighly all-business waitstaff who order and throw the food down , rushing you out .
INCREDIBLY POOR SERVICE AN FOOD QUALITY AT EXORBITANT PRICES .
Go inside and you wo n't want to leave .
i would recommend reservations on weekends though .
The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate .
Planet Thai is great !
The service was typical short-order , dinner type .
Jimmy is Dominican !
The wife had the risotto which was amazing .
Delivery guy sometimes get upset if you do n't tip more than 10 % .
The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I 've had at this price range .
The wine list was extensive - though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings .
The hot dogs are top notch , and they 're Slamwich is amazing !
Horrible experience - stay away !
It hits the spot every time
it 's delicious !
get over it !
Southern Indian cuisine is still there , too .
Indoor was very cozy and cute .
The bread is the soft paratha bread ( unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta ) , and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful .
I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork .
Went for a late weekday lunch .
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny .
Great pizza and fantastic service .
Lahore is a great place to duck into late-night when you need some really tasty food on the cheap -- you 'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for FOUR DOLLARS .
Owner is pleasant and entertaining .
Try the Pad Thai , or sample anything on the appetizer menu ... they 're all delicious .
I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i ca n't not mention or undermine .
I find that most Kosher restaurants are average to good , but this has been the best I 've eaten so far .
Overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites , but everything was delicious .
please do n't fool us .
I choose to go with one of the special , the braised lamb shank in red wine , which was excellent .
Seating is always prompt , though the restaurant does fill up in the evening .
We 've found it to be better and fresher than Kiku which is comparable in price .
I take all my NYC guests to VT 's .
Toons has recently been redone , so it 's now a very attractive space .
The staff is very attentive and we can almost always get a table .
When I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else .
I always find myself asking the waiter to make something bland and different than what is on the menu .
My gf 's duck confitte was very solid as well , although i have little base of reference .
The drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced .
The prices were fantastic .
Also get the Onion Rings -- best we 've ever had .
It 's true , you feel like your in a scene from Goodfellas .
First went here to enjoy their garden terrace .
Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months .
I will go back to Suan soon !
The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches .
Regardless of whether there are two people or two hundred people ahead of you the hostess will take your name and tell you Five minutes .
We loved it and will go back !
Had a great experience at Trio ... staff was pleasant ; food was tasty and large in portion size - I would highly recommend the portobello/gorgonzola/sausage appetizer and the lobster risotto .
Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm , but the open kitchen is part of the charm .
We were worried we would have trouble getting in , but somehow managed to have a short wait .
It took half an hour to get our check , which was perfect since we could sit , have drinks and talk !
The only thing more wonderful than the food ( which is exceptional ) is the service .
Most of the servers are very attentive , friendly and quite attractive .
An excellent service
Price is high but the food is good , so I would come back again .
The buffet had a nice selection .
They are amazing !
I wish they had one near my office - I would go everyday .
and for this i had to shell out a small fortune ?
Its a go-to for dates as well as entertaining out of town guests .
Sure enough , exactly 30 minutes later we got the call and were seated promptly .
Another plus is most of the entrees are approx .
Shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here : simple contract , deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20 .
Awsome Pizza especially the Margheritta slice .
Mussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening .
The chicken and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection , and the lamb sandwhich is great for heartier appetites .
( The asparagus , truffle oil , parmesan bruschetta is a winner ! )
Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .
No plans to return anytime soon .
At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at Bark you do n't just get your average hot dog .
i know , you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored , but my agenda is i 'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends , seeking a pleasant experience .
Would definitely visit again .
I will definetly be going back .
The dishes offered were unique , very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages , sardines with biscuits , large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream ( the best and freshest I 've ever had ) .
It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy , creamy , and slightly buttery .
The foie gras was sweet and luscious .
Excellent lunch buffet for only $ 6.95 .
I 'm happy to have Nosh in the neighborhood and the food is very comforting .
Trust me , it will be great , and all of it will be devoured in no time .
I have been to Casimir over 5 times and I have always had a great time there .
The owner and staff go to great lengths to make you feel comfortable .
My friends and I experienced amazing cheese and a delicious , new summer menu at Artisanal last night .
We got in line and were served while in line a bannan fritter .
Good food : my favorite is the seafood spaghetti .
great eats , good times .
Service was decent , but not as smooth as I would expect from a place with these prices and reputation .
and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs .
I have dined at Mammino several times now and each time it gets bettter .
Good to find a restaurant where the owners have some imagination and they have actually pulled it off , like in this case .
The appetizing is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable price ( if bought by the pound ) .
This place does n't compare with Mamoun 's in terms of price , freshness , value , and consisent quality , but that 's just my opinion .
Great Indian Food !
Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit .
Excellent sashimi , and the millennium roll is beyond delicious .
The staff is courteous and friendly .
Service was slow , but the people were friendly .
The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough ( both in quantity AND quality ) .
We , there were four of us , arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude .
Everyone was smiling so that made me feel welcome .
Ahhh ...
Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you 're with .
Tiny restaurant with very fast service .
My husband and I have been there at least 6 times and we 've always been given the highest service and often free desserts .
The service was attentive , yet unimposing , the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced .
All in all , this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city .
My party had the BBE $ 29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake !
I got the $ 10 10-piece dim sum combo , every bite of which was great .
And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ?
The food is so good and so popular that waiting can really be a nightmare .
Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that .
Sure , everyone 's got their favorite , but to know Sal , is to know New York .
Atmosphere is a bore .
I stumbled upon this great pizzeria as I explored my new neighborhood .
I had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz . of Maine Lobster in it .
Me and my girls will definitely go back .
Quite frankly , this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried .
If you like Sakagura but you feel it 's too much , you 'd better try Yokocho .
The pizza was really good .
The Yellowtail was particularly good as well .
Just bring someone who speaks Cantonese because waiter may not understand you .
We were 10 people celebrtating a birthday , we sat in the tent .
I go out to eat and like my courses , servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink .
I 've been to this monster sushi twice , the 46th st once , the 23rd st one a number of times .
Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn .
Every time I have a special occasion with my boyfriend I have a hard time going anywhere else .
My husband and I ate here after reading reviews here as well as hobokeni.com ,
The food is flavorful , plentiful and reasonably priced .
We also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka .
We ate out in the back patio , which is worth it as it 's cool and the music is hear well there .
No green beans , no egg , no anchovy dressing , no nicoise olives , no red onion .
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly .
The crab cakes are delicious and the BBQ rib was perfect .
Cute place , nice wait staff but would never go there again .
I have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .
This place is always very crowded and popular .
We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night .
The Yellowfin Tuna and Calf 's liver are my favorites !
The music was fascinating , but left room for conversation , and the bartender made superb drinks .
Starters : Kobe Beef Sashimi .
Do n't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes , they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections .
I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere !
the food is always fresh ...
The service was attentive , yet discreet .
We had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar food was just what we were looking for .
We have been to this place many times , and always have great food , wine , and service .
If you go for the pre-theatre menu , it 's an even greater deal .
It 's really also the service , is good and the waiters are friendly .
They are often crowded on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their service .
I went here with a friend on a whim , we went someplace else first and could n't get a table .
I like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing .
The food here was great , a treat from beginning to end .
I went with my fiance on a Tuesday evening .
Even though it is a little loud , you do n't have to yell at each other to talk .
Simple healthy unglamorous food cheap .
At night the atmoshere changes turning into this hidden jewel that is waiting to be discovered .
kalbi and nebbiolo do work together .
You can not go wrong at the Red Eye Grill .
however , it 's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .
The food was good overall .
My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time !
Please try the Filet Mignon , its just the most tender piece ever .
I have been there many times , and food is good and consistent .
We were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks .
Ambiance and music funky , which I enjoy .
Have always found that the waiters will go out of their way to be helpful , despite the fact they are often busy with lots of diners .
If I wanted to deal with a crappy scene and annoying customers I 'd go out in Manhattan .
We went to eat at the Jekyll and Hyde restaurant on Friday night and really enjoyed the fun atmosphere and good food .
Good atmosphere , combination of all the hottest music dress code is relatively strict except on Fridays .
The flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal .
highly recommended .
By far , the best pizza in Manhattan .
Please be aware that it 's CASH or AMEX only !
Overall , decent food at a good price , with friendly people .
I have been to Roth 's twice and both times were very disappointing .
The farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty .
While there are plenty of places to go for a good corned beef sandwich , Katz 's has a charm about it .
They came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant .
Small servings for main entree , i had salmon ( wasnt impressed ) girlfriend had chicken , it was good .
It first came well done , and I politely sent it back .
Love YUKA .
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included : ceviche mix ( special ) , crab dumplings , assorted sashimi , sushi and rolls , two types of sake , and the banana tempura .
I had a great experience .
This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant , the food .
We had the most wonderful waitress .
If you are in a big group , this place is perfect because it recomends sharing - they have lazy susans on most tables - even families can feel comfortable here .
I 'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food .
I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others .
Menus feature seasonal picks , like sweet corn-foie gras brulee .
Go spend your money somewhere that really wows you .
An awesome organic dog , and a conscious eco friendly establishment .
i 'm surprised about some of the bad reviews posted here - i 've been to tamarind about 5 or 6 times and always come away extremely satisfied and looking forward to returning .
Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service , which was boarderline rude .
The menu consisted of standard brassiere food , better then places like Balthazar etc .
The wine the service was very good too .
We asked to be moved ( which took half an hour ) , and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back , even though the rest of the room was practically empty .
How is this palce still open ?
While I quite liked the food and the ambience , I 'm not quite sure if it they really deserve it the Michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window .
Consequently , their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did ' nt feel like finishing them .
The food there are sastifying .
Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting .
My girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .
Service is average .
When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets , and then ordered for them .
uni from maine vs california , sea vs freshwater eel ) to get a good taste comparison .
The corned beef and pastrami are excellent , much less fatty than those big tourist places around Times Square .
I 've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious .
Delivery is fast too .
Le Pere Pinard has a $ 15 pre-theater menu that is outstanding .
I love and I know gourmet food by excellence !
ALWAYS full with tourists ( especially because of it 's close proximity to Rockefeller Center ) .
Overall , the best bagel in town .
The design and atmosphere is just as good .
I am surprised to say the least and find such practice not worth the effort .
The bar drinks were Eh , ok to say the least .
The restaraurant is very small so reservations are a must .
The menu consisted of standard brassiere food , better then places like Balthazar etc .
The pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC .
Simple comfort food and what hot and lage portions .
Great friendly service , Fast seating , Fast Delivery , Excellent sushi .
The sauce is delicious and the crust is perfect .
I recommend this place to everyone .
It is run by the same Sichuan chef who started the chain in Chinatown .
Will absolutely visit again .
I was on jury duty , rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome chicken tacos and Hibiscus lemonade .
We arrived for dinner expecting to be impressed by a place that has an impressive past - but , that 's just it -- the PAST !
Owner must have coem on this website to give himself credit .
Dahkin also offers prix fixe lunch and buffet .
The price is reasonable although the service is poor .
I just read Mocaramel 's review and felt compelled to respond .
Dieters stick to salads or indulge in vegetarian platters .
Behind this counter , two men are squeezed in .
In fact , it appears he is going to go postal at any moment .
It was pretty inexpensive too .
The food is amazing !!!!
I 've been many time and have never been disappointed .
But regulars know that the sandwiches are the real star here .
great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer .
I also ordered the Change Mojito , which was out of this world .
My friends and I showed up on a Sat .
less wait time for me !
It can be a very fun experience with a group , and kids ( 6 and over ) would love it .
The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation , so a casual lunch here would probably be best .
Leave the kids at home !
I come from a family of pizzeria owners , and I 'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in Fornino 's blows my families receipies away .
We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves .
On a recent Sunday afternoon , a friend and I accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT .
We arrived and were seated immediately , which made us both happy .
The waiter was attentive , the food was delicious and the views of the city were great .
Went inside and I started to get excited .
You guys are awesome !
I was highly disappointed by their service and food .
this one is definintely my least favorite .
We actually gave 10 % tip ( which we have never done despite mediocre food and service ) , because we felt totally ripped off .
Great for groups , great for a date , great for early brunch or a nightcap .
Great staff .
As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited .
Sometimes tables do n't understand his sense of humor but it 's refreshing to have a server who has personality , professionalism , and respects the privacy of your dinner .
Everyone that has ever come here with me has become a convert and returned regularly with their own friends .
I was so stunned , and I left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing .
The food is great .
The exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations .
Service was very prompt but slightly rushed .
Cuisine is billed as asian fusion - does n't meet the bill .
All in all we 're already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks !!!!
Most of the sandwiches are made with soy mayonaise which is actually pretty good .
Murray wo n't do it .
We were then shooed inside .
Ballato 's is consistently delicious authentic italian food .
This is a great place to take out-of-towners , and perfect for watching the sunset .
There were no communications issues either , as she spoke perfect English .
The staff offers impeccable service .
I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever .
Sushi was n't anything spectacular for the price .
The sauce may not be for everyone , since it is distintive .
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us .
However , go for the ambience , and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world !
The dishes are remarkably tasty and such a cozy and intimate place !
The staff greeted me warmly at the door and I was seated promptly and the food was excellent .
First walking in the place seemed to have great ambience .
i have eaten here a handful of times , for no reason besides sheer convenience .
We would return to this place again !
The rest of the menu is limited by everything is good eats .
The menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked .
For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .
The service was superb , they treat you like family .
And Kruno , the beverage manager is the best bartender I have yet to come across .
If it 's just a quick martini at the bar ( which I recommend Jeffery 's ) or a mind blowing Roast Chicken , go to Village !
The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes .
The staff is very kind and well trained , they 're fast , they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks , they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations .
The food was very good , a great deal , and the place its self was great .
I have eaten at some of the ' best ' sushi joints in NYC ( Nobu , Bond Street , JewelBako , etc ) and Yamato is my favorite .
Service was wonderful ;
Ca n't wait to go back .
The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing !
My daughter and I left feeling satisfied ( not stuffed ) and it felt good to know we had a healthy lunch .
The flavors are great , and the menu is extensive .
Disappointingly , their wonderful Saketini has been taken off the bar menu .
so delicious !!!!!!
Plain and simple it 's bad thai food .
Its located in greenewich village .
It took them 15 minutes to put water in our glasses .
Get the soup and a nosh ( pastrami sandwich ) for $ 8 and you 're golden .
The service is a quite slow , but friendly .
Decor is charming .
We also had shared a house salad that was fresh .
People in the neighborhood seem to love it , too .
It can not be the ambience , because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle .
The tastes makes your mouth water for more .
Do n't be put off by another reviewers extremely negative review .
Do n't get me started on the margaritas , either .
My husband had the mesclun , salmon , and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses .
The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance .
$ 20 for all you can eat sushi can not be beaten .
Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth .
An excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but , the food was slightly disappointing .
Each bite of food at Kai was indeed delicious , fresh , and elegant .
Not worth it .
The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day .
However , once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option ) , I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .
This is the perfect spot for meeting friends , having lunch , dinner , pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks !
I would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices .
If you can handle that , it 's a great place for a business dinner , fun with friends or simply a table for 2 .
The food is very good for it 's price , better than most fried dumplings I 've had .
Another great thing about Glechik-everything is very cheap !
The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent .
Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store .
But , hey , there is anything better with a decent vegetarian selection in Astoria .
I recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal !
Thius is a must for anyone who loves Shabu-Shabu .
since i was in the neighborhood , we made sure to give this a try .
It 's very spicy but not offensive .
My personal favorite is Nick and Joe 's .
Incredible food at a very agreable price brings me back just about every other day to this authentic Thai restaurant .
The staff is also attentive and friendly .
We were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the service was very quick and professional .
So , if yo really do n't care who is sittingnext to you , which is about 2 inches away , I would say try it .
I thought I had died and gone to heaven .
Even though its good seafood , the prices are too high .
Recommendations , of course , are required !
We had Lava Cake ... we ordered when our food came it takes at least a 1/2 to make it .
Stepping into Casa La Femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in New York !
After the main course came , we did n't see our waiter for at least 40 MINUTES !
Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef .
this is the best secret place in midtown ' , I heard that from the bartender , after having brilliant food ( try steak with portobello mushrooms ) and drinks on the bar last Tuesday .
Delicate spices , onions , eggs and a kick-ass roti .
Very " normal Indian food " , but done really well .
An oasis of refinement : Food , though somewhat uneven , often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef 's passion ( and kitchen 's precise execution ) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups .
Both times we waited well over a half hour for a table ( even though we had reservations ) .
But the pizza is way to expensive .
Considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , I expect better service .
( Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer !!!
It is kinda nosiy and the tables are close together but it 's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner .
But who says Murray 's is anything about service .
The bar has various selections and the mixed drink special is a catcher ! 2 for 1 's .
My boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque .
It 's traditional , simple italian food .
Well , this place is so Ghetto its not even funny .
I 'm going back .
I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fine Indian dining experience that is definitely a value for your dollar .
Try the homemade breads .
Jimmy is Dominican !
For starters they delivered us someone else 's order .
The staff has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often .
Loved it !
The music does get a little loud at times , but it just made me want to lean closer to my beautiful wife , and as I did , I got a whiff of corriander .
I found the food to be outstanding , particulary the salmon dish I had .
Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you .
Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away .
In such a crappy part of town to find a good value for lunch , this place is great .
I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one .
Everything is delicious , though , my gf and I come here once a week sometimes - you will get addicted !
The entree was also very good .
Finally let into the store 5 at a time , to buy expensive slices from a harried staff .
A cool bar with great food , and tons of excellent beer .
I have had so many dinners here and it 's always been perfect - on a date with my husband , with my mom , with girlfriends and larger groups .
We shared a bottle of sake , an order of edamames , and she had the sushi plate while I had the sashimi .
This is the BEST Shabu-Shabu Restaurant in the Try-State Area .
We have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and service is given .
We 've been following chef Lyle 's food around New York for 15 years and while remaining classic , his innovations with bistro fare have made us return and return .
Go here .
This place is always very crowded and popular .
Straight-forward , no surprises , very decent Japanese food .
Leon is an East Village gem : casual but hip , with well prepared basic French bistro fare , good specials , a warm and lively atmosphere .
We have lived in Chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant .
we spent 50 $ $ definetly will come back with my friends !!!
If you ' re in New York , you do not want to miss this place .
Definitely worth the trip to Battery Park City !
The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned .
Had we been stalling I could understand where they were coming from , but we had been there less than an hour and they had n't even brought us a check yet !
Avoid this place !
In the evening , this place attracted a well dressed , with it , NY crowd .
When you add it all together , it just does n't seem worth it to me ... especially considering the prices .
It is simply amazing .
Finally , after all the raving I went to check it out with one of my enthusiastic friends this last Saturday night and let me tell you its all its cracked up to be .
There are other people waiting !
their dinner specials are fantastic .
I went to DF for Valentines Day dinner .
Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything .
Whether your choose the iced blended mocha or the hot white mocha you are sure to be extremely happy .
Ambience is so cute and quaint , good for business although we were there on vacation .
Bartender was unable to tear himself away from friends at bar .
I loving bringing friends here - and I do so every chance I get .
We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods .
This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent .
If you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained , this is a great place to go and eat .
I think the stuff was better than Disney .
Food was OK - fish was cooked well .
The pastas are incredible , the risottos ( particularly the sepia ) are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing .
Service not the friendliest to our " large party " !
This time , I prefer not to go into detail .
In China the phrase for a good restaurant is hot and loud .
I would have gotten some cole slaw and a knish if my stomach had more space .
go to any corned indian restaurant , and the little india strip along east 6 st rules supreme !
How do you rate home ?
Now at the top of our list , Del Frisco 's Steakhouse .
Indoor was very cozy and cute .
Not someplace I would seek to try out but if I am in the area again , I will certainly stop by .
by dinner time , they turn it around and mount a huge comeback !!
There 's nice and quiet , small but enough for 6 ( or more ) .
This place has realy fresh sushi and a nice large menu of Japanese classic cuisine .
Great sushi experience .
Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza .
The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the service is excellent and it 's great for friends out , a romantic date , or a special occassion .
We walked in on a Wednesday night and were seated promptly .
It 's a really great deal , considering we got full off of four dollars .
you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review .
Stuffing yourself with Japanese food is a rare thing .
Great Indian food
What you are paying for is the environment and the name .
I am happy i did the food was awsome .
For the price you pay for the food here , you 'd expect it to be at least on par with other Japanese restaurants .
Are you freaking kidding me ?
I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible .
My friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatos .
The place is clean , and if you like soul food , then this is the place to be !
Some of the workers ignore me and talk to the female customers , other times , they 've skipped my order .
The food was delicious ( I had a halibut special , my husband had steak ) , and the service was top-notch .
Meat dishes now adorn the selections , although there 's still a large number of vegetarian-friendly choices .
Salads were fantastic .
Arigato Gozimas Yuka !
It 's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone .
I also ordered the Change Mojito , which was out of this world .
Here 's the thing , you 're in the best city in the world for restaurants .
Food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience ) .
I often find myself with time to kill in Times Square , which is a shame since I do n't love this area .
In reality ( to maximize potential diners ) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby .
Build a meal with side orders like Amazin ' Greens salads , Buffalo Chicken Kickers and Cinna Stix .
Skip this restaurant , it 's a big disappointment .
The frizzy retro girl ( with winged / Dame Edna glasses ) will yell at you if you try to order a drink .
and you ca n't beat the prices .
The lone argentine chorizo appetizer at $ 8.95 was a heavy fennel flavored Italian sausage like the ones that sell for $ 2.99 / lb at the store .
I 've had better chicken at BBQs !!!!
But for the Shabu Shabu , you wo n't find much better in NY .
Ok , so the servers wander around a little clueless , but there 's more than enough servers for the crowd they get -- it 's fine , you just have to make a small effort to get their attention .
The restuarant itself is not large , but seems to have several round tables to accomodate large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic Taiwanese .
I would highly recommend this place to everyone for any occasion !
While the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made Tiffin so attractive , the menu has been overhauled .
There is not a single place in Chinatown where you have a nice neighborhood feeling like here .
I 'm saving up for my next visit .
Service was quick .
My boyfriend had Prime Rib it was good .
I went to Ruby Foos for my birthday and enjoyed our experience there .
We started with lox and mussels ( the best ive ever had , ever ) and had the cod and trout for dinner .
Decor is nice though service can be spotty .
Dessert was also to die for !
The unattractive lighting made me want to gag , the food was overpriced , there was the most awful disco pop duo performing-and my escargot looked like it might crawl off the plate .
The sauce is zesty and flavorful and the crust is nice and crispy .
Worth the trip from Manhattan .
We were told that the wait was about twenty minutes and there would be no problem for our 8:00 pm curtain call .
Also , because it is so thin , it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling .
Fish was overdone .
The menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent .
this place is amazingly bad .
This place is great .
This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money .
I can not imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant .
I went to Kitchenette this weekend for brunch .
The staff is arrogant , the prices are way high for Brooklyn .
The place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening .
It wo n't break the bank but I also wouldnt come back for the food .
The design is very intimate and romantic .
Eat at your own risk .
The food was delicious , the atmosphere was relaxed , and we have now adopted Plate 347 as our Secret on Second !
From the moment you enter till the moment you walk out the friendly and helpful staff was was just Fantastic .
During the course of the past 3 months , the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better .
This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls .
The atmosphere was mostly of an older crowd , but there were a few groups of mid 20 's / 30 year olds also .
BEST DINING EXPERIENCE IN THE WEST VILLAGE !
Everything about this place was wonderful .
This place is not worth the prices .
So , I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it .
The worst excuse for Japanese food I 've ever encountered .
I have tried to make reservations , but both times , the hostess did n't have my name .
I ordered a Lassi and asked 4 times for it but never got it .
Excellent food , although the interior could use some help .
We had our Christmas party at Dos Caminos and it was wonderful .
Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza ( as I love La Pizza Fresca ) .
those rolls were big , but not good and sashimi was n't fresh .
Try the hot dogs too , they 're snappy and delicious .
My mom originally introduced me to this place , but even she ( being Indian ) feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily .
I have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a mushroom consomme - and this chef accomplishes without fats .
Best Italian food I ever had ( and being Italian , that means alot ) .
The place was quiet and delightful .
This place was not ALL THAT !
So we sat at the bar , the bartender did n't seem like he wanted to be there .
But on a lazy Saturday night , we ended up going .
Do n't eat here unless you 're starving for thai food and you work next door .
Great idea and base for restaurant , but work on the details , people who think this was good need to go back to the shore towns and rethink what it should have tasted like .
We went to this restaurant based on prior internet comments .
The food is decent at best , and the ambience , well , it 's a matter of opinion , some may consider it to be a sweet thing , I thought it was just annoying .
And even with it 's Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too !
I found it on a cold night , the perfect spot to warm up .
Wow over 100 beers to choose from .
Everyone I have spoken too there is super friendly , helpful , and willing to the extra mile for a customer .
now if they could only get a toaster .
Fish is so very fresh .
The food is good .
However , for what we spent , overall , it just was not up to par .
Eating in , the atmosphere saves it , but at your desk , it 's a very disappointing experience .
The food is excellent !
It might have been a little too spicy for my friend , which you can couteract with eat more rice and keeping water on hand .
My boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque .
After my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer .
Save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one !
You ca n't go wrong here .
( $ 200 for 2 glasses of champagne , not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks ) .
THEY HAVE WAITERS ON THE SIDEWALK TRYING TO PULL YOU IN WHICH MADE US SUSPICIOUS .
We live in New Jersey and whenever we go into New York City we buy bagels to eat hot and then to freeze ( they told me that if I call in the order , they 'd bring it out to the car so I would n't have to look for parking ) .
Not a small feat for good french food in the area .
The prices are wonderfully low .
The sauce on the pizza is sooo good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they do n't skimp .
The spicy tuna and salmon are the best we 've ever had .
I live nearby and when they first opened , I ate there a lot .
But if you 're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary , then this is the place to go for Indian food
Not terrible , but not the restaurant in the reviews of 2002 .
We had a wonderful meal at Naples 45 a month ago on a visit to NYC .
I 'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food .
A great choice at any cost and a great deal .
During our meal , the management came over and checked on us and even bought us a round of drinks .
If you are a carnivore , come hungry and you will leave more satisfied than you have ever been .
I just read Mocaramel 's review and felt compelled to respond .
I grew up on these bagels .
Interior was so so .
Being Puerto Rican I know a thing or two about flan and this place serves one of the best ( I hope Mom does n't read this ! ) .
The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees .
I HATE HATE HATE this place .
Although small , it has beautiful ambience , excellent food ( the catfish is delicious - if ya do n't mind it a lil salty ) and attentive service .
Maybe tomorrow ; - )
Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant .
If you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde .
I felt as though I were eating in Paris .
I 'm not picky - but it was actually gross .
A very inviting restaurant , with friendly service .
The corned beef was tender and melted in my mouth .
I would definitely recommend Mary 's and am making it one of my regular neighborhood haunts .
Take a good sense of humor , an American express card with no limit , walk out with a lollipop , gift bag in hand and enough marketing materials for alain to to take the show on the road
we love th pink pony .
I would recommend putting your name down and then getting a drink at a local bar first though because of the wait time .
Chinese Desserts are known for healthful benefits in addition to the sweetness .
Check it out , it wo n't hurt your stomach or your wallet .
The atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking , which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors .
Highly recommend it !
I was there on sat .
But that was n't the icing on the cake : a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had .
The service varys from day to day - sometimes they 're very nice , and sometimes not .
I have to say they have one of the fastest delivery times in the city .
They have an excellent selection ( the rolls with crab are really great ) .
Vanison was good but not amazing .
The food now is inconsistent .
If you wrote a bad review , it 's because you do n't understand what Rao 's is all about .
Unfortunately , the food is outstanding , but everything else about this restaurant is the pits .
Solid wine list , knowledgeable staff , friendly owners and an adventurous , ever-changing menu keep us coming back .
Service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded .
The wait staff was very attentive and polite .
Wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well !
In fact , while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu , and I could n't help telling them that the food was horrible .
With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering , the food here was decent , not great .
As I made the title , it 's an affordable restaurant for great taste .
The food 's dazzling flavors overwhelm the palate , truly embracing the beauty of authentic Thai cuisine .
The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great .
First of all Dal Bukhara Rocks .
Amazing !
He takes real pride in his food and his business .
Fluke sashimi drizzled with jalapeno-lime olive oil , the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish 's sweetness .
None of that yucky whipped stuff .
Service was very friendly .
Other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced , the atmosphere is filled with energy ( and the beautiful people of course ) and the food was surprising good !
The price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate .
That place was awesome , , , sally !
Chef Waldy 's always measures up .
Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES , I get angry that I did n't just go to Zucchero Pomodori .
It is expensive but well worth the money .
His response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening .
Acceptable prices .
I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart 's for their food , the ambience and wonderful service .
Outstanding Bagels , but you get what you pay for .
Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu , though - too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick .
This place is worth an one-hour drive .
The counter service is bad .
Filled with suits , though , so you never really feel terribly comfortable .
It 's a great place to order from or sit-in .
As we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were .
Hurley 's is like Cheers where everyone knows your name and they are ACTUALLY glad you came .
Good spreads , great beverage selections and bagels really tasty .
Will absolutely visit again .
This place was reccomended to me by a friend .
Also they were $ 15 each !
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice .
I will be back !
I 'm not sure why these other reviewers are whining so much .
We ordered dosut bibimbap and nakgi-bokum .
Excellent spot for holiday get togethers with co-workers or friends that you have n't seen in a while .
To top it all off . . the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant .
The food is top notch , the service is attentive , and the atmosphere is great .
The staff was very attentive , the ambience lovely , and the food superb .
They 're rude at times , and not very friendly .
Tell them Herky sent you and get a free confused look from the waiter .
Kind , attentive wait staff .
Finally !
The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices .
Best Indian Restaurant in the City
Great friendly service , Fast seating , Fast Delivery , Excellent sushi .
So , if you 're walking by and thinking about dining , you might want to see who 's going to be seating you first ...
Unfortunately , we chose this spot for lunch as we had done a lot of walking and ended up at the South St Seaport .
Reliable , Fresh Sushi
The french fries -- with the kalmata dip were terrific !
I was very disappointed with this restaurant .
The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty .
I went with JWILS .
Bill a little high , but worth it .
The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the service is excellent and it 's great for friends out , a romantic date , or a special occassion .
Went to Village last night for my birthday .
Raga stands out with an interesting fusion of French and Indian cooking .
Ruby Foo 's is a tourist trap .
Never fails to please .
The Four Seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of New York City restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say " I 've been to the four seasons restaurant " .
It took a bigger bite from my wallet than my appetite - I would not reccomend this to anyone that I would want to talk to me again !!
He offers subpar service and has no personality .
They are served with a free appetizer and the portions are perfect for lunch .
i have eaten here on a different occasion - the food is mediocre for the prices .
The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale .
I agree .
The food was average to above-average ; the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive , and the desserts not brilliant in any way .
For me dishes a little oily , but overall dining experience good .
My friends and I came across this place while walking in the village .
The staff has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often .
Really though , where 's the seasoning ?
We ate here in March , 2006 and ordered the pre-theatre 3-course dinner with wine flight .
I have to say the place was awesome .
everyone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful .
if you 're daring , try the balsamic vinegar over icecream , it 's wonderful !
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!
The first time the sushi was outstanding , the second time it was a little bland .
Even though the place is not beautiful , the food speaks for itself .
it 's the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food .
Dumbfoundingly Poor
The service is outstanding and my crab-cake eggs benedict could not have been better .
SUM IT : local investment bankers like it , try for yourself at least once .
The food here does a great service to the name ( Cantonese that is ... ) .
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .
Enjoy !!!
Next time , we would n't dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks .
My roommate and I LOVE this place .
Skip Nathan 's ... you can get that at the mall ... go to Bark .
Also they were $ 15 each !
I recommend to anyone who wants to dress up and impress the lady .
The food is terrible and overall , I would have to say avoid at all costs .
The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious , if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini .
The food is amazing , rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza .
As much as I like the food there , I ca n't bring myself to go back .
I 've been coming here on and off for the past five years and I have to say that La Lanterna has never , ever dissapointed me .
No doubt the next time we want to go out for a special occasion or are entertaining guests from out of town , Spirit and Bateaux will be our destination .
Once you try it for a special occasion beware . . you ca n't stop !
The prices can not be beat for the quality , quantity , freshness and taste .
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty ( could 've used a bit more salt ) .
Tried the pad see ew on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it 's one of my favorite dishes .
The establishment scores big points in presentation and style .
Perfectly al dente pasta , not drowned in sauce -- generous portions .
We 've never had any problems with the staff but maybe we 've been lucky ?
The food itself was just ok - nothing spectacular - but the service was awful .
The service varys from day to day - sometimes they 're very nice , and sometimes not .
When you 're sitting in their main dining room ( which has a spectacular , hand-painted high ceiling ) you 'd never know there was a world outside .
People dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans .
The appetizers are ok , but the service is slow .
And really large portions .
Overall , not worth the money .
great toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost !
Whatever the reason it is definitely the place to be .
Raga 's is a romantic , cozy restaurant .
word of advice , save room for pasta dishes and never leave until you 've had the tiramisu .
The restaurant was packed at first , so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated .
Obviously run by folks who know a pie .
NO PIZZA 33 for me !
Not cheap , but not that expensive either .
. the best I 've found outside of the Chinatown masters .
Edible but really a ripoff at those prices given whats in the area .
From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff , I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it .
The rice to fish ration was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice .
I asked for seltzer with lime , no ice .
There was a long wait for a table outside , but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice .
We all agreed that mare is one of the best seafood restaurants in New York .
However , our main course was wonderful .
The service was excellent and the food was delicious .
That is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish , and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste .
It is terrific , as is the value .
My six year old loved it .
This place has many different styles of pizza and they are all amazing .
When we stumbled on Leon , we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT , we were certainly wrong .
However , I think this place is a good hang out spot .
It was huge , delicious , fresh , and will be the reason we return .
The wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for Chinatown ) alternative .
I 'm glad I did as the food was very good and the staff was friendly , courteous and efficient .
Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you .
The food is authentic Italian - delicious !
Moules were excellent , lobster ravioli was VERY salty !
Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting .
Also , do n't plan on asking for your favorite roll , if it 's not on the menu , you ca n't have it .
It is the best hidden spot there and I rave about it to everyone .
One of us actually liked the expresso - that 's it .
It is not worth for that bucks .
Great neighborhood joint .
This is the Jackel and Hideof the restaurants on the UES .
The strong scents coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds .
I had the best ravioli ever .
My GF and I dine at Bukhara often as she lives near it .
Ca n't wait to go back .
But I just would like to say I read the reviews people left and thats why I checked it out .
The only drawback is that it 's a little pricey .
Prices are higher to dine in and their chicken tikka marsala is quite good .
You ca n't say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown .
A large is $ 20 , and toppings are about $ 3 each .
They have some great entrees here as well .
If you live in Upper Manhattan , Siam Square is THE place for Thia food .
There is a real gallery of stars that have visited .
Drawbacks : service is slow and they do n't toast !
But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere , delightfully free of the BTs .
My suggestion is to eat family style because you 'll want to try the other dishes .
The service is good and the resturant is clean .
Was there Friday night .
From the entrees to the sides to the drinks , everything was creatively prepared yet still simple .
All toppings are so fresh you 'd think they had their own vegetable garden and the crust is so perfect , that one actually thinks of how it was made .
I was n't here for the pizza so I ca n't comment on that yet but what I had was very good .
The dim sum servings here are a bit larger than I 'm used to .
The portions of the food that came out were mediocre .
After that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it !!!!!!!!!!!!
otherwise , good stuff for late nite eats .
The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day .
To be honest we only ever eat the Shabu Shabu .
its a little out of the way if you do n't live in the neighborhood , but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are .
I 've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious .
Easily the worst stir-fried squid I 've ever tasted .
One caveat : Some of the curried casseroles can be a trifle harsh .
The service was great as well .
I loved it .
The food really is n't very good and the service is terrible .
The atmosphere is much better than Sripraphai ( more modern and sleek ) .
My co-workers had to wait almost an hour for delivery , only to discover that what they got was not what they ordered .
Its an excellent place to relax and the food is one of the best in the city of New York .
There 's nice and quiet , small but enough for 6 ( or more ) .
I have taken practically every guest that has come to visit me in NY and hooked a few New Yorkers onto Peep as well .
My wife had barely touched that mess of a dish .
Service was slow , but the people were friendly .
Waitstaff is great , very attentive .
The waiter was attentive .
Service was prompt , friendly and great .
The waiters ALWAYS look angry and even ignore their high-tipping regulars .
One of my favorite places in Manhattan .
Not pretentious and very economical .
A little crowded but they move that line really fast !
The dishes offered were unique , very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages , sardines with biscuits , large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream ( the best and freshest I 've ever had ) .
For years , I thought Tuscan cuisine was the best , but Salvatore converted me to the hearty Neapolitan fare on my first visit .
Go , go , hurry , before everyone finds out about it .
Ruth , mother of the Bride
My boyfriend and I have been to The Minnow four times now and we have consistently been impressed .
Each time we 've been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return .
Drinks got screwed up , she acted put upon .
Nice for one time special occasion .
I ate here for the first time and absolutely loved it !
I can say that the wraps , burgers and salads were all fresh , tasty and the mango margareta at $ 9 was WELL WORTH the money .
I have known about this secret for the last 13 years , Emilio ( the Godfather ) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices .
While this is a pretty place in that overly cute French way , the food was insultingly horrible .
Great wine selection , Gigondas is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value .
Arigato Gozimas Yuka !
Good drink .
Ive been to many Thai restaurants in Manhattan before , and Toons is by far the best Thai food Ive had ( except for my mom 's of course ) .
Had no flavor and the staff is rude and not attentive .
The place was n't too hard to find , but it was kind of packed , as soon as my boyfriend and I got our food , the line reached the door .
We arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly.The
I am so coming back here again , as much as I can .
Cool atmosphere , the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night .
The floor was wet , the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor , no soap , and no hand towels left .
It 's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we 've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years .
While the menu is n't especially groundbreaking , everything I 've tried so far has been well-executed and tasty .
I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of .
Faan is sooo good .
Weekends can get crowded , but still highly recommended .
Took my sister here before attending a show one evening .
( and I have eaten my share ) Which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to serve .
Atmosphere is nice and relaxed too ...
While the ambiance and atmosphere were great , the food and service could have been a lot better .
I read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself , but may be it is worth it .
This restaurant was way overhyped .
I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try .
The fried rice is amazing here .
The dosas are skimpy , unattractive and drip with grease , and personally I 'd drink popcorn topping before I 'd eat another one of these .
Not enough wines by the glass either .
We have been to this place many times , and always have great food , wine , and service .
We were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks .
The food however , is what one might expect .
I care more about the food and ambience .
As soon as my father lifted his pen from the check a chef appeared to usher us out .
I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork .
Always great service !
BUt their best dish is thh Thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a dish that would cost $ 23.95 is most places , but it is $ 16 here .
The entree was bland and small , dessert was not inspired .
For all you lazy folks that do n't want to come to Alphabet City , I say , good - stay out .
I love the Little Pie Company as much as anyone else who has written reviews , but must discourage anyone from visiting the Grand Central location due to their RUDE service from two sales people .
The service is not consistently excellent -- just decent .
it is a hidden delight complete with a quaint bar and good food .
Average cake thats been courted by a LOT of hype .
Try the sea bass .
It was such a fantastic dining experience , that I returned again the same week .
And really large portions .
They do n't concern much of customer 's health , just want to make money .
First of all , this place is * not * romantic , as claimed by Citysearch 's editorial review .
If you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo .
We happened upon this place purely by accident and were pleased with the results .
Our son loves pizza and we have a certified Neapolitan pizzaria in our home city ( Seattle ) , we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant .
I have been coming to this neighborhood spot for years .
Our waitress was sweet and accomodating , not overbearing .
Delicious food , excellent service , and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $ 5.99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch !
The wine list is excellent .
Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated , we were served dishes we had n't ordered three times , received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served ( and that order was undercooked ) , and charged $ 45 more than we should have been on our bill .
from an English speaking staff .
Overall , not worth the money .
The portions are HUGE , so it might be good to order three things to split ( rather than one appetizer and entree per person ) for two people .
You will find everything about Trio to your liking !
WE ENDED UP IN LITTLE ITALY IN LATE AFTERNOON .
The food is good , especially their more basic dishes , and the drinks are delicious .
We try frequenting new restaurants all over the city , but any time that we visit a restaurant other than Roth 's we are always disappointed .
The music which is sometimes a little too heavy for my taste .
Two people in our party felt like something else , and Volare immediately obliged with two great dishes that were not in their regular menu .
Nice atmosphere , the service was very pleasant and the desert was good .
It was n't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it 's simply repulsive .
Paul , the maitre d' , was totally professional and always on top of things .
The food is good , I ca n't lie .
The food is great , service is ok .
We all felt it was worth it .
but overall i give it a 10
If you are a Tequila fan you will not be disappointed .
If you like the food and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants , this is not the place for you .
With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering , the food here was decent , not great .
Every waitress and customer who passed by me bumped into my chair .
The flavors robust and subtle .
The pizza was pretty good and huge .
Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place .
Anyway , the owner was fake .
I love it .
We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods .
The food was just OK , I would never go back .
This place is so much fun .
Bleecker St Pizza is the best !
Going to Bark is always worth the train ride , and will make your tongue and belly very happy !
None was made so i hung up .
A little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite .
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose .
If you 're looking to taste some great Indian food and want good service , definitely visit Curry Leaf .
My Chelsea 's impressive and creative menu includes modern , Westernized Japanese dishes such as Foie Gras Unagi Napolean , Jap style hamburger steak , spicy cod roe spaghetti , black cod with miso base , and rack of lamb in black truffle sauce , to name a few .
My six year old loved it .
The service is ok , some of the people did n't get what they asked for .
I would highly recommend this place !
The food is uniformly exceptional , with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating , whether it 's on the menu or not .
Was her Monday for lunch - was working on a film in the area - and found this rare jewel .
The food is wonderful , artfully done and simply delicious .
They were such a rip-off ( $ 8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns ) and not worth trying .
happy to be a regular at this place and would warmly recommend it to anyone .
I started going to dosa hut more after that .
The omlette for brunch is great ...
I have been in NYC for over 10 years and could not find this delicacy east of the Hudson .
The food is good , I ca n't lie .
One of the more authentic Shanghainese restaurants in the US definitely the best in Manhattan Chinatown .
I would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices .
Oh right , I should probably say something nice .
I recommend the jelly fish , drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings , certainly the stir fry blue crab .
The decor is very simple but comfortable .
i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family .
I thought this place was totally overrated .
The svc can be a bit rude at times , esp if you have big group , but overall the restaurant is a must !
The food was actually aweful .
My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better .
I started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two .
Bagels are ok , but be sure not to make any special requests !
Everyone who works there ( the host , the bartender , the servers ) is so helpful .
For the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated .
They might be all business at the counter when you give your order , but their food says I love you .
The service was attentive , yet discreet .
the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside .
Planet Thai is great !
Skip this location and go to the one in Soho .
I expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu .
The ambience is very calm and quiet .
Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
It 's very spicy but not offensive .
Be careful , when they say spicy , they mean it !
My only problem is that you are literally sitting on top of the people next to you !
Subtle food and service
I noticed alot of indian people eatting there which is a great sign for an indian place !
The food was excellent as well as service , however , I left The Four Seasons very dissappointed .
It is LOUD , HOT and DARK .
Baluchi 's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices .
You 'll adore it .
However , there is just something so great about being outdoors , in great landscaping , enjoying a casual drink that makes going to this place worthwhile .
You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert .
Amma has the worst value for money I have experienced in NYC over the past 2 years .
Bukhara Grill , the tagline says it all . . " INDIAN SPICE RAVE "
I love it .
Avoid at all costs .
A con was the slow bar service .
Our waiter was horrible ; so rude and disinterested .
I 'd definitely recommend this little place .
They are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in Yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey .
I ca n't imagine how much worse it would have been if we 'd gone at a prime time !
Did I mention the wine ?
Good food at the right price , what more can you ask for .
They make the best pizza in New Jersey .
Really .
When my husband and go there , we spend $ 60.00 ( have LOBSTER TAILS UMMMMM need I say more ) I ca n't say any more , it a place you 'll never forget If you never go , you 'll miss A Meal of your life time
The staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York .
SO GOOD
The two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place .
The food was excellent - authentic Italian cuisine made absolutely fresh .
We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town .
Service is not exactly five star , but thats not really a big deal .
We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria , but facing away from the bar when we turned back around , the $ 2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it .
Again , if you are in this neighborhood - by all means , come here .
It is very overpriced and not very tasty .
I love this place !
DO not try unless you 're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste .
Service is not what you are coming here for ...
Favorite Sushi in NYC
The sushi is reasonably priced and fresh .
On a monthly basis my friends and I get together and have a girls night out .
Too bad Latin Quarters closed .
As a fan of Thai , I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst .
I actually gave Patroon another chance before writing this , but the second visit was even worse .
They specialize in smoothies and fresh juices .
The food was terrific and the service classy , attentive , without being overbearing .
Because of the delicate thin crust , take-out pies get soggy in their boxes .
The service , however , was a bright flower in a garden .
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm .
As a fan of Thai , I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst .
My friends settled for rice dishes , but we came back the following day to try the dim sum , which was good ... not outstanding , but good .
They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another .
So some of the reviews here are accurate about the crowd and noise .
He ca n't help , they 're bought up so fast .
Our food was great too !
Loved it !
Do n't leave without trying One Night in Tokyo .
And amazingly cheap .
Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos .
They were such a rip-off ( $ 8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns ) and not worth trying .
The view is spectacular , and the food is great .
Best of all is the warm vibe , the owner is super friendly and service is fast .
The food was very good , but not very thai .
To my right , the hostess stood over a busboy and hissed rapido , rapido as he tried to clear and re-set a table for six .
try the spicy shrimp appetizer ( again , not the greatest value in the world but worth the price ) and the lamb vindaloo is great .
good variety but nothing surprising .
It 's better than being on the roof of Sutton Place with 19 year old interns jabbing you in the ribs all night .
i recommend the thai popcorn : )
What came to our table was burned beyond recognition and stringy .
good selection of wines ranging from affordable to high end .
This place is a great stop for great food .
The $ 72 Delmonico steak had to be sent back because it was not cooked to order .
You can get an excellent meal at most of the many Indian restaurants on nearby Lexington Avenue for the cost of one the dainty dishes here .
Nothing fancy but really good food with pretty reasonable price .
If you do n't like it , I do n't know what to tell you .
To me it exemplifies Soho , cute , artsy , interesting .
Everyone was more then happy with his choices .
I had a great experience .
Service is friendly , prices are good - delivery time was a little slow , but for the way this pizza tastes , I 'm willing to overlook it .
Ok , for all of us growing up in the Village of NYC , we have spoiled by a plethora of restaurants , most of which stay open very late .
too large for just two people but nothing was left .
A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning !
The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food .
The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that .
The waitress was not attentive at all .
I like Mamoun 's food as well , but side by side , Kati Rolls just produce tastier food hands down .
After dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : Where are you from ... maybe you dont know how things work in America ... and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on .
