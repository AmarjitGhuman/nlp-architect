The service is ok but could be better .
It 's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre food , noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks .
We went to Ino for Valentines .
This place is incredibly tiny .
This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart 's and I must say how delicous the food and the service was .
For a Fabulous Wedding !
Gross food – Wow -
I am going to the mid town location next .
Ca n't argue about that , but they are clearly over priced .
The bartender on my most recent visit was so incredibly rude that I will never go back .
The sauce is excellent ( very fresh ) with dabs of real mozzarella .
Fresh , authentic , french cuisine in substantial portions .
It has been my first choice ever since I discovered it .
We saw them heating up at least one frozen item though I 'm not sure which dim sum dish it was .
Great food but the service was dreadful !
The food 's as good as ever .
Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn .
cirspy crust margherita pizza
Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $ 10 .
Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner
would NOT go back .
I thought this place was totally overrated .
It 's the conversations that make this a fun place to be .
The well mannered , pleasant staff that Tony has in his employ .
You will not be disapointed at all .
Our server checked on us maybe twice during the entire meal .
When we sat , we got great and fast service .
The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger , to steak , to escargot .
Stumbled upon this gem of a pizza place and I will be going back frequently .
You must try the garlic soup !
While we thoroughly enjoyed the food , it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation .
The sushi is cut in blocks bigger than my cell phone .
After dinner , take your date to the HUGE dance floor , probably one of the biggest you 'll see in NY .
There are other Vietnamese restaurants in the chinatown area and you can forget about those .
Even after a few bad evenings at Bardolino , I keep coming back .
A mix of students and area residents crowd into this narrow , barely there space for its quick , tasty treats at dirt-cheap prices .
Example is the soup which was about 6 oz for $ 12 dollars and the mushrooms where $ 12 for about 1oz .
Has the warmth of a family local yet it is a great place to watch sporting events .
On the recommendation of a friend , I checked out Arezzo with my wife .
It just was n't Thai .
Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town !
When the main course finally arrived ( another 45mins ) half of our order was missing .
I have been in many restaurants all over the city and Roth 's Steakhouse has quickly become one of my favorites .
They charge $ 6.00 for rice .
If we were to move from the upper east side , we would genuinely miss this restaurant .
Fabulous food - if the front of house staff do n't put you off –
Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids .
Make sure you try this place as often as you can .
Go to son cubano in edgewater nj instead .
The food is spectacular , from the appitizers to the main course , and then of course the desserts , ( WOW ) you 'll need no more .
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place .
We were told that they were booked solid and no other table was available .
I try my best to give an accurate description of any establishment visited .
The menu , which changes seasonally , shows both regional and international influences .
For authentic Thai food , look no further than Toons .
the mushroom barley soup is amazing .
It will be on my to do list the next visit to NYC .
Interesting other dishes for a change include chicken in curry sauce and salmon caserole .
His food is excellent ( and not expensive by NYC standards - no entrees over $ 30 , most appetizers $ 12 to 14 ) .
Stick to the gulab jamun .
and never strayed .
The calamari comes with an incredible sauce , and the duck noodles are yummy as well .
With all the mundane or mediocre places on 8th avenue it is nice to have one that is a step above in quaility and atmosphere .
You must try Odessa stew or Rabbit stew ; salads-all good ; and kompot is soo refreshing during the hot summer day ( they make it the way my mom does , reminds me of home a lot ) .
If you 're craving some serious indian food and desire a cozy ambiance , this is quite and exquisite choice .
just got back from lunch at Tamarind and it was excellent .
It hits the spot every time
My first time there I happened not to like the Crab Croquette apt that i ordered and they were happy to change it for me without making no big deal .
Prices even outside of restaurant week were great .
Searching to get out from the cold , freezing weather , we went into what we thought was a deli .
Best restaurant in Brooklyn
Largest and freshest pieces of sushi , and delicious !
Despite the 5th ave address there are no frills whick I also love .
The ambience was so fun , and the prices were great , on top of the fact that the food was really tasty .
The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful .
The service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing .
There is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me .
The BEST Chinese food Uptown !
I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere !
He not only makes his own homemade mozzarella , but every pie is ultra fresh .
$ 500 included :
The portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter .
Not the greatest sushi place , but excellent for a $ 19.95 all you can eat .
Great bagels made the old-fashioned way .
They seemed to continue to rush us along , taking plates without asking if we were done ( my sister still had her fork in hand ) .
The one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side .
The bagels are fabulous .
The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner .
I 'll being with a couple of positives : cool decor , good pita and hummus , and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty .
We ordered a tuna melt - it came with out cheese which just made it a tuna sandwich .
The service was attentive .
Decor is charming .
during busy hrs , i recommend that you make a reservation .
All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends !
If you want to save some money , do n't go here .
Even though its good seafood , the prices are too high .
How pretentious and inappropriate for MJ Grill to claim that it provides power lunch and dinners !
Too bad I had paid an extra $ 2 for the stone bowl .
during happy hour !
I 'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !
After waiting for almost an hour , the waiter brusquely told us he 'd forgotten to give the kitchen our order .
Went with mommy ( the only person who could afford taking me here ) .
I 'm glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in NY .
I usually get one the Vietnamese Beef Noodle Soup .
Coming from Boston this place is like Emma 's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge ( although they have more funky toppings ! )
Too bad the food was n't of the same heritage .
An excellent choice in midtown .
When we arrived at 6:00 PM , the restaurant was practically empty .
MMmmm ... it was delicious .
Ciao Bella
There are numerous shavue restaurants in LA , but few out here .
This place is the most Japanese it can ever get .
If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible !
The family seafood entree was very good .
The skillfully chosen Portuguese cheese cart paired with quality port provides the perfect Iberian ending .
I choose to go with one of the special , the braised lamb shank in red wine , which was excellent .
Everything is always cooked to perfection , the service is excellent , the decor cool and understated .
A narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters , a great deal of mess ( stacks of bottles , cans ) and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees .
The waitstaff are all very busy , it 's not outstanding service , but I 've never been dealt with rudely .
Little Tonino 's is just awesome , our favorite delivery place in Kennsington , honestly the best Gnochi I have ever had !
On a recent Saturday night , I was with a group of 5 at the Bread Bar .
believe us , we 've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs .
Also , the hostess called me today to thank us for coming and mentioned how she hoped that my girlfriend enjoyed her birthday - unexpected , but a truly above and beyond thing to do ...
And as SOON as one person is done , she asked to pick up the plate immediately .
It is set far from the small street it 's on , and there is no traffic noise .
So , again , give it a try .
brick oven gallery is My pick for best pizza restaurant anywhere .
I highly recommend this restaurant !!
Will never be back .
While the staff at this little bistro is very friendly , I have never experienced more incompetency .
Food is excellent .
I 've enjoyed 99 % of the dishes we 've ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional too-authentic-for-me dish ( I 'm a daring eater but not THAT daring ) .
also it 's great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable place , the service it 's just perfect ... they 're so frendly that we never want to live the place !
Hands down the best pizza on the planet .
I am happy i did the food was awsome .
It was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York , and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to New York .
SEA has become so popular that they 've let it go to their heads .
When I called this morning , I did n't think I would be able to get in at 12 , but I was able to get in , along with four other guests .
BUT not in a good way .
Service is highly refined : our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress .
The meat dishes were only so-so .
After all that , they complained to me about the small tip .
Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else .
I ca n't believe people complain about no cheese sticks ?
Well , their deliveries take for ever and the food is usually cold .
The people with carts of food do n't understand you because they do n't speak English , their job is to give you the delicious food you point at .
I do n't like Indian food too much and this was delicious , however you want to factor that into the equation .
The food was absolutely horrible !
The best part of the experience was knowing that the manager ( a bubbly , friendly young woman with a great smile ) truly cared about how we were doing .
I had roast chicken and a salad .
Still , any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house ...
I do n't get it , what 's so special about Prune ?
The food was so-so .
I have gone back to Siam Square many times since and everytime I am very satisfied overall .
Food was average and creme brulee was awful - the sugar was charred , not caramelized and smelled of kerosene .
The service is good and the resturant is clean .
I was pleasantly suprised .
it is not consistent .
Fish is so very fresh .
Creative dishes like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette and fettuccine with grilled seafood in a rosemary-orange sauce are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable bistro menu .
I love Ess-a-bagel , but I live on the west side , so I often go to Murray 's for convenience .
Quality ingredients preparation all around , and a very fair price for NYC .
The food was just OK , at least for what food was available .
My wife and I visited Dokebi tonight .
Very pleased
These innovators of french indian fusion do a great job of making dishes as interesting as possible while still being accessible .
This is the BEST Shabu-Shabu Restaurant in the Try-State Area .
I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .
The overall price tag was very very expensive , something I did expect .
The waiter actually poured water on my hand and walked away .
The bagel was huge .
Went there for an office lunch .
Even though the restaurant was packed , we were seated promptly and even asked for a table upstairs with no problems .
I thought going to Jimmys would give me a real Domincan exprience .
Next time , we would n't dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks .
Good for a quick sushi lunch .
On that scale , it 's a world-beater .
The caeser salad was great .
Just remember , the later you go , the longer you may have to wait .
While they keep the capex to a minimum , they do put some cash into the bagels , because they among the best in the city .
The food was very well prepared .
I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll .
Delivery is fast too .
The wait staff is very friendly , if not overly efficient .
The food is very good too but for the most part , it 's just regular food , nothing special .
The sushi is amazing !!!
It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy , creamy , and slightly buttery .
Look foward to trying the Ruben upon returning .
Yes , I ate the food , but I certainly would not have if I had seen the maggot before eating , and I was at this point fairly sick to my stomach .
The staff was accomodating , the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely .
The spicy mussels are a highlight .
When you 're sitting in their main dining room ( which has a spectacular , hand-painted high ceiling ) you 'd never know there was a world outside .
Get the pepperoni - YUM - and a family style salad .
we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant , then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers .
We had a very nice time .
Ca n’t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients .
I have been to Casimir over 5 times and I have always had a great time there .
This is a great Thai restaurant with a very friendly staff .
Well worth the trip , close to City Hall and downtown subway stops .
We were pleasantly greeted .
Thank you everyone at Water 's Edge .
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested .
I read about this place in Time Out magazine .
Priced at upper intermediate range .
The food is great and the environment is even better .
My order is on my table even on a busy friday night within 10 minutes ( at the most ) of hanging up the phone .
Gigino 's in Wagner Park is so enjoyable .
Unfortunately , with our show tickets , we did n't have time to sample any desserts .
Excellent food for great prices
They have homemade pastas of all kinds -- I recommend the gnocchi -- yum !
My wife and I always enjoy the young , not always well trained but nevertheless friendly , staff , all of whom have a story .
We were pleasantly surprised .
Super friendly and knowledgable staff , fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz ( the chilaquiles were awesome !
The food is good , but very expensive for the casualness of it .
Coffee is a better deal than overpriced Cosi sandwiches .
The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music , and moreover , takes requests .
When I visited my friend who lives in the Upper Eastside , she recommended that we go to this restaurant .
I loved it and would go again .
I 've been frequenting The Tasting Room since it first arrived in the East Village and I 've never been disappointed .
I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night .
THE BIG COMPLAINT : NO TOASTING AVAILABLE .
I had the mango chicken and i ca n't go on to tell you how delicious that was and the presentation was beatiful .
A great way to make some money is to buy a case of snapple from Costco and sell it right outside for only $ 2.50 .
Do n't judge this place prima facie , you have to try it to believe it , a home away from home for the literate heart .
Definitely a neighborhood favorite .
I 've eaten at all three locations and I always love , love the food , the service is always wonderful and the prices are really reasonable .
The pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere .
Right off the major deegan you get ladies from all over the city .
I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst .
Deliveries often take up to an hour and the prices are higher than most other pizzerias in the area .
What a great place .
Maitre-D - " Eat and get out "
I would like to return and try some of the other menu items when I do n't have to rush off to a show .
Veal Parmigana - Better than Patsy 's !
This is my favorite Italian restaurant in all of New York City .
However , it is jus too good to not praise it .
Regardless , we 'll be back and ca n't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio .
For a savory take on the soup and sandwich meal , try the hot and sour soup .
PERFECT FOR DATES !
The fish was really , really fresh .
If that 's a problem , go to McDonald 's and destroy your insides .
What generous portions !
Given the incredible architecture surrounding it , this place has no character .
A real dissapointment .
Appetizers are somewhere around $ 7 each and the main dishes are between $ 11 and $ 16 .
The food was below average , the service was pathetic , there was no ambience at all .
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny .
The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music , and moreover , takes requests .
Besides , we were on vacation !
Casa La Femme is to middle eastern dining what Chuckie Cheeze is to italian .
The food we ordered was excellent , although I would n't say the margaritas were anything to write home about .
This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it .
Try green curry with vegetables .
First of all Dal Bukhara Rocks .
night without a reservation , we had to wait at the bar for a little while , but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience .
Went there last night for 2 year anniversery , and was n't all that impressed .
It 's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street .
first it took us a long time to find the place .
the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality .
The staff is very sharp and they look good too .
It took 100 years for Parisi to get around to making pizza ( at least I do n't think they ever made it before this year ) ... but it was worth the wait .
We were n't !
Our waitress had apparently never tried any of the food , and there was no one to recommend any wine .
I reccomend the fried pork dumplings , the orange chicken/beef , and the fried rice .
They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great .
No apologies during restaurant week .
Even when the chef is not in the house , the food and service are right on target .
Believe me , they live up to the name .
They tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter , so i 'm looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it .
I can not imagine you not rushing out to eat there .
The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard .
And it was quick which is very important .
We arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly .
Sapphire is the only Indian restaurant I go to when I 'm in NYC .
I 've dined at Alain Ducasse 's restaurant in Monte Carlo for half the price for the same excellent dining experience .
Yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken .
The food now is inconsistent .
We had tons of great food , wine , and desserts .
However , the food and service and dramatically lacking .
If you live in new york city , you 'll find better food at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount .
Thick fries , meaty chili and stuffed baked potatoes round out a menu that includes a cool , ultra-thick chocolate Frosty .
Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll .
Only suggestion is that you skip the dessert , it was overpriced and fell short on taste .
I went at 6:00 PM specifically for the pre-theater menu ( $ 19.95 for roasted tomato soup with chevre , steak frites , creme brulee ) and it was marvelous .
The sake ’s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world .
It can be a little confusing as to where one goes to order , but once the food is ordered , you are in for a treat .
The DJ is awesome , I have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and I keep going back .
My entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid , and was unnecessarily heated with a burner .
If you venture off the island of Manhattan and ca n't seem to find a great Italian restaurant , drive to Corona .
The dessert ( we had a pear torte ) was good - but , once again , the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions .
Meat-phobes are in luck with the extraordinary veggie burger , made from a distinctive blend of chickpeas , carrots and other vegetables and spices .
The Yellowtail was particularly good as well .
I will be going back and heartily recommend it !
Having hunted around for a quiet , romantic , yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot .
We were n't !
Enjoyed a very nice Caesar Salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheese .... both very tasty .
love the food .
All the money went into the interior decoration , none of it went to the chefs .
My wife and I always enjoy the young , not always well trained but nevertheless friendly , staff , all of whom have a story .
Fresh , mind blowing flavors .
Great pizza for lunch place .
No you 're going to go back because the food was good .
The lobster knuckles ( special of the day ) were ok , but pretty tasteless .
I 'm looking forward to going back soon and eventually trying most everything on the menu !
I have been going back again and again .
After reading the posts , I was always skeptical to go to The Minnow , despite living in Park Slope .
After the review I treked into Brooklyn .
Make more tables - perhaps a rooftop bar ?
the pad se ew chicken was delicious , however the pad thai was far too oily .
But they do n't have a toaster , which is strange .
Interesting selection , good wines , service fine , fun decor .
She then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables .
Top spot in town for Vietnamese classics , better than places that cost a lot more .
What is even better , is that the prices are very affordable as well , and the food is really good .
The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome , great appetizer to share !
I have never had anything like it !
Sit outside in the warm weather ; inside for cozy winter .
menu - uneventful , small .
Decor is minimalist and clean - nothing to distract or commend .
Suan is a great place that I often take my friends ( classmates ) too .
THE BEST PLACE TO BRING KIDS OR ANY FRIENDS WHO WANT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT .
For all of you new to Indian food , try the Paneer Roll , it is a piece of heaven .
The drinks are great , especially when made by Raymond .
I hate this .
The place is absolutely adorable and the food is delicious .
I was especially impressed during the bday party when the waitstaff went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly service to a 15 person party .
This is one of the best comfort food places in the city .
His wife Tanya , the hostess , completes the comforting atmosphere by being delightfully warm and gracious .
The service is fantastic .
Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet , where greasy , dry and tasteless are complimentary .
those rolls were big , but not good and sashimi was n't fresh .
Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .
I have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo ; you can tell it was a fresh lobster .
But too far east !
I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date .
Everything at Sala Thai is tasty and well-portioned .
The sides were ok and incredibly salty .
This place is worth going even if only for their beer .
... and that 's saying a lot .
I recommend that you try this hidden spot which will surely blowup very soon
The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great indian appetizers .
The waiters and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but were n't as dismayed or apologetic as I would have expected .
The sushi was awful !
THIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED .
I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others .
Not worth it .
The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well .
Chennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city .
please do n't fool us .
Be sure to try the seasonal , and always delicious , specials .
Have been several times and it never dissapoints .
Needless to say , I 'm never going back and you should be wary too .
From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff , I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it .
They 've the best desserts and mixed drinks as well as snack foods .
The food was bland oily .
The food was well prepared and the service impecable .
The service is awful .
head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st , taj mahal is also very comparable , in food quality , to the much overpraised ( and underdeserving ) baluchi 's .
so i thought why not change it up a bit .
Will comeback for sure , wish they have it here in LA . .
Great vibe , lots of people .
Too bad the food was n't of the same heritage .
Much more reasonably priced too !
Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place .
Something about them being busy with holiday party 's .
Why ?
Only wine and beer are served , but the house varities are actually quite good .
Last memorial day , I tried to make reservations but was told they were closed that weekend ( interesting , but ... ) .
We went to Ino for Valentines .
the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce ( even its low sodium ) , the vinegar-soaked rice , and the scallion on top of the fish .
We requested they re-slice the sushi , and it was returned to us in small cheese-like cubes .
But that was n't the icing on the cake : a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had .
Yes , it is good , but I 've had better for cheaper .
At this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the waitress WALKED away .
The absolute worst service I 've ever experienced and the food was below average ( when they actually gave people the meals they ordered ) .
Beef noodle soup is good as well .
moral stay away .
We were then shooed inside .
This diamond in the ruff is definitely worth my 10-minute walk from the 6 train .
My wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food .
I really did n't know what to expect for a restaurant that literally overlooks the main hall of Grand Central .
great food
The food is consistant and good but how it got name Best Diner In Manhattan is beyond me .
Delicious crab cakes too .
I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna .
How do you rate home ?
Located at the end of a magnificent block .
The only thing I could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my table .
The other night we had the $ 30 three course meal and everything was delicious - if I could of licked the plate clean I would of .
Everyone must come here at least once .
Aside from the Sea Urchin , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail , Boton Shrimp , Blue Fin Torro ( Fatty Tuna ) , Sea Eel , etc .
The atmosphere is n't the greatest , but I suppose that 's how they keep the prices down .
Yum , the chicken is great here .
There are so many other great places to go to eat and drink .... . this place is not worth it ...
The all you can eat deal is truly amazing here .
Stay away from this place .
Delivery service is great too .
Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything .
I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service .
But , they were too big for the bun .
Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood .
Slightly on the pricey side but worth it !
After really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner .
The large selection of bruschettas , paninis , tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating .
Overall , excellent restaurant !
A beautifully designed dreamy Egyptian restaurant that gets sceney at night .
My friends and I go once a week ( minimum , we live in the area ) and everytime ca n't resist walking out ready to burst .
We had a good time .
Our teenage kids love it , too .
Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon , Sea Bass and Crispy Duck .
Nevertheless , I finished my plate , and that 's when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom .
Although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great .
Not only is the food authentic , but the staff here are practically off-the-boat , they are young and hip and know what they are doing when it comes to food and wine .
after dining at B.O.G over twenty times now , its official !
No thanks !!!
For the price , you can not eat this well in Manhattan .
Went to Village last night for my birthday .
When we left at 8:00 PM , it was packed and noisy .
Have never had a problem with service save a missing rice once .
Quite frankly , this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried .
Not much of a selection of bottled beer either , we went with Brahma .
Terrible Waste of money . . scammers
It 's a small cute restaurant .
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible .
The best burger I have had in the Village .
A little crowded but they move that line really fast !
They are tasty , but I suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average American digestive system .
The whole experience was satisfying .
( 1 ) turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of Mott St. just south of bayard
And evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful .
The pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap , frozen , shredded cheese common to most pizzaria 's .
Not too crazy about their sake martini .
Wondering who had the best deals we noticed a line had formed to wait for this one particular establishment .
I loved this place !!
Ca n't wait wait for my next visit .
This is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together .
I am French and I really felt like home !!!
Great deal !
I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks !
And it was quick which is very important .
Highly recommended !
This is probably one of my new favorite places .
Coming from Boston this place is like Emma 's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge ( although they have more funky toppings ! )
Either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th .
The pizza is overpriced and soggy .
Baluchi 's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices .
Last time I went here , the waitress did n't come back after taking our order .
The space is traditional in feel .
Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .
I just do n't understand all the hype ...
This quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my Manhattan restaurant list .
Waitstaff are very friendly .
Who has room for Cheesesticks with the best pizza in NYC !
The food is just OKAY , and it 's almost not worth going unless you 're getting the pialla , which is the only dish that 's really good .
It 's somewhere you can eat and be happy .
We did n't get drink refills and she did n't even offer us the option of dessert .
Highly recommended .
We got a little tipsy from the sake but is n't that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about ?
OK , I 've been to Dumont a few times now .
the food was undercooked-the sauce watery , and the vegetables raw .
It 's a basic pizza joint , not much to look at , but the pizza is what I go for .
I am not a vegetarian but , almost all the dishes were great .
It is expensive but well worth the money .
Great atmoshere and worth every bit .
I ca n't believe people complain about no cheese sticks ?
If you are in search of the most authentic NYC deli experience look no further than the famous and historic Katz 's Deli down on the Lower East Side .
Thank You Emilio .
For dinner I had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan .
Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them .
I would recommend this place to anyone and would without a doubt come again .
The wine and cheese plate are plentiful and ca n't wait to try the fondue or table grilling .
Salads were fantastic .
Salads are a delicious way to begin the meal .
My chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin .
This is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the Basil slice .
The staff was extremely friendly and pleasant .
but the food was delicious .
but the service was a bit slow .
It 's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend .
They 're are better Taiwanese restaurants and they are located in Flushing , Queens .
Joya used to be a cool spot with decent food and a colorful - if not relaxed - atmosphere .
Lexicographers take note : a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn .
Reasonable prices .
But the staff was so horrible to us .
its just a fun place to go , not a five star restaraunt .
If it is n't for the food ( A + + + ) , it must be the service or the ambience .
P.S. Please do n't tell anyone in my family i eat there .
But the thing that my wife and I hated was it was so loud and it felt like ' bar ' or ' pub ' .
Always busy but fast moving .
I have enjoyed everything I have ever gotten and the fish is so fresh and always prepared in a great way .
Overall , this is a great new restaurant that has been consistently good every time I have been .
In fact , two people could really share one plate .
I was visiting New York City with a friend and we discovered this really warm and inviting restaurant .
My girlfiends and I ate at O.G. again last night .
To the owners ; good job guys , this place is a keeper !
When he 's not making authentic Neapolitan pizza in the open brick oven or lightly frying zucchini blossoms , he 's visiting the regulars ( a growing legion ) and checking on newcomers .
Servers are all different , Greg is my favorite .
Definitely something to come down and check out .
A plus was the good mix of people in their twenties that provided for great eye-candy while I was there .
Another review here claimed the pre-fix was $ 29/per person including sake but it is $ 55 per person not including sake .
There 's another girl who I ca n't describe , she is about 5 ' 6 " with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're * really * talking about .
This place is classy , chic , the service is warm and hospitable , and the food is outstanding .
Now it 's so crowded and loud you ca n't even talk to the person next to you .
What more could you want ?
Great place to grab a hot bagel on the way to work .
There was a heat problem to boot , so it was about 40 degrees in the restaurant -- we had to request to uncheck our coats !
I ordered the chu chu curry and my friend ordered the pad thai chicken .
This is the only Thai place I go too in NYC , it 's wonderful , and live relaxed Jazz on certain nights .
They honored reservation on Sunday afternoon very well .
Have a mojito and sit in the back patio .
Buon appetito !
This was a repeat visit and we 'll definitely be back again .
We do not need to go to a four-star restaurant anymore .
Everything is always cooked to perfection , the service is excellent , the decor cool and understated .
It costs $ 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll , but the roll more than triples in size , and that 's not just from the rice .
The veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly .
I have been going there since it opened and I ca n't get enough .
Red Dragon Roll - my favorite thing to eat , of any food group - hands down
If the weather is nice , try to snag an outside table .
And all of that wo n't break your bank !
My husband said he could 've eaten several more , the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had .
Do n't go .
What a ripoff !
Nice ambiance , nice little bar , good bartender , Francois , and good service .
I am bringing my whole family back next time .
10
Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you .
The service was excellent , the food was excellent , but the entire experience was very cool .
Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order .
I really loved the different and inovated touch that 's the cheff gives to the food .
Come on .
My wife and I recently visited the bistro for dinner and had a wonderful experience .
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience .
The service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing .
Pizza is terrific , as is homemade pasta .
Yes , they use fancy ingredients , but even fancy ingredients do n't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .
They are by far the BEST past in New York .
The help was extremely nice and did not rush us .
The ambience was nice , but service was n't so great .
The staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check .
Food-awesome .
This is a typical example of an establishment in which its owners do not know anything about the restaurant business !
Love YUKA .
Where Gabriela personaly greets you and recommends you what to eat .
Great food , good wine and an excellent host .
The wine list is interesting and has many good values .
I came to fresh expecting a great meal , and all I got was marginally so-so food served in a restaurant that was just so freezing we could n't enjoy eating .
I have NEVER been disappointed in the Red Eye .
$ 6 and there is much tasty food , all of it fresh and continually refilled .
Rao is a good restaurant , but it 's nothing special .
I got hair in my food 2 times of then !
When we inquired about ports - the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost .
I like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing .
This quiet dark asian bistro is well worth the trip .
Orsay , is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic French food in NYC .
The zucchini and mashed potatoes are a blend of garlic and butter which simply melts in your mouth .
For appetizers , I recommend the shrimp fritters and dumplings .
I almost wanted to write a bad review , so no one would ever go here and I could have all the dumplings to myself !
Also , if you do n't want to sit at a certain table , you do n't have to !
Recommended .
My husband said the portions were very small , but if my main course was good to eat the portion would 've been fine for me .
THe perfect spot .
Service has always been friendly and efficient .
I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere that whisks you away to the left bank of the river Seine .
Save room for the desserts ! ; - )
The bagels always warm , soft on the inside , crispy on the outside and enormous in size .
Also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ .
Instead of wasting your time here : SUPPORT RESTAURANTS THAT CARE ABOUT FOOD .
I am not the most experienced person when it comes to Thai food , but my friend who took me there is .
Try the tandoori salmon !
I 've had my fair share of modern Japanese and this spot delivers .
Even for two very hungry people there is plenty of food left to be taken home ( it reheats really well also ) .
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service .
I was speechless by the horrible food .
We got most of it back at home with us .
Three strikes and this restaurant is out .
Jimmy 's is hands down the hottest night spot in the Bronx .
I had the black cod with yuzu sauce , which was wonderful .
I found it on a cold night , the perfect spot to warm up .
i would just ask for no oil next time .
I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna .
Try the olive cream cheese or the lox spread on a whole wheat everything bagel .
they live up to the thai way of living .
Everything we had was pretty good , but we have only been there once .
Would not return for the amount we paid .
I look forward to eating here again
We live nearby BFC .
Sauce was watery and the food did n't have much flavor .
The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu , present your meal , and attend to your needs .
over .
For Park avenue I expected so much more .
Very good wine choices .
The best pad thai i 've ever had .
No food snobs allowed , this place is for people who appreciate good food .
The service was a bit slow and the portions are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush , this is not the place for you .
I love this place more and more everytime i go .
We ordered our appetizers , I ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon .
I can not imagine you not rushing out to eat there .
Just an odd group .
The staff is unbelievably friendly , and I dream about their Saag gosht ... so good .
This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time .
Dip the ingredients in with your chopsticks , swirl them around , and eat .
Fantastic place .
Not a very fancy place but very good Chinese style Indian food .
$ 160 for 2 filets , 2 sides , an appetizer and drinks .
Was surprisingly disappointed .
From the terrible service , to the bland food , not to mention the unaccommodating managers , the overall experience was horrible .
First went here to enjoy their garden terrace .
Had a late night dinner on a Saturday night .
Very neighborhoody , very quick and sufficient .
Would not recommend anyone to go .
My wife and I went to Water 's Edge for a romantic dinner .
The burger was great , also .
The bruscetta is a bit soggy , but the salads were fresh , included a nice mix of greens ( not iceberg ) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen .
Restaurants in manhattan should try to model food and service after this place .
Ive been here so many times the waiters know my name .
The best Chicken pad tai , I 've ever had .
I 've been several times and am totally smitten .
I highly recommend it for not just its superb cuisine , but also for its friendly owners and staff .
If the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items BBQ-ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not-so-fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .
Service here was great , food was fantastic .
Obv caviar is top of the line but the rest of the menu is so diverse it gives you a chance to taste so manydifferent varietys .
The bibimbap was average , but the stone bowl was n't even close to sizzling .
Food does n't appear to be cooked on premisis but there 's a high turnover so its pretty fresh .
the turkey burgers are scary !
I used to be a regular costumer at pongal until dosa hut opened right next door to it .
You wo n't be dissapointed .
The bruschetta and panini 's are so yummy !
Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant !
They brought glasses and the bottle , and just left the bottle at our table .
The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches .
The staff is very good .
The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful .
The blond wood decor is very soothing , the premium sake is excellent and the service is great .
This bar has it all - great drinks , cool atmosphere , excellent service and delicious food .
I almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded .
food was luke warm .
Just straight up cheap , good food .
Ambience is so cute and quaint , good for business although we were there on vacation .
Great bagels made the old-fashioned way .
The side dishes were passable , and I did get a refill upon request .
When we were finally seated our waitress came by twice-1 for our order and 2-for our check .
The two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place .
Mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a glass of wine ... but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff .
But trust me it is so worth it .
Alone for 100 bucks , it is really overprice .
No refills on fountain drinks , though .
( Besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city ) .
I felt as though I were eating in Paris .
Good Food
And the food , well the food will keep you coming back .
I did n't expect to like Nosh as much as I did , but the pastrami on challah sandwich I had was otherworldly , the soups are like Mom 's , and the knishes give Yonah Schimmel 's a run for its money .
all the food was excellent - considering the quality of food in most moderately priced restaurants is mediocre this was slightly more pricey and well worth it .
Just because P Diddy had a party at Butter does n't mean we should be automatically impressed .
If you 've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer .
The food at this place is ' gourmet ' Indian cuisine .
Cornelia Street looks like a Broadway set for West Side Story and the inside of Po is so cool quaint you really ca n't top the setting for a romantic dinner in NYC .
We visited Orsay during NY Restaurant Week and tried their $ 35 menu .
The food was great - sushi was good , but the cooked food amazed us .
The soup is pretty good too .
The restaurant has a Family feel , not least with regard to the portions which are enormous ; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine .
The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes .
It was delish and I did n't feel bad eating it .
we love th pink pony .
We will definitely go back .
The drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced .
This was the perfect quiet , relaxing , and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater .
Our visit their to say the least , was an unpleasant and costly experience !
The food was very good and I was pleasantly surprised to see so many vegan options .
I love going there !
So rude .
The sushi is average and the prices are anything but .
The combination of fresh tomato sauce , fresh mozz cheese , basil and the dough they make with imported flour , makes this is one of the better pizza 's in NY .
I wo n't go back unless someone else is footing the bill .
Read all the other review , they 'll confirm it .
We visit at least once a month .
i 've been back to nha trang literally a hundred times for the beef cubes - they 're that good .
Usually 3 vs. 4 items per dish .
The only positive was the wait staff , which was prompt , knowledgable , and likeable .
They have all been tonight and they have all been about the same restaurant .
If you venture off the island of Manhattan and ca n't seem to find a great Italian restaurant , drive to Corona .
Overall A oh ya even though there is waiting it is deff worth it
I found the food , service and value exceptional everytime I have been there .
I went to Amma after a friend recommended it .
But WARNING : to all those that use this site be weary , be very weary of recommendations .
Seriously , this place kicks ass .
I have known about this secret for the last 13 years , Emilio ( the Godfather ) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices .
Inexpensive , unassuming , great time !
Their bagels are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a ' special ' bagel experience .
Our waiter was fine , the place looks nice in that not-trying-too-hard way , but at those prices , a little more should be expected of your food .
The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner .
I 've been eating at Taj Mahal for over twenty years and have found them to be the most excellent of the Indian eateries on this block of Indian restaurants .
it 's the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food .
The food is wonderful , tasty and filling , and the service is professional and friendly .
This place is always packed .
The price very reasonable .
While I 'm not sure that this happens all the time-this is the kind of treatment that buys repeat business !
We liked it so much , that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York .
THE SERVICE IS AMAZING , i 've had different waiters and they were all nice , which is a rare thing in NYC .
Highly recommended to all !
One thing I liked about this place is that I never felt rushed or pressured to give up my table ot incoming guests .
And when I visit her I make it a point to eat at ' Ino at least once daily if not once for the whole trip .
Suan was a recommendation that I am glad we heeded .
Not only is the cuisine the best around , the service has always been attentive and charming .
Ambiance - relaxed and stylish .
My husband and I moved to Nolita 6 years ago and for as long as we have lived here , Peasant has been our favorite !
The place is beautiful !
the food was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining .
Calling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance , but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too .
We ate out in the back patio , which is worth it as it 's cool and the music is hear well there .
And I 've been to many NYC delis .
LLOOVVE THIS PLACE .
He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine .
The ground chickpea soup we sampled as a starter tasted somewhat thin .
Patsy 's Pizza = true love
Appetizers took nearly an hour .
If you are looking for a good quality , cheap eats - this is the place .
Be prepared to wait , because the place is pretty tiny .
Go to Volare for 1st class service and terrific food .
The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back .
Had 1 appetizer , 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the bill was ~ $ 55.00 , not including tip .
The lox is always fresh too .
Could have had better for 1/3 the price in Chinatown .
The food was good , the place was clean and affordable .
We all felt it was worth it .
The gnocchi literally melts in your mouth !
Waiting three hours before getting our entrees was a treat as well .
And $ 11 for a plate of bland guacamole ?
The takeout menu says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more italian dishes , I ca n't wait !
We will be back .
Just make sure my ice water is kept full and my tea kettle filled with piping hot tea and that 's all the service I need ...
All the appetizers and salads were fabulous , the steak was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious !!!
I definitely would n't go back .
Food is always fresh and hot - ready to eat !
noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST !
I think the restaurant was too loud ( when full ) to be romantic .
The portions are very large and the service is fantastic !!
The entire place and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt .
My wife I lived on the west side and found this while visiting firends on the UES .
I will be out with friends and all of a sudden I am hungry and I only crave one thing ... their Pizza .
Wo n't or Ca n't is not in the service directory .
A hearty two thumbs up !
This was , from start to finish , a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience .
My friends spoke so much about it for months , I finally made the time to come down ear and dine in .
This little place is wonderfully warm welcoming .
Good , fast service .
The wait staff is friendly , and the food has gotten better and better !
We ended up having to just leave because we were essentially being ignored by the wait staff -- even though the rest of the restaurant was largely empty .
A large is $ 20 , and toppings are about $ 3 each .
Service was quick .
Chance is a joke .
Thank You Emilio .
Ummm ... the beer was cold .
I will definetly be going back .
Bravissimo !!
I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night .
The Bagels have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture , both chewy yet not gummy .
Although somewhat loud , the noise was minimally intrusive .
If your looking for nasty high priced food with a dash of ghetto scenery cheap BX A$ $ this is the place to be !!
SUM IT : do n't read the ' 10 's ' reviews , try it to judge for yourself so you wo n't have as hi expectations , then you 'll be sure to enjoy it .
What an amazing meal and experience !
Again , the waitress was awesome .
This is the first time Citysearch did ' t call it right .
The sauces used are also not that exciting .
Alain Ducasse is the best of everything , I mean everything was excelent.I
Cool atmosphere but such a let down .
The mussles were the fishiest things I 've ever tasted , the seabass was bland , the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese , the penne w / chicken had bones in it ... It was disgusting .
The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you do n't like .
Whether it 's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar , you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite .
It was so bad I actually refused to pay for my food .
Finally !
just walk by the window and see all the unbiased positive reviews in all the major nyc publications .
Inside is a little cramped , but to be expected .
good place to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic french dish over a glass of wine .
A wonderful place !
It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects .
Do n't waste your time , or money !!
Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square .
The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well .
You fellas above says its the best Taiwanese restaurant in town .
The combination of super-fresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious .
My roommate and I LOVE this place .
The host ( owner ) and servers are personable and caring .
I had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the service was rude an unattentive .
The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach .
since the first time I came here I 've been hooked .
Immediately after we paid , the waiter took the money and said , okay , you guys are outta here .
However , the service is absolutely horrible .
Worse of all , $ 60 was erroneously added to our $ 80 bill .
The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions .
I have been here a few times for dinner , once for brunch and twice for lunch .
I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan .
If you 're looking for a great meal at a decent price , go to Del Frisco 's !
The signs , the specials menus , food , and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese .
I noted it was crossed off on the bill .
Prices are in line .
I 've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences .
Both the fresh mozzerella slices and the Plain Cheese slice are phenomenal .
It 's the kind of place I like to support !
Ess-A-Bagel ( either by Sty-town or midtown ) is by far the best bagel in NY .
short and sweet – seating is great : it 's romantic , cozy and private .
I have walked by this place for eons and finally went thanks to a girls ' night .
This place , which is only a few months old , is perhaps Queens ' biggest secret !
It only took about five or so minutes to get an empty table , but standing up was n't too bad .
Was n't going to share but I feel obligated ... while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing .
We were very impressed with the food and value .
The waitstaff were attentive , polite and helpful - an impressive feat in such close quarters .
We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great !
It 's a small cute restaurant .
The avocado salad is a personal fave .
The food they serve is not comforting , not appetizing and uncooked .
I can not recommend OG more highly if I tried - check it out for yourself .
While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine , our son 's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert .
Delicious , creative and fun .
The ambiance was fine , a little loud but still nice and romantic .
This place has totally weird decor , stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional ...
The dosas are skimpy , unattractive and drip with grease , and personally I 'd drink popcorn topping before I 'd eat another one of these .
The homage to India is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer , a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce , while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated , fresh take on sweet-and-sour .
More important , the sushi rivals the best in Tokyo .
The portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter .
We were less than impressed .
The only other steakhouse that seems to hold a candle to Roth 's is the Strip House .
one of the best Chicken Tikka Masala .
Also , the chick peas with shrimp ( appetizer ) is divine .
Food is great and inexpensive .
I really liked this place .
The fries are yummy .
Much more reasonably priced too !
The food is delicious .
I could n't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach .
I think I 've had some the best meals of my life at minnow .
Amazing !
they were dry and disgusting , i did n't even finish my first piece .
It 's all about the food !!
The food is yummy , especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries .
Inside is a little cramped , but to be expected .
Try the crunchy tuna , it is to die for .
The plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom ( third generation-Fornini ) pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle ( again making it soggy ) and nothingon the rest .
Definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date .
Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights .
A word to the wise : you ca n't dine here and disturb the maitre-D 's sense of " table turnover " , as whacked as it is , or else .
Save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one !
But they do .
Creative , consistent , fresh .
The exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations .
this without question is one of the worst hotdogs i have ever had .
Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon , Sea Bass and Crispy Duck .
( 2 ) egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of Mott street just south of Canal .
Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer .
You will not be missing anything .
The worst excuse for Japanese food I 've ever encountered .
Aside from the bearded , courdoroy blazer professor type with the NYU student he 's sleeping with that week , you see a strange mix of hipsters , frat boys , Will Smith types who need to be told they are black , bitter cougars who cant understand why they arent married yet ....
I was turned on to this restaurant by a fellow foodie friend of mine , and have been going back regularly ever since .
We had a good time .
Aside from the Sea Urchin , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail , Boton Shrimp , Blue Fin Torro ( Fatty Tuna ) , Sea Eel , etc .
We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night .
The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary .
service was efficient courteous .
Their exotic salad is basic ly a delcious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu .
Whether one pizza place is better than another is often very subjective .
Terrible , terrible management - deserves to be shut-down .
never swaying , never a bad meal , never bad service ...
for Meetball Night .
Went here on sat 1/26 and was disappointed .
Mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila .
Been there , done that , and New York , it 's not that big a deal .
Joe 's Pizza used to have the best slice until this pizzeria opened up .
A one women show !
Service and food is what any one would expect when spending that type of money .
Look I dont know if the people who wrote the reviews have ever been to a decent place ( PLEASE TRY SOMEOTHER PLACES ) .
My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better .
We ended the dinner with a surprisingly light and flaky apple tarte tatin .
What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka . . some of which we never received !
They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile !
in conclusion , THIS PLACE SUCKS !!!
With the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room .
Complimentary stuff kept coming , and when the waiter saw me opening a gift , I received my dessert on a plate that had Happy Birthday written on it , with a candlevery nice touch , and attentive staff .
At the end you 're left with a mild broth with noodles that you can slurp out of a cup .
All I can say is $ 2 pints during happy hour and the some of the cheapest oysters you 'll find in the city , though the quality is some of the best .
Innovations are just as assured , from the simple Carinthia cheese ravioli with wild mushrooms to the caviar-topped sturgeon , beautifully matched with a bright green spinach-vodka sauce .
Huge portions , great and attentive service , and pretty good prices .
Service is top notch .
Great wine , great food .
The food did take a few extra minutes to come , but the cute waiters ' jokes and friendliness made up for it .
The ingredients taste fresher , the crust is thinner and crispier , the slice is less oily , and it 's never burnt like it occasionally is at Joe 's .
By the time we were done , it was past 1:00 am .
The Pad Thai is excellent here , as well .
I am not a vegetarian but , almost all the dishes were great .
It 's simply the best meal in NYC .
Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all .
The space is a bit too small for live music , so on jazz nights , it can be loud and cramped .
The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out .
She gets 10 for her excellent service and advice .
Our server was very helpful and friendly .
Just moved to the neighborhood and we 've been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants .
Raymond the bartender rocks !
I am Indian , and I have tried many Indian places in NY .
The service was excellent - friendly and attentive .
Bring your date and a bottle of wine !
The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .
Pastrami or corned beef are juicy and piled high ( ask for extra rye bread ) .
However , service was as plain as sesame crusted Salmon I had .
This is one great place to eat pizza more out but not a good place for take-out pizza .
Here 's to the fake fish tanks too ...
We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town .
Perhaps this food is considered extreme to an Upper East Side resident , but for the rest of us who 've actually eaten ethnic food , this is simply dull .
I was pleasantly suprised .
Just want to warn you all - do n't waste your time and money .
Took my mom for Mother 's Day , and the maitre d' was pretty rude .
I 've been there a few times , and I usually end up sitting next to some pretty odd people .
The food arrived 20 minutes after I called , cold and soggy .
The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water .
Love Pizza 33 . .
I consider the best Grand Sichuan restaurant in NYC .
The quantity is also very good , you will come out satisfied .
It 's easy to get a table for a large group and you do n't get hustled out .
My fiance took me to Scopa last week for my birthday and I could n't believe the food .
The white bean brushetta to start was incredible and the pasta was phenomenal .
The lobster sandwich is $ 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price .
If you ’re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ’ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) .
The atmosphere is nothing special , but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo .
wont come back again for sure !
I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one .
We were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited .
It 's popular w/the late crowd .
The food was good , the service prompt , and the price very reasonable .
The filet mignon dish was superb !
All-time favorites include the Big Mac , Chicken McNuggets , Filet-O-Fish sandwich and McDonald 's famous french fries ; lighter options like entree-sized salads are also available .
We 've always gotten amazing service and we love the food .
My husband said he could 've eaten several more , the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had .
The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that .
Everything we had was good or ok .... but definitely nothing great .
The food is great , I love their dumplings , cold sesame noodles , chicken and shrimp dishs .
The food here was mediocre at best .
We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful .
My mouth starts to water merely thinking about the delight that is this restaurant .
The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared .
Super YUMMY Pizza !
This is the kind of place you 'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret .
The pastas were pretty good .
This is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates .
The service was very attentive and very generous .
Despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my go-to for modern Japanese food for the foreseeable future .
I recommend the garlic shrimp , okra ( bindi ) , and anything with lamb .
Try the green curry !!!
The food is great and reasonably priced .
When you want a piece of beef , head on over .
I had the Lamb special which was perfect .
Ive been here a bunch of times now and the service is always outstanding .
The food was exceptional .
Our friends have not arrived yet .
Wine list is extensive without being over-priced .
They even scoop it out nice ( for those on a diet ) not too much not to little .
But this place is a well-oiled machine so they know what they 're doing .
They treated us well and the food was extremely fresh and well-prepared .
This will be only the third online review I have ever made about a restaurant in my life .
We paid and left because we did n't feel like arguing any more .
Please if your thinking about it go , and stay the wait you wo n't be disappointed .
They are located in the middle of Chinatown !
As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited .
A quintessential slice of NYC pizza .
Even with John 's and Joe 's around the corner , this place will make a name for itself .
great food , lt 's of it , more then one person can eat !
We ordered a glass of wine and were finished eating and paying before the wine came .
I 'll be back for sure .
Very affordable and excellent ambient !
Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit .
I do n't get it either .
Pizza was a little soggy .
The food is great and authentic .
The pickles were great addition .
Good bagels and good cream cheese .
Great food and the prices are very reasonable .
Went there for a special celebration .
The food is all-around good , with the rolls usually excellent and the sushi/sashimi not quite on the same level .
Rao 's has the best service and atmosphere in NYC .
Food is usually very good , though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders .
Not a large place , but it 's cute and cozy .
The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious , if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini .
It had been awhile and I forgot just how delicious crepes can be .
The bartenders and the managers are really nice and the decor is very comfy and laid-back , all the while being trendy .
This place does n't get the publicity that Sylvias Soul Food restaurant does , but it should .
The menu is interesting and quite reasonably priced .
I guess the way my friends and I described it was The French Colonies .
Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you 're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant , very very good food , cheaply-priced , generally friendly staff , and if you 're a Manhattanite , or spend most of your time in Manhattan , Rice Avenue will make you feel at home ..... very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele ..... all on Roosevelt Avenue !
Just ignore the trendy wannabes .
I discovered Applebees when I went away to college in VA .
However , their popularity has yet to slow down , and I still find myself drawn to their ambiance and delectable reputation .
Went here last night - nice decor , good service , but the food was surprisingly excellent .
Food was decent , but not great .
There was no tap beer that evening , which was a disappointment .
We did have to wait at the bar for approx .
I had very high expectations for this place and made a reservation a couple of months in advance for a special occasion .
Our waitress was n't mean , but not especially warm or attentive either .
Several of the dim sum orders had about 6-8 pieces .
It 's like you are transported to the Italian countryside , very romantic and filled with antiques .
It is about FOOD and Ambiance , and imagine how dreadful it will be it we only had to listen to an idle engine .
In fact , this was not a Nicoise salad and was barely eatable .
As many other reviewers noticed , your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time .
The menu looked good , except for offering the Chilean Sea Bass , but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside .
great experience overall .
This restaurant is not worth the time , effort , or money to say the least .
This is some really good , inexpensive sushi .
The atmosphere was great .
The staff is 100 % Italian and the food is as authentic as it gets .
I have tried literally every restaurant on curry row .
You 'll see a lot of people eating there after church .
Decent wine at reasonable prices .
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included : ceviche mix ( special ) , crab dumplings , assorted sashimi , sushi and rolls , two types of sake , and the banana tempura .
Do n't be fooled by crowds of people .
Ask for Usha , the nicest bartender in manhattan .
After dinner I heard music playing and discovered that there is a lounge downstairs .
So , a little inconsistency there but either way , both pizzas were really good .
Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you , but the food does n't quite match up .
I 've been here twice now .
Highly recommended !
But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere , delightfully free of the BTs .
We visited Orsay during NY Restaurant Week and tried their $ 35 menu .
Although the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , food-quality and service overcompensate .
This is one of our all-time favorite .
Ca n't wait wait for my next visit .
Also , the sandwiches ( nearing $ 7 ) did n't come with anything like chips or a side .
expectations were real hi reading the ' 10 's ' .
The new menu has a few creative items , they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites ( but they raised the prices ) , the staff is friendly most of the time , but I must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words : No , ca n't , sorry ... , boy , they wo n't bend the rules for anyone .
I am going to the mid town location next .
The lobster sandwich is $ 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price .
Has the chef and owner changed ???
It is thick and slightly soggy .
Try the sea bass .
A fairly late entry into the haute barnyard sweepstakes , Flatbush Farm is n't in the same league as the Blue Hills or even the Farm on Adderlys of the world , but it 's pretty good , albeit with a somewhat dismal setting .
and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs .
I love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants makes the food fine cuisine , even with no idea how to use them .
I wish I COULD be refunded !
The food was delicious ( I had a halibut special , my husband had steak ) , and the service was top-notch .
then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi .
If you go , try the marinara/arrabiatta sauce , the mozzarella en Carozza is mmmmmmmm .... . everything is just delicious .
The food is delicious and the bar has a great vibe .
Based on the reviews for dinner , this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that , but definitely not for Dim Sum again .
My friend is 100 % right in the experience we had .
They smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone .
Kosher dills are the perfect compliment for your unforgetable sandwich and they give you plenty of them .
Although be warned their dinner menu to sit and take out prices are different .
Alias is warm and cozy and you do n't get that squished-in feeling you get at 71 Clinton .
For each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink .
I 'll keep this short .
So my husband made up an excuse so we can leave .
The main draw of this place is the price .
This restaurant used to be our regular Thursday night dinner location .
it helps if you know what to order .
Here you get the zen feel without feeling rigid .
I went to Ruby Foo 's after work with a group of 6 .
She was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about Indian food .
A touch more jalapeno heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed .
The ambience is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt service .
I always find myself sitting next to someone in the theatre industry - interesting to hear ideas hashed out while having a quick bite to eat .
A word to the wise - the Hoboken health inspector clued me to his findings that this is THE cleanest restaurant in town .
Delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door .
Also very inexpensive .
LLOOVVE THIS PLACE .
Just go to Yamato and order the Red Dragon Roll .
However , our $ 14 drinks were were horrible !
Great staff .
I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time .
I 'm partial to the Gnocchi .
They are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in Yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey .
The mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert ... definitely going to be back very soon .
There was a small group of us looking somewhere to eat kinda late on a weeknight and we ended up at Pastis .
I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date .
I am so coming back here again , as much as I can .
Best Taiwanese food in NY !
Overall , excellent restaurant !
Aside from the rushed service , we were very impressed with the food and the drinks .
The specials are usually quite good too .
We had the pot-stickers which were great and a tempura dish that was great .
Good luck getting a table .
being a fan of spicy ethnic foods , indian included , i made friends with this place long ago .
Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $ 10 .
I wish they would change back to what it was before .
Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat .
Mizu is the Japenese find in Grammercy .
Found service above average , but that could be because we were 13 of us .
The place does get crowded , so I recommend going between 4-5 PM .
Not only is the cuisine the best around , the service has always been attentive and charming .
Also , top the meal with a delicious and perfect slice of tiramisu .
The place is a BISTRO which means : simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere .
But $ 500 for a dinner for two that did n't include Wine ?
amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages PLEASE do yourself a favor and check this place out !!!!
Looking from the outside in , one would hesitate to enter this hole in the wall ( really , that 's what it is ) .
Go with the specials , and stay away from the salmon .
Big thumbs up !
The prices are about $ 9 for an entree for dinner and even less for lunch .
I do n't remember what we had ; nothing was memorable .
Service was devine , oysters where a sensual as they come , and the price ca n't be beat !!!
And it all comes at a very reasonable price ( congee , noodles , and rice dishes are no more than $ 3-6 each ) .
I loved this place !!
It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips .
I had the cod with paella ( spicy and very filling , I 'm a big eater and could only eat half ) while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips ( again , a big serving - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries ) .
We go on Mondays for the prix fixe and our experience with the food has been comparable to Blue Ribbon .
A bit breezy up there on the mezzanine from the wind coming from the tracks .
Plus they made a perfect martini .
It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects .
The service is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the food arrives .
I was looking for banana tempura for dessert and they dont have .
My chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily .
Service is top notch .
In fact , it appears he is going to go postal at any moment .
As far as the service goes , the waitresses were not particularly friendly , but they got the job done .
I would not recommend this place to anyone .
Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet .
Terrible experience .
Not a great place for family or general dining .
It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant , with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender , but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere .
The decor is night tho ... but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling ... its quite un-appetizing , and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern .
Skip this restaurant , it 's a big disappointment .
Go there once and oh yes ... you will go back ... you will ...
We could not catch our waiter 's eye , and he ignored us .
Metrazur has a beautiful spot overlooking the main terminal .
The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it .
My family and I ate here last night for our annual Christmas dinner with the family members who would rather spend the holidays with friends out-of-town .
Pick a bagel has the best bagels in the city .
I drop more dollar bills here than your uncle after a weekend at Scores .
If your visiting , you 'll enjoy the ambiance and the fact that it 's in Time Sq. . .
We all ordered different entrees so we could share .
And everytime I go there 's a bunch of drunk idiots making a scene out front .
The menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them .
At first i was rolling my ideas of yet another French place on the UES .
Yes , the prices are high , but I felt it was worth it .
It 's just average , just shredded , no seasoning on it .
Seating is ok even though sometimes there 's alot of people .
The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu , present your meal , and attend to your needs .
This is a great place to take out-of-towners , and perfect for watching the sunset .
Fine , I wont hang you for that .
If you do n't mind pre-sliced low quality fish , unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place .
A must try !
Interesting selection , good wines , service fine , fun decor .
Yes , the place is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while .
I work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time .
I had to wait for my friend at the bar for a few minutes
Is just the way it was in days gone by .
peppers , onions , relish , chilli , cheeses , you NAME it .
A Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner ?
Service is known for bending over backwards to make everyone happy .
I wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly , curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it .
The one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side .
Try the Pad Se-Ew or Chicken with Cashew Nuts for a memorable and repeatable experience .
The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal .
We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu .
They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies .
The staff is accomodating , the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed , and the food is out of this world !
To be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora .
We laughed when he finally offered us a dessert menu and we left a 10 percent tip , which was generous , I feel .
We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche .
We ate outside at Haru 's Sake bar because Haru 's restaurant next door was overflowing .
Food was okay , nothing great .
I have eaten at Saul , many times , the food is always consistently , outrageously good .
Yeah , sometimes the service can be slow .
the food is delicious and highly recommended .
The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts .
I have tried to make reservations , but both times , the hostess did n't have my name .
My fish was delicious in an incredible curry sauce .
Looking around , I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen .
We did n't even see a menu , as our waiter described both the specials and the main dishes .
When we stumbled on Leon , we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT , we were certainly wrong .
I lOVE THIS PLACE !
All of the apetizers are good and the Sangria is very good .
Good luck getting a table .
From the incredible food , to the warm atmosphere , to the friendly service , this downtown neighborhood spot does n't miss a beat .
The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese was n't even fully melted !
Have the iced tea .
Still , any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house ...
Skip Baroanda down the street ( Eurotrashy , snooty and expensive ) and check this place out !
Run do n't walk .
I know this is the case in many nyc eateries , but here , they really cram you in to the point where it 's borderline uncomfortable .
Ambiance - relaxed and stylish .
The service is descent even when this small place is packed .
Open late ( well as late as I ever got there and I 'm a night person )
My first experience at Siam Square was very pleasant .
Seriously , this is the best all you can eat in town - As everyone says , the Spicy Tuna hand rolls are the best - have 4 of these , and you 've broken even .
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested .
Try the crunchy tuna , it is to die for .
It was wonderful .
I 've eaten at many different Indian restaurants .
Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff .
The service was attentive .
The catch is that you are charged extra for ANYTHING that you leave on your plate so do n't be a greedy pig !
I would never recommend this place to anybody even for a casual dinner .
Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS !
Saul is pretty good , but definitely not great .
Pricey , but worth a try , at least once .
I will go back to Suan soon !
Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens , this is among the best .
I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors .
I could n't reccommend their Godmother pizza any higher .
You have to increase the service a lot .
You 're going to drop some coin , but completely worth it , especially if you are looking to impress someone .
If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you 'll love it here .
Their whitefish salad is excellent -- all whitefish with a little mayo .
Staffs are not that friendly , but the taste covers all .
This was a repeat visit and we 'll definitely be back again .
We could n't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and servants asking us to order and hinting that we 're taking too much time -- amazing , we just sat down .
Their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for .
whoever the jazz duo was , they were on POINT .
We were seated next to a couple whose kitchen was being renovated and we agreed since we 're all foodies who eat out a lot - that this was n't a place we 'd return to .
If you are someone who appreciates simplicity , elegance , and wonderfully presented and tasting seafood and vegetables regardless of portion size , Kai is your place .
BE CAREFUL before you request extra spice .
I never had anything I did n't like here .
You get what you pay for and with that logic in mind , Spice is a great place to grab some cheap eats and drinks in a beautiful setting .
And these are not small , wimpy fast food type burgers - these are real , full sized patties .
We 'll definitly be back again !
WE WERE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WITH OUR CHOICE .
The food is average : breakfast food , soups , salads , sandwiches , etc .
my wife and i have been going to nyc for years and would n't miss roxy , s food is expensive but it 's new york !
Authentic Taiwanese food that 's cheap ... what more could you ask for ?
The portion sizes here are huge , and the sushi is good .
My chicken was completely dried out and on the cold side and the sauce was not very flavorful .
It 's one of our favorite places to eat in NY .
Waiters tend to forget drinks completely , food portions are so tiny , two people have trouble sharing one entree .
Meanwhile , the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil , gratis .
Not impressed with the food .
I am bringing my whole family back next time .
The menu prices are a bit expensive for what you get in quality and portion size .
Our first time in New York and we had to try a New York Bagel .
The food and staff always surprise me with the new heights they are taken to .
The crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components .
I heartily recommend .
They kindly brought us more to see if it was better , but it was not !
Food was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly , but I can say this is one of the best I 've had .
Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon , which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave.
My friend had a burger and I had these wonderful blueberry pancakes .
We were disappointed with the pre-fixe menu of only 2 choices per course ( other restaurants offer 3 choices ) and ended up ordering a la carte .
It was not above ordinary and the beef version had cheap ( undercooked ) beef .
Prices are in line .
We left , never to return .
The food is okay and the prices here are mediocre .
Odd for Ave B , not just odd , The place attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least .
I 'm told that it is open 24hrs which is good .
While it 's not Nobu , it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full .
A cool bar with great food , and tons of excellent beer .
This place is incredibly tiny .
Anywhere else , the prices would be 3x as high !
One less manhattanite the better .
Yes , they 're a bit more expensive then typical , but then again , so is their food .
I had their eggs benedict for brunch , which were the worst in my entire life , I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was .
too large for just two people but nothing was left .
I did n't complain , I liked the atmosphere so much .
good music , great food , speedy service affordable prices .
My husband and I enjoy Sangria .
We were sorry to check them off our list as we had enjoyed and recommended the place in the past .
Only drawback - they wo n't toast your bagel , and they do n't make eggs for the bagel .
Being a vegan myself , I 've made a point of trying all the vegan restaurants in Manhattan -- and Zen Palate is easily my favorite .
Best Indian Chinese in the city , by far !
and i have been around the block , to say the very least .
I ate clams oreganta and spectacular salad with perfectly marinated cucumbers and tomatoes with lots of shrimp and basil .
I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends , and spent three enjoyable hours there .
I definitely will go back .
Once you become a regular , you are treated as one .
I was really disappointed ant wanted to tell everyone not to go eat or even take out food from there .
The service was excellent and the food was delicious .
Probably my worst dining experience in new york , and I 'm a former waiter so I know what I 'm talking about .
I 've been here twice now .
Highly impressed from the decor to the food to the hospitality to the great night I had !
We were treated with attitude ever since the moment we stepped into the restaurant !
After the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner .
It is nearly impossible to get a table , so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner , DO NOT pass it up .
I keep my fingers crossed the whole subway ride hoping that there will be a table I can sit at by myself and not have to share with the rice congee soup people .
Oh yeah ever on the west side try there sister resturant Arties Cafe .
Highly recommend this as great value for excellent sushi and service .
Took my mom for Mother 's Day , and the maitre d' was pretty rude .
Appetizer are excellent here ; you can make a great ( and inexpensive ) meal out of them .
It takes forever to get a drink and they almost always forget to bring something ( although they dont forget to charge you for it .
Place is open till late , no dress code .
The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices .
i 've noticed megadeth , mr. scruff , st. germain , traditional vietnamese songs , black sabbath , jay-z , and daft punk all being played .
This was a great surprise .
The food is also outstanding and is served quite quickly .
They had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice - RESULT - WE HAD LARGE CHUNKS OF BURNT RICE IN OUR SERVING BOWL .
I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine !
You want to have a real hot dog in Brooklyn ?
Our waiter was friendly and it is a shame that he didnt have a supportive staff to work with .
Based on the reviews on here , it appears that the restaurant is overwhelmed after the 7 PM .
The crust is thin , the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly .
If you 've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer .
I went for restaurant week .
We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order .
The only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting , the additional menu items are only written in Chinese .
I took my boyfriend for a dinner on saturday night .
The noodle and rices dishes taste great .
Great food , great prices , great service .
Dishes denoted as " Roy 's Classics " ( marked on the menu with asterisks ) are tried-and-true recipes , such as macadamia-crusted mahi mahi , or subtly sweet honey-mustard beef short ribs .
Been there , done that , and New York , it 's not that big a deal .
While the smoothies are a little big for me , the fresh juices are the best I have ever had !
A big disappointment , all around .
I have been going to this restaurant for years , in the past the service was average and the food inconsistant .
We had Pam 's special fried fish and it was amazing .
still stay away , the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were serves eventhough they were there much longer ...
great for a romantic evening , or a fun evening with friends ...
For the price , you can not eat this well in Manhattan .
I had been searching really hard for a restaurant in New York where I could really feel unwanted and ignored and I finally found it !
I was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter .
I was pleasently surprised at the taste .
This was on a Tuesday night .
So rude !!!
Went for Mom 's birthday brunch/lunch .
The $ 300 bill was a bit steep , but the experience was great .
We did n't know if we should order a drink or leave ?
The ambience was nice , but service was n't so great .
A million better places to go in the city .
They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another .
We did n't want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of Korbett it was just enough .
The food options rule .
This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn .
but ive heard a lot about this for the past 2 yrs and finally decided to eat here .
Reasonably priced with very fresh sushi .
The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine ( which cost less than the food ) , and made it seem like a big concession .
I pray it stays open forever .
Although I moved uptown I try to stop in as often as possible for the GREAT cheap food and to pay the friendly staff a visit .
Been to the one in Brooklyn for over 25 years , now I dont have to go over the bridge for the best pizza .... Hanx
For many people , this may not seem like Aunthentic Thai food because most places in NYC arent quite authentic .
The food is good , especially their more basic dishes , and the drinks are delicious .
It is sometimes a little cramped , and can get a little warm , but hello , it 's NYC !
We 've been to Grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed .
They have very quick service which is great when you do n't have much time .
The Steak Tartare is a great bet , they fix it for you at the table .
The waiters are very friendly and helpful and if you frequent they will remember you .
Did n't seem like any effort was made to the display and quality of the food .
The service is great , my soup always arrives nice and hot .
Yeah , it 's that good .
Food portion was SMALL and below average .
Unless you are eating in the Pizzeria side of this place , and are not in a rush , this place is a bad idea .
She lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy .
Actually , everyone who worked there seemed to be annoyed .
I complained to the waiter and then to the manager , but the intensity of rudeness from them just went up .
They do n't concern much of customer 's health , just want to make money .
The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate .
Chennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city .
I have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .
The place has a nice fit-out , some attractive furnishings and , from what I could tell , a reasonable wine list ( I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins )
A cheap eat for NYC , but not for dosa .
There is something about their atmosphere that makes me come back nearly every week .
Great spot , whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner .
Then , to top things off , she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend 's jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes .
Highly Highly Highly recommended !
The Pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down , it was a pleasurable experience .
I recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys fine cuisine at reasonable prices .
This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets , with that certain Parisian flair .
Warning : You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu !
not only does make the best pizza in NY , maybe anywhere .
We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order .
Slow service , but when you 're hanging around with groups of 10 or 20 , who really notices ?
If only they delivered , they 'd make a mint !
The menu is great , with a good selection , and everything that I have tried is absolutely delicious .
He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine .
Wonderful at holiday time .
I ca n't wait to go back .
A different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) .
Surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as Kobe .
Having hunted around for a quiet , romantic , yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot .
The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary .
Personally I like the margherita pizza better , but they are all good .
Prices are fair across the board for both food and bev .
If you 're in town , it 's worth searching for another place .
The Seafood Dynamite is also otherworldly .
Scalina Fedeli reminded me why service is so integral to fine dining .
the atmosphere is very nice , and a welcome escape from the rest of the SI mall .
But they 've done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials like the Godmother pizza ( a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil-brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual ) .
The prices are not terrible .
The vibe is very relaxed and cozy , service was great and the food was excellent !
We always enjoy the pizza .
keep up the good work .
Try the spicy wontons and the salt pepper shrimps .
Taxan delicious !
Check it out .
The food was well prepared and the service impecable .
The prices and ambience are especially great considering it 's in the West Village .
Went there for an office lunch .
This is the Cheers of New York , whether you 've ever been there or not .
do n't get me wrong - sushi was good , just not fantastic .
The service was a bit slow , but they were very friendly .
We were well attended to by the enthusiastic staff especially the manager Tony Gaskin who made excellent suggestions for our menu selections .
And even with it 's Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too !
The hot and sour soup was unbearably hot and tasted of only pepper and nothing else .
I must say it 's a little pricey for the food because it was not as spectacular as the view .
My husbands was perfect , my was well done and dry .
Too cold to enjoy .
The food is consistently wonderful - I 've been coming here for years , and the owner has always been accomodating and friendly .
All the staff is absolutely professional !!
This place is to be avoided .
for out-of-towners who will get a big thrill out of the location !
I 'll be back soon .
I 'll keep this short .
I have never been so disgusted by both food an service .
I think this a a wonderful place .
Would NEVER go back
I can not imagine better Indian food in all of the city .
It is definitely a good spot for snacks and chat .
Eating in , the atmosphere saves it , but at your desk , it 's a very disappointing experience .
I 've rarely had a problem with slow staff in the 10 years I 've been going .
It was good , but none of the flavors WOW .
Ca n't wait to go back .
The service was ok .
Get the tuna of gari .
The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service .
Half a chicken with a mountain of rice and beans for $ 6.25 .
We also ordered two hot dogs thinking they would be pretty good since there is a whole section on the menu devoted to them .
The service was attentive , yet unimposing , the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced .
The pasta was well cooked , did n't have enough sauce though or flavor .
Ciao Bella
Just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday .
Certainly not the best sushi in New York , however , it is always fresh , and the place is very clean , sterile .
There is no excuse for such lousy service !
Wretched and retching
Hip boutiques and bars on Ludlow add to the artsy , laid-back atmosphere at this Israeli-style takeout and eat-in burger joint .
I 'm just reading some of these reviews and its nonsense that people are reviewing some places because it was too loud .
The food is great and the prices are reasonable .
At first I was slightly skeptical because it was a sushi restaurant in the middle of NYC .
For those prices and the dressed up atmosphere you expect more and should get more .
Once you step into Cosette , you 're miraculously in a small , off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro .
I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri .
The manager then told us we could order from whatever menu we wanted but by that time we were so annoyed with the waiter and the resturant that we let and went some place else .
This restaurant is such a great place .
Highly recommended is the Spicy Fried Clam Rolls and Spider Rolls .
The beverages were excellent , and the dessert was good .
I never had an orange donut before so I gave it a shot .
( Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer !!!
The environment is romantic , but the food is horrible , the service is pathetic , and gabriella lies about everything she could .
Sandwiches , burgers and salads , like the lemon-dressed cobb , are classic successes .
Bay Terrace mall is nothing ( ok , almost nothing ) without it !
Taxan delicious !
I would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard .
Just do n't do it .
This is a fun restaurant to go to .
Beautiful experience .
We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday , and I was thoroughly impressed with the food .
Great food , great prices , great service .
they were able to squeeze me in at 6 after i called the night before my anniversary for a friday night reservation and told me they 'd treat us well for the occasion .
I 've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years : A new Jazz Bar , the most fantastic Dining Garden , the Best Thin Crust Pizzas , and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for ( these are not your average lasagnas ) !
The food was mediocre and the service was severely slow .
Unique apppetizers .
I had the Pad Thai and the noodles were sticky .
It does n't look appetizing as it 's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black , but the taste was phenomenal .
Had a great meal there this weekend before heading to the movies !
The quail was fantastic and unique and the pastas were full of flavor .
I would recommend Roxy 's for that , but not for their food .
Great for large groups and celebrations - our SUPER HAPPY waiter was the entertainment of the evening .
Our teenage kids love it , too .
I 've had the chicken with garlic sauce , chicken with black bean sauce , and hunan chicken .
With so many good restaurants on the UWS , I do n't need overpriced food , absurdly arrogant wait-staff who do n't recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy service , and management that does n't care .
All in all a wonderful experience , ca n't wait to come back .
Have the iced tea .
It 's just everything ... the food , the atmosphere ... the incrediby kind and gracious hostess .
Service here was great , food was fantastic .
I REALLY ENJOYED THE SHOWS PUT ON BY THE ACTORS .
On a recent Sunday afternoon , a friend and I accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT .
I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane .
Keep up the good work guys !
We had great desserts ( including the best cannoli I 've ever had ) and then they offered an after dinner drink , on the house .
To sum it up : Service varies from good to mediorce , depending on which waiter you get ; generally it is just average Ok .
And cheap !
The jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes .
To give you an idea of how good we thought it was , we ended up going to Ping 's three weekends in a row !!!
