Good , fast service .
I have to say that if this what makes it easier to get a saet a lunch - I dont mind .
We went to Ino for Valentines .
Definitely worth the trip to Battery Park City !
The service is excellent and always informative without an air .
The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese was n't even fully melted !
Not much of a selection of bottled beer either , we went with Brahma .
The only thing you can do here is walk in and eat . . but planning an event , especially a small , intimate one , forget about it .
I 've never been disappointed .
I can not imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant .
Wow over 100 beers to choose from .
It was $ 14 not really bad for a pound of Pastrami-but it did n't have much taste-I 've had better for less elsewhere !
I LOOOVE their eggplant pizza , as well as their pastas !
A cool bar with great food , and tons of excellent beer .
The website and rating makes this place look wonderful but in reality it was very disappointing .
A beautiful atmosphere , perfect for drinks and/or appetizers .
They need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the place is consistent .
I think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation .
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place .
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines .
otherwise , good stuff for late nite eats .
Try the rose roll ( not on menu ) .
Probably would not go again ...
The food is great and reasonably priced .
We recently decided to try this location , and to our delight , they have outdoor seating , perfect since I had my yorkie with me .
A big disappointment , all around .
Decent wine selection too .
Great roofdeck , nice group of 30 somethings , but no music , kind of quiet .
Very affordable and excellent ambient !
Maybe the secret was that we went on a Sunday night and everything was great .
I 'm told that it is open 24hrs which is good .
Bukhara is on my top 5 Indian places in NYC
It 's the perfect restaurant for NY life style , it got cool design , awsome drinks and food and lot 's of good looking people eating and hanging at the pink bar ...
They never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table .
But the thai is definitely not great -- bland and indistinguished .
This is the BEST Shabu-Shabu Restaurant in the Try-State Area .
Try the cheesecake !
The bread is top notch as well .
Being serious sushi lovers , we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action .
Pizza was a little soggy .
The palak paneer was standard , and I was not a fan of the malai kofta .
After we got our sashimi order , I could not believe how small the portions were !
As far as the service goes , the waitresses were not particularly friendly , but they got the job done .
Vanison was good but not amazing .
Definitely something to come down and check out .
When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not Mcdonald 's , every place makes things differently While it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude .
Also they were $ 15 each !
Despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my go-to for modern Japanese food for the foreseeable future .
Maybe I say so because it looked promising for people who like artery-clogging jewish deli food , but turns out to be poorly run and awful .
The portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter .
Inexpensive , unassuming , great time !
She gets 10 for her excellent service and advice .
The veal was incredible last night .
The staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check .
came here for restaurant week , did n't save much , but it was still great .
We had the pot-stickers which were great and a tempura dish that was great .
Perhaps the last reviewer ( who stated she was treated with attitude ) lives in a parallel universe because I have never had anything but a perfect experience at Yasuda .
The food is all shared so we get to order together and eat together .
Service not the friendliest to our " large party " !
They are located off the beaten path but are certainly worth the trip .
Our teenage kids love it , too .
Whatever the reason it is definitely the place to be .
If you 're lucky and there 's not a private party going on back there , you 'll get a chance to really chill out .
The waiters are sweet , the food is tasty and the bill is never too large .
I just read Mocaramel 's review and felt compelled to respond .
This is the first time Citysearch did ' t call it right .
With so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district , is truly an excellent find !
Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem !
This time , I prefer not to go into detail .
All in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side , but fresh .
I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend .
Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza ( as I love La Pizza Fresca ) .
The food at this place is ' gourmet ' Indian cuisine .
The vibe is very relaxed and cozy , service was great and the food was excellent !
mojitos and the service are the best part in there
AMAZING MY FAVORITE !!!
My wife and I also enjoyed the spinach , the Shanghai low mein , and other attractions .
Service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded .
The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome , great appetizer to share !
My husbands was perfect , my was well done and dry .
On the other hand , if you are not fooled easily , you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse , and food that will outshine in presentaion , taste , choice , quality and quantity .
I found the variety of the sashimi plate to be satisfying - fresh and yummy .
Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated , we were served dishes we had n't ordered three times , received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served ( and that order was undercooked ) , and charged $ 45 more than we should have been on our bill .
I went for restaurant week and ordered off the prix fixe menu
Service was devine , oysters where a sensual as they come , and the price ca n't be beat !!!
We left after one drink .
perfect for a quick meal .
Stuffing yourself with Japanese food is a rare thing .
If we were to move from the upper east side , we would genuinely miss this restaurant .
My personal favorite is Nick and Joe 's .
Check it out
I never had anything I did n't like here .
Bill a little high , but worth it .
And forget what you read under me , the atmosphere is n't that bad either .
and never strayed .
Here 's to the fake fish tanks too ...
For an untrendy rip-off - eat here .
I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of .
Great wine , great food .
However , I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once .
I think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation .
With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering , the food here was decent , not great .
It 's a steal !
I 've enjoyed 99 % of the dishes we 've ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional too-authentic-for-me dish ( I 'm a daring eater but not THAT daring ) .
I will have to say , this Bengali Fast Food joint is clearly my favorite .
Please try the Filet Mignon , its just the most tender piece ever .
It is LOUD , HOT and DARK .
so i thought why not change it up a bit .
I had their eggs benedict for brunch , which were the worst in my entire life , I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was .
Be sure to try the seasonal , and always delicious , specials .
It 's a nice place to relax and have conversation .
They even have a section in the menu called American Chinese food !
All pretty good .
The man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7 , then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving ( mean while there were boths open all around ) .
I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever .
Unfortunately , we chose this spot for lunch as we had done a lot of walking and ended up at the South St Seaport .
Yet paired with such rude service , would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there .
I have been to Roth 's twice and both times were very disappointing .
The atmosphere is attractive , but a little uncomfortable .
You are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but : Cassuolet , Steake Fritte , Tripe Stew , etc ; simple stuff .
This place has the best Indian food in New York , hands down .
An unpretentious spot in Park Slope , the sushi is consistently good , the service is pleasant , effective and unassuming .
The food is yummy , especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries .
I for one will never patronize them again .
Great , original taste .
Authentic Pakistani food .
To celebrate a birthday , three of us went to Mare anticipating great food .
Went here on sat 1/26 and was disappointed .
In fact there is only one I 've tried that even compares ( shabu Tatsu ) and even then I prefer Dokebi .
The only friendly staff member was the guy at the bar .
There is not a single place in Chinatown where you have a nice neighborhood feeling like here .
The food is fresh , delicious , and reasonably priced .
A cool bar with great food , and tons of excellent beer .
A great way to make some money is to buy a case of snapple from Costco and sell it right outside for only $ 2.50 .
I would recommend Roxy 's for that , but not for their food .
Service is friendly , prices are good - delivery time was a little slow , but for the way this pizza tastes , I 'm willing to overlook it .
The food is great .
Only drawback - they wo n't toast your bagel , and they do n't make eggs for the bagel .
The svc can be a bit rude at times , esp if you have big group , but overall the restaurant is a must !
We were charged full price .
Scalina Fedeli reminded me why service is so integral to fine dining .
My wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food .
The staff is arrogant , the prices are way high for Brooklyn .
Better than the bagel shop on the corner , but not worth going out of your way for , in my opinion .
This place , which is only a few months old , is perhaps Queens ' biggest secret !
Remind me of home .
The food arrived 20 minutes after I called , cold and soggy .
Pricey , but worth a try , at least once .
Veal Parmigana - Better than Patsy 's !
Best restaurant in Brooklyn
This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart 's and I must say how delicous the food and the service was .
also it 's great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable place , the service it 's just perfect ... they 're so frendly that we never want to live the place !
I went here in the afternoon with a friend .
The wine list is excellent .
The food was actually aweful .
My roommate and I LOVE this place .
Our waiter was fine , the place looks nice in that not-trying-too-hard way , but at those prices , a little more should be expected of your food .
One caveat : Some of the curried casseroles can be a trifle harsh .
and the owner is simply lovely and friendly .
The fish was really , really fresh .
its a little out of the way if you do n't live in the neighborhood , but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are .
Finally !
Service was very prompt but slightly rushed .
My boyfriend and I recently had an early dinner at Artisanal and was satisfied with our experience .
They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile !
They have an excellent selection ( the rolls with crab are really great ) .
On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch .
Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the thai food is excellent too .
The place does get crowded , so I recommend going between 4-5 PM .
My friend told me about this restaurant for a year before he finally took me this weekend .
All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends !
What 's the difference between the two ?
I do n't get it either .
The sandwiches are dry , tasteless and way overpriced .
The staff is incredibly helpful and attentive .
I like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing .
Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm , but the open kitchen is part of the charm .
The menu is interesting and quite reasonably priced .
We ordered a tuna melt - it came with out cheese which just made it a tuna sandwich .
His response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening .
THE SERVICE IS PERFECT TOO NOTHING WRONG IN THIS ITALIAN/FRENCH RESTAURANT
I found the food , service and value exceptional everytime I have been there .
I could have drank 4 glasses of water and still been parched - so watch out .
The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
Ambience is so cute and quaint , good for business although we were there on vacation .
A great choice at any cost and a great deal .
Great Indian food and the service is incredible .
The food is very good and the service is great .
one of the best Chicken Tikka Masala .
GO HERE .
I love this place !
The chicken and falafel platters were nondescript combinations with fresh leaf salad .
I came to this restaurant expecting to be surprised but left bored and overcharged .
The decor is dark , cool and soothing , while the food 's presentation is spectacular , considering the low prices .
Not only is the cuisine the best around , the service has always been attentive and charming .
Wonderful menu , warm inviting ambiance , great service the FOOD keeps me coming back !
The food is authentic Italian - delicious !
As BFC does n't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !
Paul , the maitre d' , was totally professional and always on top of things .
It 's somewhere you can eat and be happy .
This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets , with that certain Parisian flair .
The sushi is amazing !!!
And the staff is also young , energeic and hot !!!!
One of us actually liked the expresso - that 's it .
Though it 's been crowded most times I 've gone here , Bark always delivers on their food .
Great bagels , spreads and a good place to hang out in .
If you go here - your focus should be the Tamarind Margaritas .
The mussles were the fishiest things I 've ever tasted , the seabass was bland , the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese , the penne w / chicken had bones in it ... It was disgusting .
I am bringing my whole family back next time .
Wonderful at holiday time .
I really loved the different and inovated touch that 's the cheff gives to the food .
I would highly recommend this place !
However , in the summer of 2003 , it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup .
The problem is just that-it is a sometimes kind of affair .
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices .
Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $ 10 .
Lucky Strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat .
The music does get a little loud at times , but it just made me want to lean closer to my beautiful wife , and as I did , I got a whiff of corriander .
Outstanding Bagels , but you get what you pay for .
A must try !
Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm , but the open kitchen is part of the charm .
by dinner time , they turn it around and mount a huge comeback !!
My chicken was completely dried out and on the cold side and the sauce was not very flavorful .
Tiny dessert was $ 8.00 ... just plain overpriced for what it is .
None was made so i hung up .
The food was well prepared and the service impecable .
The atmosphere takes you to that place , the place many dream of .
The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals .
moral stay away .
And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience .
The place was real empty but that was because this was the first Sunday they ever opened .
Simple healthy unglamorous food cheap .
The rest of the menu is limited by everything is good eats .
Great burgers , grilled cheeses and french fries .
I am a 100 lb girl , had a glass of wine and a glass of beer prior to the dinner , and I was still HUNGRY after my visit to this place !
If celebrities make you sweat , then your in for a ride , but if your like most around these parts then you 'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype .
Old school meets New world .
The seating was if they were trying to get the maximum amount of people into the restaurant , so be nice to your neighbor when you dine here .
Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you 're with .
It took them 25 minutes to bring our appetizer .
The prices are wonderfully low .
For the price , you can not eat this well in Manhattan .
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian .
The sauce is excellent ( very fresh ) with dabs of real mozzarella .
It took them 15 minutes to put water in our glasses .
The food here was mediocre at best .
I 've eaten at many different Indian restaurants .
I had my eyes on this place , promising myself I will one day ' give it a try . '
After 2 tries by the waiter to take it away ( we had n't even looked at it yet , we had full beers yet to drink ) , the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations .
The signs , the specials menus , food , and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese .
The service was extremely fast and attentive ( thanks to the service button on your table ) but I barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order .
I got the $ 10 10-piece dim sum combo , every bite of which was great .
Nevertheless , I finished my plate , and that 's when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom .
They do cater to American palates , but if you like it hot let them know and they are more than willing to oblige !
Their bagels are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a ' special ' bagel experience .
Me and my girls will definitely go back .
We had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses !
Food was okay , nothing great .
Sweet Irish bartender is always happy and able to bring a smile to my friends a my face .
Leon is an East Village gem : casual but hip , with well prepared basic French bistro fare , good specials , a warm and lively atmosphere .
Service - friendly and attentive .
Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights .
The bread was stale , the salad was overpriced and empty .
All in all , I would return - as it was a beautiful restaurant - but I hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future .
The setting is casual and romantic .
There are numerous shavue restaurants in LA , but few out here .
Although , one night we went it was super cheesy , and another night it was less cheesy .
Ambience is so cute and quaint , good for business although we were there on vacation .
The sushi was awful !
Went to this place this place on a real cold night and needed a quick meal .
Try their chef 's specials -- they are to die for .
The restaurant was quiet and intimate .
The food was so-so .
There was a heat problem to boot , so it was about 40 degrees in the restaurant -- we had to request to uncheck our coats !
Great value for the quality ingredients .
Great sake !
This is the only Thai place I go too in NYC , it 's wonderful , and live relaxed Jazz on certain nights .
Service was good and food is wonderful .
they did give a 15 % discount at the end , was n't enough , as they knew the service was horrible .
They charge $ 6.00 for rice .
I would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard .
The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices .
The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic , just simple , small and sparse .
It was so bad I actually refused to pay for my food .
night without a reservation , we had to wait at the bar for a little while , but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience .
It just was n't Thai .
Fish was overdone .
This restaurant was way overhyped .
bottles of wine are cheap and good .
Our server checked on us maybe twice during the entire meal .
Quartino is my favoriate resturant in NYC .
SO SO SO SO SO good !
they bring service up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small dessert for our celebration .
So for a filling and healthy meal give it a go .
It 's the conversations that make this a fun place to be .
Try ordering from the regular menu , then you would not regret !
I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken .
The sushi is cut in blocks bigger than my cell phone .
I think the meatball parm is good .
Prices are higher to dine in and their chicken tikka marsala is quite good .
The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that .
The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner .
i do n't usually order wine with indian so i ca n't comment on their wine list or their wines .
Everything at Sala Thai is tasty and well-portioned .
Service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded .
While I 'm not sure that this happens all the time-this is the kind of treatment that buys repeat business !
LLOOVVE THIS PLACE .
The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual .
The sake ’s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world .
We live in New Jersey and whenever we go into New York City we buy bagels to eat hot and then to freeze ( they told me that if I call in the order , they 'd bring it out to the car so I would n't have to look for parking ) .
We have been to this place many times , and always have great food , wine , and service .
I was n't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes , but I guess that 's the price you pay for a popular place .
Perhaps it was an off night , but it was suprisingly average for a 9.3 rating .
I have no idea why this restaurant is so often overlooked .
My chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin .
Definite go if you 're used to good Indian restaurant food from abroad .
For being number 1 , this place has alot of work to do in order to truly earn its so called reputation .
The music is the best among all the Indian restaurants I have visited .
MY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended ... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly !
We arrived for dinner expecting to be impressed by a place that has an impressive past - but , that 's just it -- the PAST !
They do n't concern much of customer 's health , just want to make money .
Great bagels made the old-fashioned way .
The service is a quite slow , but friendly .
I absolutely love this place !!!
Big Wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach .
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you wo n't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME !!!!
The food -- though mostly deep-fried -- is simple and satisfying .
Since I cook for a living , I 'm very fussy about the food I eat in restaurants .
We always go there on the weekends and leave extremely full and satisfied .
We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday , and I was thoroughly impressed with the food .
They have homemade pastas of all kinds -- I recommend the gnocchi -- yum !
$ 6 and there is much tasty food , all of it fresh and continually refilled .
We got most of it back at home with us .
Great food , great prices , great service .
Wow .
One of the best hot dogs I have ever eaten .
A little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite .
The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had ( I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat ) .
The food is delicious .
Without the wait or attitude , I would probably go back , but there are just too many other restaurants in Brooklyn that are as good or better and do n't make me jump through hoops .
Sit outside in the warm weather ; inside for cozy winter .
The staff are attentive , and have smiles on their faces .
Their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for .
This place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city .
Straight-forward , no surprises , very decent Japanese food .
great food
And they have these home made potato chips at the bar that are the most delicious things in the world !
If this restaurant was in Manhattan , I would definitely go more often .
The bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the " free " appetizer of olives was disappointing .
All in all , the food was great ( except for the dessserts ) .
Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best , freshly baked bread !
Another great thing about Glechik-everything is very cheap !
Be careful , when they say spicy , they mean it !
Eat at your own risk .
Best Indian Chinese in the city , by far !
Most of the servers are very attentive , friendly and quite attractive .
Simply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible prices ...
Have a mojito and sit in the back patio .
What a hassle !
More Williamsburg Garbage
I am Indian , and I have tried many Indian places in NY .
I just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal for such little money .
I highly recommend this beautiful place .
Yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously , but it should n't .
My family ate here last weekend .
It was n't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it 's simply repulsive .
What a great place .
I was n't here for the pizza so I ca n't comment on that yet but what I had was very good .
Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll .
I started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two .
The bread is the soft paratha bread ( unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta ) , and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful .
Our waitress was sweet and accomodating , not overbearing .
but , the filet mignon was not very good at all cocktail hour includes free appetizers ( nice non-sushi selection ) .
It took about 2 1/2 hours to be served our 2 courses .
overpriced japanese food with mediocre service
To be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora .
and you ca n't beat the prices .
We have tried every Thai restaurant between Atlantic Avenue and 4th Streets , and Joya is the best .
Yeah , sometimes the service can be slow .
The absolute worst service I 've ever experienced and the food was below average ( when they actually gave people the meals they ordered ) .
They even scoop it out nice ( for those on a diet ) not too much not to little .
While it 's not Nobu , it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full .
i have eaten here a handful of times , for no reason besides sheer convenience .
Amma is nothing special .
How is this palce still open ?
We had a good time .
The menu looked good , except for offering the Chilean Sea Bass , but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside .
Tuk Tuk is my second favorite neighborhood Thai place ( the first being Joya ) .
Even my Indian friend could n't believe how good and tasty everything was .
Yamato is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi , or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much .
We did n't get drink refills and she did n't even offer us the option of dessert .
The only concern i have is with the slighly all-business waitstaff who order and throw the food down , rushing you out .
A fairly late entry into the haute barnyard sweepstakes , Flatbush Farm is n't in the same league as the Blue Hills or even the Farm on Adderlys of the world , but it 's pretty good , albeit with a somewhat dismal setting .
I do not think dinner in Manhattan should cost $ 400.00 where I am not swept off my feet .
All in all a wonderful experience , ca n't wait to come back .
I 'd call it an ' italian dinner ' .
The wait staff is pleasant , fun , and for the most part gorgeous ( in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way , not in that she 's - way-cuter-than-me-that-b @ # $ * way ) .
If you like the food and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants , this is not the place for you .
We been there and we really enjoy the food , was areally great food , and the service was really good .
The service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing .
Everything we had was good or ok .... but definitely nothing great .
I will not be coming here at 3am again .
The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty .
An oasis of refinement : Food , though somewhat uneven , often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef 's passion ( and kitchen 's precise execution ) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups .
Tell them Herky sent you and get a free confused look from the waiter .
The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches .
they were able to squeeze me in at 6 after i called the night before my anniversary for a friday night reservation and told me they 'd treat us well for the occasion .
Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order .
We recently decided to try this location , and to our delight , they have outdoor seating , perfect since I had my yorkie with me .
Oh and it 's too tiny for families with strollers .
This is such a lovely , peaceful place to eat outside .
That 's why you have to pay more for that .
This is the perfect date spot for Williamsburg couples .
Terrible , terrible management - deserves to be shut-down .
The manager then told us we could order from whatever menu we wanted but by that time we were so annoyed with the waiter and the resturant that we let and went some place else .
It 's true , you feel like your in a scene from Goodfellas .
My friends and I were on vacation in NY and was referred to Chance by a friend .
If it 's just a quick martini at the bar ( which I recommend Jeffery 's ) or a mind blowing Roast Chicken , go to Village !
There is no excuse for such lousy service !
Took my mom for Mother 's Day , and the maitre d' was pretty rude .
Not a large place , but it 's cute and cozy .
Spice is sleek , modern and cool with a menu that will not hurt your wallet .
Inside is a little cramped , but to be expected .
One of my Fav spots in the city .
I 've been to at Cafe Spice probably 5-8 times , it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square .
Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top .
this is still one of my most favorite restaurants in the area the food is inexpensive but very good ( kimono shrimp special was excellent ) and has a great atmosphere .
I 've had pizza both times and the caprese salad appetizer .
I had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz . of Maine Lobster in it .
A real dissapointment .
Plenty of choices to make your own creation .
Great find !!!
I have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo ; you can tell it was a fresh lobster .
The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great .
We did n't even see a menu , as our waiter described both the specials and the main dishes .
stick with the chicken , beef , and lamb dishes .
I did n't complain , I liked the atmosphere so much .
The service was attentive , yet unimposing , the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced .
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty . hmmm .
The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary .
Quite simply it 's like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tranquility .
If you are going for the food , it will not be worth it .
A friend from Seattle and I went on a Thursday night around 8:30 .
THE FOOD PORTIONS ARE REALLY LARGE .
They were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior .
While the staff at this little bistro is very friendly , I have never experienced more incompetency .
Great food , great decor , great service .
The service was attentive and her suggestions of menu items was right on the mark .
You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert .
Every course was better than the next .
first it took us a long time to find the place .
It was pleasantly uncrowded , the service was delightful , the garden adorable , the food ( from appetizers to entrees ) was delectable .
The view is spectacular , and the food is great .
The noise level was unbearable , conversation impossible .
One less manhattanite the better .
The food was excellent as well as service , however , I left The Four Seasons very dissappointed .
Complimentary stuff kept coming , and when the waiter saw me opening a gift , I received my dessert on a plate that had Happy Birthday written on it , with a candlevery nice touch , and attentive staff .
I have been twice to this restaurant .
Do n't go with a larger group than 4 !
Food was very good , but not what I would consider out of this world .
You will find yourself returning quite often .
The staff ignored my friends and I the entire time we were there .
The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions .
The food was authentic .
This quiet dark asian bistro is well worth the trip .
keep up the good work .
If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go .
Been to the one in Brooklyn for over 25 years , now I dont have to go over the bridge for the best pizza .... Hanx
The food here does a great service to the name ( Cantonese that is ... ) .
She lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy .
However , go for the ambience , and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world !
I am happy i did the food was awsome .
good music , great food , speedy service affordable prices .
$ 6 and there is much tasty food , all of it fresh and continually refilled .
Yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken .
I went with my fiance on a Tuesday evening .
We were treated with attitude ever since the moment we stepped into the restaurant !
The pizza is overpriced and soggy .
The food is spectacular , from the appitizers to the main course , and then of course the desserts , ( WOW ) you 'll need no more .
Kudos Haru
Anyways , if you 're in the neighborhood to eat good food , I would n't waste my time trying to find something , rather go across the street to Tamari .
Knowledge of the chef and the waitress are below average .
If only they delivered , they 'd make a mint !
The rest of the dim sum , though pricey by Chinatown standards , is worth it .
The food is flavorful , plentiful and reasonably priced .
Decor is nice though service can be spotty .
I have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .
While the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made Tiffin so attractive , the menu has been overhauled .
Everyone must come here at least once .
It 's no-fuss , fast and delicious .
If you ' re in New York , you do not want to miss this place .
It had been awhile and I forgot just how delicious crepes can be .
From the beginning , we were met by friendly staff memebers , and the convienent parking at Chelsea Piers made it easy for us to get to the boat .
good place to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic french dish over a glass of wine .
The tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .
It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips .
Until you realize that their five minutes is meaningless and your wait may be anywhere from two to twenty minutes it may be frustrating .
Do n't be put off by another reviewers extremely negative review .
From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff , I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it .
It 's one of our favorite places to eat in NY .
Ok , for all of us growing up in the Village of NYC , we have spoiled by a plethora of restaurants , most of which stay open very late .
The rice to fish ration was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice .
We were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited .
Has the warmth of a family local yet it is a great place to watch sporting events .
Taxan delicious !
Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town !
Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away .
Enjoyed a very nice Caesar Salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheese .... both very tasty .
We ate here in March , 2006 and ordered the pre-theatre 3-course dinner with wine flight .
This place is the most Japanese it can ever get .
The food is great ( big selection , reasonable prices ) and the drinks are really good .
I 've come here for casual lunches as well as for a friend 's birthday and I always enjoy myself .
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm .
Two people in our party felt like something else , and Volare immediately obliged with two great dishes that were not in their regular menu .
A large is $ 20 , and toppings are about $ 3 each .
It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects .
Somewhat pricey but what the heck .
The establishment scores big points in presentation and style .
I noted it was crossed off on the bill .
From the moment you walk in , you feel like you 're in the perfect place .
The food options rule .
In about 12 minutes , the thing is gone .
Arigato Gozimas Yuka !
The pickles were great addition .
The food , drinks and service are clearly among the best in the city .
Note that they do not serve beer , you must bring your own .
The plain slice is great and if you get toppings , the whole slice is topped with them , not sparsely sprinkled on like some places .
This place has the strangest menu and the restaurants tries too hard to make fancy food .
I thought I had died and gone to heaven .
Go to son cubano in edgewater nj instead .
While most people can attest to spending over $ 50 on drinks in New York bars and hardly feeling a thing , the drinks here are plentiful and unique .
The $ 72 Delmonico steak had to be sent back because it was not cooked to order .
The music which is sometimes a little too heavy for my taste .
I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one .
Their duck here is also absolutely delicious .
It ' only open for lunch but the food is so good !
This place is a great bargain .
wow ! how have i missed this one , tried Long Tan last week for the first time and now know what the NY TIMES and many more in the neighborhood already knew .
The portions are very large and the service is fantastic !!
Everyone I bring here always loves it .
We had a most unpleasant experience at this restaurant .
Enjoy !
Unbelievable .
The entree was also very good .
In the evening , this place attracted a well dressed , with it , NY crowd .
I have never in my life sent back food before , but I simply had to , and the waiter argued with me over this .
BEST spicy tuna roll , great asian salad .
The waiters were very professional , courteous and attentive .
Everything was going good until we got our meals .
This is the MOST wonderful restaurant in all of New York City , not just Brooklyn ...
Will comeback for sure , wish they have it here in LA . .
I could n't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table .
The noodle and rices dishes taste great .
This place is always very crowded and popular .
Their Margarita is best I 've had since I 've returned from Naples !
this is can became on e of the NY Italian Food fare institutions .
I stumbled upon this resteraunt on my way home from the subway .
Maybe tomorrow ; - )
For $ 600 ( the most we have ever paid ) not even waving a magic wand will ever get us back for a repeat performance .
Who said go when the place is quiet during the day ?
IT WAS OUR ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT AND WANTED AN AUTHENTIC ITALIAN MEAL .
Regardless of whether there are two people or two hundred people ahead of you the hostess will take your name and tell you Five minutes .
And amazingly cheap .
Faan 's got a great concept but a little rough on the delivery .
I was highly disappointed by their service and food .
Chinese Desserts are known for healthful benefits in addition to the sweetness .
Quick and friendly service .
We did n't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem .
This is definitely one of the places that I have continued to come back to over the years .
I suspect this restaurant is what Rao 's would be if it had n't turned exclusive .
Ca n't wait wait for my next visit .
Rao 's has the best service and atmosphere in NYC .
The staff is incredibly helpful and attentive .
I definitely will go back .
As we waited I watched 3 seperate groups of diners discuss how dissapointed they also were .
Great pizza and fantastic service .
They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends .
Best dish is nori-wrapped tuna .
The dishes are remarkably tasty and such a cozy and intimate place !
My wife and I will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them , as they tend to offer large portions .
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently .
it was a very warm experience .
Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat .
Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS !
The food is usually good but it certainly is n't a relaxing place to go .
I had the tuna tartare with sake , mushroom ravioli with pinot noir , and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $ 49 .
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible .
They might be all business at the counter when you give your order , but their food says I love you .
There is a downside if you 're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude .
I do n't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron 's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff ( more than the price ) .
Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES , I get angry that I did n't just go to Zucchero Pomodori .
Do n't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes , they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections .
( Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer !!!
We had Lava Cake ... we ordered when our food came it takes at least a 1/2 to make it .
I did n't complain , I liked the atmosphere so much .
The service was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the cod with pineapple tempura .
skip dessert .
I have eaten a lot of pizza here .
However , it is jus too good to not praise it .
I love Indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it .
I had been searching really hard for a restaurant in New York where I could really feel unwanted and ignored and I finally found it !
Bleecker St Pizza is the best !
We had Pam 's special fried fish and it was amazing .
If you go , try the marinara/arrabiatta sauce , the mozzarella en Carozza is mmmmmmmm .... . everything is just delicious .
Patsy 's Pizza = true love
Great for large groups and celebrations - our SUPER HAPPY waiter was the entertainment of the evening .
Brava La Pizza Fresca !
The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back .
I 'd definitely go back again .
It can be a little confusing as to where one goes to order , but once the food is ordered , you are in for a treat .
This bar has it all - great drinks , cool atmosphere , excellent service and delicious food .
Good food .
This place survives on reputation alone .
Very excited to hear that short-term Chef Jason Narone has moved on , he truly was a low point of their Sterling track record .
Both the fresh mozzerella slices and the Plain Cheese slice are phenomenal .
The Seafood Dynamite is also otherworldly .
i would recommend reservations on weekends though .
I would go back .
Service is not exactly five star , but thats not really a big deal .
The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful .
While their kitchen food is delicious , their Sushi is out of this world .
Seriously , this place kicks ass .
The service is good and the resturant is clean .
My suggestion is to eat family style because you 'll want to try the other dishes .
Try the Pad Thai , it 's fabulous and their prices are so cheap !
The service was attentive .
stick with the chicken , beef , and lamb dishes .
Definately check it out !!!
We went to Ino for Valentines .
Thanks Bloom 's for a lovely trip .
good variety but nothing surprising .
Sure enough , exactly 30 minutes later we got the call and were seated promptly .
Others have to go to other restaurants and feel sad until they 're eaten .
So eat fast and order a lot .
If you like Sakagura but you feel it 's too much , you 'd better try Yokocho .
amazing fresh dogs but best of all endless toppings !!!
The flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal .
I have been going there since it opened and I ca n't get enough .
Anyway , this is the last time I cross the williamsburg .
we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant , then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers .
really depends on your luck !
So some of the reviews here are accurate about the crowd and noise .
we came here on a crowded saturday night and were seated right away despite being 15 minutes late for our reservation .
$ 20 gets you unlimited sushi of a very high quality - I even took a friend here from Japan who said it was one of the best sushi places in the US that he has been to .
I was speechless by the horrible food .
I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time .
The ambience was so fun , and the prices were great , on top of the fact that the food was really tasty .
Be sure to try the seasonal , and always delicious , specials .
Not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring .
Over the years the host , Vittorio , and his crew , have always treated me as family -- although with all the business this not-so-little gem does , it amazing he 's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor .
And their prices are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and service !
The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine ( which cost less than the food ) , and made it seem like a big concession .
Great food , good size menu , great service and an unpretensious setting .
On the recommendation of a friend , I checked out Arezzo with my wife .
You 'll pay at least double at any other Italian restaurant in the city , and most still do n't compare .
If you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great food and excellent service , this is the place .
And as SOON as one person is done , she asked to pick up the plate immediately .
Best Indian Restaurant in the City
Dug the blue bar area too .
It took 100 years for Parisi to get around to making pizza ( at least I do n't think they ever made it before this year ) ... but it was worth the wait .
However , for what we spent , overall , it just was not up to par .
The service is fine and they allow you to enjoy the view .
Highly recommended ... As stated , I have n't dined * in * the restaurant but stopped by there to pick up takeout and it seems a very relaxing place ; also , the bar looks nice .
You must try the shrimp appetizers .
Do n't leave without trying One Night in Tokyo .
Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat .
it 's delicious !
So we sat at the bar , the bartender did n't seem like he wanted to be there .
The menu has so many fish items and oysters .
Thank You Emilio .
If you do n't mind pre-sliced low quality fish , unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place .
Poor service and management
Yes , the place is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while .
Stay with the roasted chickens and you 'll be fine .
I particularly love their yellowfun tuna and their mussel selection .
That place was awesome , , , sally !
We were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry .
The martinis are amazing and very fairly priced .
I ca n't wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic patio .
This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets , with that certain Parisian flair .
despite the untasteful previous review ...
Another great place to take out-of-towners !
Meat-phobes are in luck with the extraordinary veggie burger , made from a distinctive blend of chickpeas , carrots and other vegetables and spices .
I 've been several times and am totally smitten .
The fish is fresh but the variety of fish is nothing out of ordinary .
The vibe is very relaxed and cozy , service was great and the food was excellent !
Best of all is the warm vibe , the owner is super friendly and service is fast .
Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .
They all know you .
My friends spoke so much about it for months , I finally made the time to come down ear and dine in .
Yes , they use fancy ingredients , but even fancy ingredients do n't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .
THe perfect spot .
Decent wine at reasonable prices .
I went at 6:00 PM specifically for the pre-theater menu ( $ 19.95 for roasted tomato soup with chevre , steak frites , creme brulee ) and it was marvelous .
WE ENDED UP IN LITTLE ITALY IN LATE AFTERNOON .
menu - uneventful , small .
I LOVED THE SHOWS .
if you 're daring , try the balsamic vinegar over icecream , it 's wonderful !
After the main course came , we did n't see our waiter for at least 40 MINUTES !
Lunch came with pickels and slaw , no extra charge .
While this can hardly be called a restaurant , it is possibly the best deal in Manhatten : $ 4 for a plate heaped with rice and 2-3 entrees .
Waitstaff is great , very attentive .
Would n't recomend it for dinner !
I know this is the case in many nyc eateries , but here , they really cram you in to the point where it 's borderline uncomfortable .
We have been to Montparnasse many times and return often for good reason .
Bravissimo !!
The staff has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often .
There are a few Italian employees who may not speak the best English but for me that adds to the experience .
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money .
We visited Bread Bar during January restaurant week and were so pleased with the menu selections and service .
This was a great surprise .
And these are not small , wimpy fast food type burgers - these are real , full sized patties .
Bukhara Grill , the tagline says it all . . " INDIAN SPICE RAVE "
Volare virgins or weekly regulars , everyone gets treated the same and you ca n't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly .
I guess the way my friends and I described it was The French Colonies .
You can not go wrong with this place .
Good atmosphere , combination of all the hottest music dress code is relatively strict except on Fridays .
The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu , present your meal , and attend to your needs .
I recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great .
If you 've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer .
It was divine melts in your mouth .
during happy hour !
Look I dont know if the people who wrote the reviews have ever been to a decent place ( PLEASE TRY SOMEOTHER PLACES ) .
The food was bland oily .
The best Chicken pad tai , I 've ever had .
DO N'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHERS ON THE BLOCK WERE LIKE BUT WE WERE PLEASED WITH OUR CHOICE .
happy to be a regular at this place and would warmly recommend it to anyone .
Oh yes , and they lie on the phone , claiming they have seating in the garden , then of course the seats are not available .
we split a tasty vegetable samosa and the malai tikka wrap .
Go there once and oh yes ... you will go back ... you will ...
Perhaps .
Prices are very good .
The first time I went , and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere , I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad .
The staff has always been attentive and kind , and I 've always been amazed at how they 've handled all the various different group sizes that come in .
Everytime I go there I ca n't pick anything to eat and not because the menu is filled with great things to eat .
For those of you who do n't know , Uni is Sea Urchin in Japanese , which happens to be my favorite . )
Tasty Dog !
The parathas and kebabs are made when ordered ensuring a level of freshness that is unsurpassed .
Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table .
Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet , where greasy , dry and tasteless are complimentary .
David , Daytona Beach , FL
The takeout menu says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more italian dishes , I ca n't wait !
We got in line and were served while in line a bannan fritter .
The service varys from day to day - sometimes they 're very nice , and sometimes not .
Just an odd group .
I 'm not sure why these other reviewers are whining so much .
The staff is very attentive and we can almost always get a table .
Check out the secret back room .
My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary , and to our surprise it was fantastic .
Arigato Gozimas Yuka !
We replied that we would like to wait 5 more minutes if that was okay .
Nice Family owned traditional restaurant .
We started with lox and mussels ( the best ive ever had , ever ) and had the cod and trout for dinner .
But nonetheless -- great spot , great food .
I have never had cheescake like this .
I would recommend Roxy 's for that , but not for their food .
The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well .
We asked to be moved ( which took half an hour ) , and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back , even though the rest of the room was practically empty .
I 'm just reading some of these reviews and its nonsense that people are reviewing some places because it was too loud .
A few tips : skip the turnip cake , roast pork buns and egg custards .
Another plus is most of the entrees are approx .
Also , the chick peas with shrimp ( appetizer ) is divine .
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty ( could 've used a bit more salt ) .
The food is o.k. , but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant .
I will never visit this restaurant again .
Chicken teriyaki had tomato or pimentos on top ??
The lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it .
Go for it !
In fact , it appears he is going to go postal at any moment .
Finally , after all the raving I went to check it out with one of my enthusiastic friends this last Saturday night and let me tell you its all its cracked up to be .
Despite a slightly limited menu , everything prepared is done to perfection , ultra fresh and a work of food art .
After the review I treked into Brooklyn .
When the bill came , nothing was comped , so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine , but I did n't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it .
Do n't waste money on decor .
The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful .
you can actually get 2 salads worth if u take it home and add it to some lettuce !
Other than the crappy service from two individuals , it 's great .
I 'm glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in NY .
They showed up 15 minutes after the tuna melt .
Have never had a problem with service save a missing rice once .
They are served with a free appetizer and the portions are perfect for lunch .
I highly recommend it .
While the ambiance and atmosphere were great , the food and service could have been a lot better .
The pizza was great .
Great Atmosphere
Love Al Di La
Even my Indian friend could n't believe how good and tasty everything was .
The food was wonderful and imaginative .
Dessert was also to die for !
The menu prices are a bit expensive for what you get in quality and portion size .
Most of the booths allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like ' that ' couple .
There are so many other great places to go to eat and drink .... . this place is not worth it ...
I got the opportunity to dine at your establishment again a few weeks ago , I was in your upstrairs dining area .
We always have a delicious meal and always leave feeling satisfied .
What generous portions !
Great vibe , lots of people .
If you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo .
Try the spicy wontons and the salt pepper shrimps .
Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit .
There is something about their atmosphere that makes me come back nearly every week .
My bf and I go to the walk-up counter and order a pie .
Service was prompt , friendly and great .
So rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary !
Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else .
Yum , the chicken is great here .
enough said !
then she made a fuss about not being able to add 1 or 2 chairs on either end of the table for additional people .
It was divine melts in your mouth .
The flavors are very fresh and pretty inobtrusive , nothing flashy .
After dinner , take your date to the HUGE dance floor , probably one of the biggest you 'll see in NY .
One of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu in a positive way .
The aesthetics of this place are like an airport lounge .
The guac is fresh , yet lacking flavor , we like to add our fresh salsa into it .
Not because I was pregnant , but the food here is always delicious .
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly .
For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .
The rice to fish ration was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice .
LLOOVVE THIS PLACE .
We waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right .
Heartland Brewery is a great way to start or finish your day .
The staff is no nonsense .
The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese ( gets a little messy ) .
The halibut cheek appetizer came with a generous portion of foie gras , but that 's about the only positive thing I can say about the meal .
The food is outstanding and the service is quick , friendly and very professional .
I am not a vegetarian but , almost all the dishes were great .
Way too much money for such a terrible meal .
I was starving and the small portions were driving me crazy !
He always says , I do n't have customers .
While certain staples are excellent ( the burger , some of the pastas ) , the food is not really the point .
it was really good pizza .
Secondly , on this night the place was overwhelmed by upper east side ladies perfume .
But they do .
They have some great entrees here as well .
The waiters ALWAYS look angry and even ignore their high-tipping regulars .
Go here if you want fresh and tasty salads of any type you can imagine .
both are very reasonably priced ( around $ 8 for dinner and $ 5 for lunch ) , and are delicious and filling .
I have eaten at Saul , many times , the food is always consistently , outrageously good .
I thought I had died and gone to heaven .
Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store .
We called the other person who was very close by , and she told us to order for her , so we did .
Compared to other shabu restaurants around town , this places wins hands-down .
The only fallback on this restaurant is the prices .
My steak au poivre was one of the worst I 've had .
Service was decent , but not as smooth as I would expect from a place with these prices and reputation .
I 've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences .
I am amazed by the poor reviews - I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian - great prices , great atmosphere , good service and a wonderful wine list .
Its not curry in a slurry crap , and regular run of the mill food .
Try everything for that matter , it is all good .
I recommend the garlic shrimp , okra ( bindi ) , and anything with lamb .
The atmosphere is great !!!
No you 're going to go back because the food was good .
We know the difference between and oyster and bad fish .
I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks !
it 's good but , like the movie is never as good as the book , this is same analogy .
Never fails to please .
They came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant .
But $ 500 for a dinner for two that did n't include Wine ?
I sometimes see the waiters do n't have enough knowledge of their dishes .
The food was terrific and the service classy , attentive , without being overbearing .
You 'll see a lot of people eating there after church .
While this is a pretty place in that overly cute French way , the food was insultingly horrible .
The Pad thai , lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but , I 've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places .
Salads were fantastic .
The downstairs bar scene is very cool and chill ...
highly recommended .
While the menu is n't especially groundbreaking , everything I 've tried so far has been well-executed and tasty .
The food was very good , a great deal , and the place its self was great .
The food is good , especially their more basic dishes , and the drinks are delicious .
I 've never felt more unwelcome than last month at Jimmy 's Bronx Cafe .
at night , but it 's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the music playing in the background is also voluminous .
I really liked this place .
WE WERE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WITH OUR CHOICE .
Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order .
Try the tandoori salmon !
I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst .
I 've lived in NYC all my life and had never before seen so many waterbugs in one place ( except in a really bad dream ) .
I was turned on to this restaurant by a fellow foodie friend of mine , and have been going back regularly ever since .
I do n't live in NY but my best friend does .
I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time .
Service is average .
When we threatened to leave , we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing .
I will be back !
Overall a worthwhile experience .
The only downside ... they only take cash which is OK if you know about it ahead of time .
I had the salmon dish and while it was fine , for the price paid , I expected it to have some type of flavor .
We could not catch our waiter 's eye , and he ignored us .
The menu is Prix Fixe , so be prepared to spend at least $ 60 per person , but it is Well worth itsuperb food .
The food was absolutely amazing !!
Also , because it is so thin , it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling .
For authentic Thai food , look no further than Toons .
The rest of the dim sum , though pricey by Chinatown standards , is worth it .
Needless to say , I 'm never going back and you should be wary too .
Unhygienic
The atmosphere was nice but it was a little too dark .
The staff there is very attentive and down to earth .
Do n't be fooled by crowds of people .
The puke green walls leave a lot to be desired , but the food is very good .
The cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee !!
The food is very good too but for the most part , it 's just regular food , nothing special .
( $ 200 for 2 glasses of champagne , not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks ) .
Now we moved out of the state and every visit to NYC includes a stop here .
We were worried we would have trouble getting in , but somehow managed to have a short wait .
It is very overpriced and not very tasty .
Delicious crab cakes too .
For great chinese food nearby , you have Wu Liang Ye and Grand Sichuan just a block away .
Got club soda , filled with ice , no lime .
Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at ALL COST !
Anywhere else , the prices would be 3x as high !
We 've lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had dinner there .
Ciao Bella
No dress codes , no attitudes , plenty of comfort companionship , a great place to relax in an always busy Midtown .
On a monthly basis my friends and I get together and have a girls night out .
So rude !!!
Ok , so the servers wander around a little clueless , but there 's more than enough servers for the crowd they get -- it 's fine , you just have to make a small effort to get their attention .
The food is outstanding and the service is quick , friendly and very professional .
Told us to sit anywhere , and when we sat he said the table was reserved .
I have been here a few times for dinner , once for brunch and twice for lunch .
It 's cuz it 's so good you need to taste it !!!
Keep up the good work guys !
The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries I received from one of the food runners , which is not good considering the bill was nearly $ 100 .
hmmm .
They 're are better Taiwanese restaurants and they are located in Flushing , Queens .
Dessert - ca n't be missed , so save room !!!
Again , no apology , no is there anything else I can get you , no can I get you a drink to make up for it , nothing !!!!
they were dry and disgusting , i did n't even finish my first piece .
But that was n't the icing on the cake : a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had .
What 's the difference between the two ?
It first came well done , and I politely sent it back .
Prices are very good .
great food , lt 's of it , more then one person can eat !
I went with 5 friends and we lingered at the table for a bit and did n't feel rushed at all even though there was a wait .
Always great service !
This was n't the expected menu comprised only of pad thai and tom yum soup , but I thought that was what made the place so special .
Everyone raved about the atmosphere ( elegant rooms and absolutely incomparable views ) and the fabulous food !
Based on the reviews on here , it appears that the restaurant is overwhelmed after the 7 PM .
I live a block away and go to Patsy 's frequently .
It 's simply the best meal in NYC .
There 's another girl who I ca n't describe , she is about 5 ' 6 " with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're * really * talking about .
Yes , I ate the food , but I certainly would not have if I had seen the maggot before eating , and I was at this point fairly sick to my stomach .
Another review here claimed the pre-fix was $ 29/per person including sake but it is $ 55 per person not including sake .
When we arrived at 6:00 PM , the restaurant was practically empty .
The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance .
It 's all about the food !!
we have been there 3 times since last week we alked it by chance first day the manager offerd us the margherita pizza adn we said yes .
There are many Thai places in the city but so far Toons is # 1 .
In reality ( to maximize potential diners ) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby .
We 've lived in the area for more than 8 years .
We will be back .
Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza .
bottles of wine are cheap and good .
Simple comfort food and what hot and lage portions .
Everything about this place was wonderful .
I ate here for the first time and absolutely loved it !
Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant .
I 've been here 3 times for lunch and it is one of my favorites in the city .
I was there on sat .
The first time the sushi was outstanding , the second time it was a little bland .
The service was the only thing good about this restaurant .
Horrible .
Unfortunately , the food was NOT something to get worked up about .
If you live in new york city , you 'll find better food at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount .
I wish I lived there as I would eat at this place as often as possible !
This restaurant is a wonderful place to go many times and it is reasonably priced .
One of my favorite places in Manhattan .
I asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if I like Uni . (
I went to Ruby Foos for my birthday and enjoyed our experience there .
The food was absolutely horrible !
Bravo , Blue Hill !
but their mac cheese was YUMMY !
it 's delicious !
whoever the jazz duo was , they were on POINT .
I 've eaten at many different Indian restaurants .
Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll .
When you enter , you feel like you have entered your mom 's kitchen .
THE BEST PLACE TO BRING KIDS OR ANY FRIENDS WHO WANT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT .
The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal .
But now that it 's under new ownership and has been renovated , it looks great .
Got a date ? Go here !
I had the black cod with yuzu sauce , which was wonderful .
I 'm no food critic , but I 'd like to think I have a tiny bit of experience under my belt having lived in NY for the last 11 years .
The food is surprisingly good , and the decor is nice .
Try the hot dogs too , they 're snappy and delicious .
their dinner specials are fantastic .
The wine is always good , the tapas are always yummy , especially with the warm pita bread .
Great place , great value .
Great for groups , great for a date , great for early brunch or a nightcap .
Decor is nice and minimalist , food simple yet very well presented and cooked , and the wine list matches the food very well .
If you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde .
The table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long overdue bottle of wine finally arrived .
I 've read some of the previews reviews - people are either not New Yorkers or have more appreciation for ambience then food .
IT WAS HORRIBLE .
Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that .
This place is worth going even if only for their beer .
I love to visit Murrays for my bagel fix .
Yes , it is good , but I 've had better for cheaper .
We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and will be going back for the desserts ....
Sushi so fresh that it crunches in your mouth .
A great place to meet up for some food and drinks ...
Make sure you have the Spicy Scallop roll . . .
We were very pleasantly surprised .
Nha Trang , while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor , horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals , is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i 've ever been to . the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables .
I 'm not picky - but it was actually gross .
It was delicious and large !
This is one of the best comfort food places in the city .
The anti-pasta was excellent , especially the calamari , as were the filling pasta mains .
The food is great and the prices are reasonable .
They were such a rip-off ( $ 8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns ) and not worth trying .
I love the simplicity and respect which was given to the food , as well the staff was freindly and knowledgable .
Thank you everyone at Water 's Edge .
The restaurant is cute but not upscale .
A beef Consomme .
The best thing I tasted were the lambchops .
Food-awesome .
After that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it !!!!!!!!!!!!
I recomend the chicken milanese .
My vegetable risotto was burnt , and infused totally in a burnt flavor .
The service is ok , some of the people did n't get what they asked for .
Lucky Strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat .
Murray wo n't do it .
Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids .
The ambience was so fun , and the prices were great , on top of the fact that the food was really tasty .
I 've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years : A new Jazz Bar , the most fantastic Dining Garden , the Best Thin Crust Pizzas , and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for ( these are not your average lasagnas ) !
By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant .
Obviously the Chinese translation of this place does not mean Big Wong , it actually means Great Prosperity .
This is my favorite Italian restaurant in all of New York City .
Plus , on Wednesday nights the house wine is unlimited !
Little Tonino 's is just awesome , our favorite delivery place in Kennsington , honestly the best Gnochi I have ever had !
I/we will never go back to this place again .
For the price , you can not eat this well in Manhattan .
Authentic Korean food lovers should visit 32nd Street , of course .
At peak times , the restaurant is overcrowded and tables are uncomfortably close .
We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh .
it is a cozy place to go with a couple of friends .
My quesadilla tasted like it had been made by a three-year old with no sense of proportion or flavor .
Having discovered Ping 's on the internet , we entered with qualms but were instantly put to ease by the fish tanks that greet you as u walk in .
The food arrived 20 minutes after I called , cold and soggy .
Took my mom for Mother 's Day , and the maitre d' was pretty rude .
Do n't eat here unless you 're starving for thai food and you work next door .
THE BIG COMPLAINT : NO TOASTING AVAILABLE .
I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend .
The New York Times has reviewed this place three times already , you know it 's going to be good .
I just do not understand what the fuss is all about .
Delivery can be spot on or lacking depending on the weather and the day of the week .
Subtle food and service
Best Taiwanese food in NY !
even the wine by the glass was good .
My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better .
A little crowded but they move that line really fast !
( food was delivered by a busboy , not waiter ) We got no cheese offered for the pasta , our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal , when we would have easily spent another $ 20 on wine .
I really did n't know what to expect for a restaurant that literally overlooks the main hall of Grand Central .
We were disappointed with the pre-fixe menu of only 2 choices per course ( other restaurants offer 3 choices ) and ended up ordering a la carte .
I absolutely Loved this place .
We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche .
The sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the rasamalai was forgettable .
When you 're sitting in their main dining room ( which has a spectacular , hand-painted high ceiling ) you 'd never know there was a world outside .
This little place is wonderfully warm welcoming .
We were worried we would have trouble getting in , but somehow managed to have a short wait .
Each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface , and you get platters of thin sliced meats , various vegetables , and rice and glass noodles .
Succulent steaks cooked precisely to your desired ' doneness ' accompanied by salads and sides that do n't look like leafy road kill .
He ca n't help , they 're bought up so fast .
Hats off to the chef .
Deep Fried Skewers are good and still rare to find in NYC .
Make sure you try this place as often as you can .
The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach .
$ 20 for all you can eat sushi can not be beaten .
We have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and service is given .
The prices are not terrible .
You order from a menu , so you leave feeling like you missed the full experience .
Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon , which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave.
I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said , " can I help you " and " how many are in your party . "
Have recommended the place to friends , always gets good response .
While the food was good ( certainly no Il Mulino ) the service was horrendous .
I never write on these sites but this restaurant is def worth commending !
peppers , onions , relish , chilli , cheeses , you NAME it .
Some servers make you feel like they are doing you a favor to bring you the food .
You could get a much better dining experience for the same amount of money in a lot of other French Bistros .
Service was among the best I have ever had in NYC .
All I can say is $ 2 pints during happy hour and the some of the cheapest oysters you 'll find in the city , though the quality is some of the best .
good selection of wines ranging from affordable to high end .
I ordered from here last week .
The help was extremely nice and did not rush us .
I 'm amazed we have n't been kicked out of this place yet .
I would never wait for a table to eat , it just is not THAT great .
And everytime I go there 's a bunch of drunk idiots making a scene out front .
For a Fabulous Wedding !
When you 're sitting in their main dining room ( which has a spectacular , hand-painted high ceiling ) you 'd never know there was a world outside .
great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer .
The restaurant could use a little paint , but all in all a great sushi place !
I 've been to at Cafe Spice probably 5-8 times , it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square .
We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there , sharing a large Pelligrino , a pizza of two of their specials , one was goat cheese the other blue cheese , and both were excellent .
uni from maine vs california , sea vs freshwater eel ) to get a good taste comparison .
The food is excellent !
Romantic if you want it to be ( brightly lit ) .
I would recommend to ask for a bigger sitting area when you make a reservation ( if possible )
Waiting three hours before getting our entrees was a treat as well .
She was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about Indian food .
Would definitely visit again .
Butter was melted , white wine warm , cheese oozing everywhere .
I used to be a regular costumer at pongal until dosa hut opened right next door to it .
My boyfriend and I went here last night and LOVED it !
My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge !
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta ( raddichio was kind of bitter though ) .
It 's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early .
believe us , we 've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs .
This is one great place to eat pizza more out but not a good place for take-out pizza .
Food is excellent .
So much more than the usual bar food , go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their hand-crafted beers .
I went here for a family birthday dinner .
I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled .
and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs .
Raga stands out with an interesting fusion of French and Indian cooking .
The lamb was tender so full of flavor , the dessert was divine !!
This place does n't compare with Mamoun 's in terms of price , freshness , value , and consisent quality , but that 's just my opinion .
A one women show !
I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee ( rice porridge ) .
They have very quick service which is great when you do n't have much time .
The service is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the food arrives .
Ciao Bella
Had dinner here on a Friday and the food was great .
From beginning appetizers , the scallops were incredible , to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sorbet , we were delighted by the taste sensations .
Hip boutiques and bars on Ludlow add to the artsy , laid-back atmosphere at this Israeli-style takeout and eat-in burger joint .
Go inside and you wo n't want to leave .
The wine list is interesting and has many good values .
We all ordered different entrees so we could share .
The food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare , the dishes are never a disappointment .
But that was n't the icing on the cake : a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had .
There is a downside if you 're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude .
I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service .
My girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .
I have been to spice three times - twice during lunch and once at dinner .
To be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora .
Even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine , if you can call $ 70.00 inexpensive , the cost is through the roof for better than average fare .
Sometimes you pay a lot and do n't get much in return - it 's manhattan , things are expensive .
We had a birthday party here recently and the food and service was amazing .
Even with the prix fixe pricing , this restaurant is not worth it .
The food is above average for midtown and sligtly better than some of the other Heartland Breweries in the city .
The bagel was huge .
Even when the chef is not in the house , the food and service are right on target .
I usually go there later at night when I get off work so I do n't have to deal with crowds or lines .
The food was ok and fair nothing to go crazy .
While the prices are nothing special , the portions are huge .
Save your money and do n't waste your calories , go to Margharita 's on Washington Street instead , they have amazing food and the BEST service .
Excellent dumplings served amid clean , chic decor .
Never in my life did I think that I could be satisfied both in taste and in quantity for $ 3.00 in NYC .
Go with a group of friends and you will have a great time .
And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic .
Most importantly , it is reasonably priced .
You feel like you made it to New York when you eat here .
Have frequented ' ino for several years and the food remains excellent .
My friend ordered some of their special sushi rolls which had excellent presentation and tasted great !
Sure , everyone 's got their favorite , but to know Sal , is to know New York .
My chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily .
We ran a little late for the reservation but it was n't a problem to get our table immediately .
If the weather is nice , try to snag an outside table .
Service was very good - prompt , attentive and non-intrusive .
We had a wonderful meal at Naples 45 a month ago on a visit to NYC .
my first time here was with my gf for our 12 month anniversary .
The tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .
Always good drinks and service is pretty good ;
Went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and appetizers .
The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing !
It is nearly impossible to get a table , so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner , DO NOT pass it up .
The pizza is the best if you like thin crusted pizza .
What came to our table was burned beyond recognition and stringy .
The service is ok but could be better .
The Singapore Mai Fun had NO curry flavor whatsoever .
Great deal !
I like the ambience , it 's very dark and original .
Although the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , food-quality and service overcompensate .
After dealing with subpar pizza all over the Kensington neighborhood - I 've found little toninos .
Avoid at all costs .
Decor is nice though service can be spotty .
brick oven gallery is My pick for best pizza restaurant anywhere .
It 's cute and simple and I loved it .
When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets , and then ordered for them .
What more can you ask for ?
I have been in NYC for over 10 years and could not find this delicacy east of the Hudson .
Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza .
Decent Thai food in cute - though a bit dank - little Nolita hangout , BUT service terrible .
If you want some roast duck , pork or chicken on rice with ginger , try them out !
We love the food , drinks , and atmosphere !
The wine and cheese plate are plentiful and ca n't wait to try the fondue or table grilling .
this is the best secret place in midtown ' , I heard that from the bartender , after having brilliant food ( try steak with portobello mushrooms ) and drinks on the bar last Tuesday .
The food is delicious and the bar has a great vibe .
If you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained , this is a great place to go and eat .
We will go back every time we are in the City .
Try it side by side and there 's no comparison .
Try the Pad Thai , it 's fabulous and their prices are so cheap !
Would recommend - perfect for those looking for a place close to grand central .
The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand .
The blond wood decor is very soothing , the premium sake is excellent and the service is great .
I was n't impressed and it was n't SPICEY ????
My girlfriend convinced me to go in the other night for a quick bite .
And it all comes at a very reasonable price ( congee , noodles , and rice dishes are no more than $ 3-6 each ) .
The sake menu should not be overlooked !
This place is worth an one-hour drive .
It 's always quiet because it 's awful .
We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful .
Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh , a delicious and sweet tasting bread .
Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza ( as I love La Pizza Fresca ) .
When my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .
I have never eaten in the restaurant , however , upon reading the reviews I got take out last week .
Another friend had to ask 3 times for parmesan cheese .
The pastas were pretty good .
While it was large and a bit noisy , the drinks were fantastic , and the food was superb .
The food is great , service is ok .
Each time we 've been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return .
Their wines by the glass are a great accompaniment and you can eat like a king with wine for under $ 30 .
The food was below average , the service was pathetic , there was no ambience at all .
If you venture off the island of Manhattan and ca n't seem to find a great Italian restaurant , drive to Corona .
The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews .
It was delish and I did n't feel bad eating it .
I always get the Shabu-Shabu dinner and the beef is always fresh .
Among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants , this offers by far one of the best values for your money .
Went to Village last night for my birthday .
This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant , the food .
Really , I find it rather scandalous that such a crappy restaurant attracts such crowds -- this , in the city of a million restaurants , at least 9/10 of which are way better than this one .
I had Filet Mignon with garlic mash .
We were n't even at our table for more than an hour total .
My girlfiends and I ate at O.G. again last night .
So my husband made up an excuse so we can leave .
The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees .
The service was quick and friendly .
Get the tuna of gari .
It 's all about the food !!
The service we experienced was friendly and good .
We loved it and will go back !
The best part of the experience was knowing that the manager ( a bubbly , friendly young woman with a great smile ) truly cared about how we were doing .
It is so easy to get a reservation at a top place in NYC with a week 's notice .
I ca n't wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic patio .
The place was quiet and delightful .
Was n't going to share but I feel obligated ... while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing .
It 's one of our favorite places to eat in NY .
The chocolate raspberry cake is heavenly - not too sweet , but full of flavor .
The service was outstanding .
As a student in NYU i need a place to eat after a hard day of work so usually i just go to any indian restraunt near by .
But the meals were terrible .
It 's like you are transported to the Italian countryside , very romantic and filled with antiques .
While we thoroughly enjoyed the food , it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation .
This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money .
While the ambiance and atmosphere were great , the food and service could have been a lot better .
Wish NY had more of these kind of places : intimate , superb food , homey , top notch all the way around , certainly worth the wait .
The bagels are fabulous .
The sushi is always fresh and yummy and the menu is pretty varied .
I can not recommend OG more highly if I tried - check it out for yourself .
We laughed when he finally offered us a dessert menu and we left a 10 percent tip , which was generous , I feel .
IT IS DEFINITELY SPECIAL AND AFFORDABLE .
Besides , when you have bad service , that 's less money you have to tip .
Edible but really a ripoff at those prices given whats in the area .
Creative dishes like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette and fettuccine with grilled seafood in a rosemary-orange sauce are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable bistro menu .
I read the other review and have to say I had the opposite experience here last Sunday .
The food was definitely good , but when all was said and done , I just could n't justify it for the price ( including 2 drinks , $ 100/person ) ...
Moderate prices .
Everything was wonderful ; food , drinks , staff , mileau .
In Short The Black Sheep distinguishes itself from the Midtown pub herd with a look that 's a mix of sports-bar butch and ornate kitsch .
As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited .
The seafood is amazing , there 's a good wine list , and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises .
This place must have cost the owners afortune to build .
The sangria 's - watered down .
I complained to the waiter and then to the manager , but the intensity of rudeness from them just went up .
Being from the south , there are n't any good delis in my area and while watching Foods across America on PBS I found out about Katz 's Deli .
Food is excellent .
The host ( owner ) and servers are personable and caring .
My father had the flank steak which was very good , and my mother had the swordfish .
Place should also have a 1,2,3 chili rating to be more authentic ...
What more could you want ?
i actually feel like i should keep it a secret .
The food is amazing , rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza .
After really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner .
One should not go to Lucky Strike for the food .
Normally that would be improper , however they were all delicious and my host did not complain .
This should have been done in a back room - away from customers .
Emilio , the owner , is often sitting in the front table greeting guests as they come and go .
however , it 's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .
Menus feature seasonal picks , like sweet corn-foie gras brulee .
The side dishes were passable , and I did get a refill upon request .
I recommend the jelly fish , drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings , certainly the stir fry blue crab .
Save your money and your time and go somewhere else .
I 'm sure I 'll return for a final judgement tho .
There are other people waiting !
But after last night , Spice Grill is the only place I 'm eating indian cuisine .
I will be going back very soon .
Love this place , every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go .
We will be back .
It is simply amazing .
And when I visit her I make it a point to eat at ' Ino at least once daily if not once for the whole trip .
I never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it .
If we were to move from the upper east side , we would genuinely miss this restaurant .
If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this place .
Overpriced and not tasty
This place has the best sushi in the city .
Not cheap but very yummy .
I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever .
It 's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend .
So , for good food i 'd recommend it , but not for a fun night out .
The appetizers are just OK and the main courses were decidedly subpar .
We got a little tipsy from the sake but is n't that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about ?
The ingredients taste fresher , the crust is thinner and crispier , the slice is less oily , and it 's never burnt like it occasionally is at Joe 's .
then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi .
All in all , I do n't see how you can go wrong .
I 've been coming here regularly since it opened , about 2 years ago .
Both a number of the appetizer and pasta specials were amazing .
It 's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone .
The Sashimi portion are big enough to appease most people , but I did n't like the fact they used artifical lobster meat .
The service is awful -- the last time I was there ( and I do mean the last time ) we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave .
Give it a try and enjoy .
Once you become a regular , you are treated as one .
I know because I live nearby .
I had the Pad Thai and the noodles were sticky .
I was wrong .
I 'm saving up for my next visit .
In summer-eat outside on a terrace ( another great feature of Suan ) !!!
This place has the best interior I have seen anywhere in the northside of W'burg , and will impress whoever you bring there .
We were very disappointed .
I have gone back to Siam Square many times since and everytime I am very satisfied overall .
Terrible Waste of money . . scammers
PERFECT FOR DATES !
Haru on Park S is simply disgusting .
This is a great place to take out-of-towners , and perfect for watching the sunset .
I 've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious .
Inside is a little cramped , but to be expected .
Check this place out !
Even for two very hungry people there is plenty of food left to be taken home ( it reheats really well also ) .
The exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations .
Glechik might be way too tiny for a restaurant by Russian standards , but it is cozy and the food is simply GREAT .
But the staff was so horrible to us .
The server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile .
I went there 2times .
Favorite Sushi in NYC
The corned beef and pastrami are excellent , much less fatty than those big tourist places around Times Square .
My husband and I moved to Nolita 6 years ago and for as long as we have lived here , Peasant has been our favorite !
The food was pretty good , but a little flavorless and the portions very small , including dessert .
Have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience .
Stepping into Casa La Femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in New York !
I choose to go with one of the special , the braised lamb shank in red wine , which was excellent .
An excellent service
I 'll keep this short .
From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff , I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it .
I 'm from England , and Haru 's was the best I had in NYC .
What a great place !
The staff was accomodating , the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely .
the homemade Guacamole , the unbelievable entree , and thee most amazing deserts .
The crust is thin , the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly .
Cute and decorative .
The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day .
But the pizza is way to expensive .
I have walked by this place for eons and finally went thanks to a girls ' night .
Owner is pleasant and entertaining .
i love their chicken pasta cant remember the name but is sooo good
The food was boring and expensive .
I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window .
A weakness is the chicken in the salads .
They could n't even make a salad that was appealing .
In terms of the food itself -- nothing special , we limited ourselves to several appetizers .
i 've been back to nha trang literally a hundred times for the beef cubes - they 're that good .
it is not consistent .
Great food at reasonable prices .
Truly the mark of an attentive waiter .
A classic !
I think the restaurant was too loud ( when full ) to be romantic .
I ca n't imagine how much worse it would have been if we 'd gone at a prime time !
We ordered our appetizers , I ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon .
The baked clams octopus we shared as appetizers were the best we 've ever had !!
They also do a great job for restaurant week .
Great food .
their brunch menu had something for everyone .
Casa La Femme is to middle eastern dining what Chuckie Cheeze is to italian .
The service was attentive , yet discreet .
They specialize in smoothies and fresh juices .
The sushi is also great !
They even scoop it out nice ( for those on a diet ) not too much not to little .
While we enjoyed the food , we were highly disappointed by the poor service ( waiter was not quite competent and SLOW service ) and lack of remorse .
the atmosphere is very nice , and a welcome escape from the rest of the SI mall .
The lobster knuckles ( special of the day ) were ok , but pretty tasteless .
I hate this .
The Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience .
Oh , do n't even let me start with how expensive the bills were !
This is the Jackel and Hideof the restaurants on the UES .
It costs $ 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll , but the roll more than triples in size , and that 's not just from the rice .
Creative , consistent , fresh .
The worst excuse for Japanese food I 've ever encountered .
The service was excellent , the food was excellent , but the entire experience was very cool .
I went here with my boyfriend and another couple .
Katz 's deli is a great NY experience .
This place was not ALL THAT !
However , I think this place is a good hang out spot .
I grew up on these bagels .
Based on the reviews for dinner , this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that , but definitely not for Dim Sum again .
The food there are sastifying .
This place is not worth the prices .
We also had shared a house salad that was fresh .
the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce ( even its low sodium ) , the vinegar-soaked rice , and the scallion on top of the fish .
Mizu is the Japenese find in Grammercy .
We were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem .
People are always friendly .
The food was great and the service was even better .
Leon is an East Village gem : casual but hip , with well prepared basic French bistro fare , good specials , a warm and lively atmosphere .
My sister says it reminds her of a restaurant run by high-school students who do n't know what they are doing .
Here 's the thing , you 're in the best city in the world for restaurants .
Yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously , but it should n't .
We arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly .
For some reason the place was empty when we got in and remained so for the entire evening , I do n't understand why but we had a blast and will definately go back the next time we are in the area .
Great restaurant , and even greater food !
You guys are awesome !
We had a party in their private room and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning .
The waitstaff are all very busy , it 's not outstanding service , but I 've never been dealt with rudely .
Decor needs to be upgraded but the food is amazing !
They do n't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai .
The service is always bad though , do n't expect much of anything from your server , and I would not recommend bringing a date here either .
My chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily .
I 'm from sichuan , this is the restaurant I recommend going .
The only thing more wonderful than the food ( which is exceptional ) is the service .
I went to Del Frisco 's Friday night with my boyfriend for an 8:00 reservation .
Loved It
Food does n't appear to be cooked on premisis but there 's a high turnover so its pretty fresh .
Who has room for Cheesesticks with the best pizza in NYC !
Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable , makes students go back to Suan again and again .
The restaraurant is very small so reservations are a must .
If you live in Upper Manhattan , Siam Square is THE place for Thia food .
Open late ( well as late as I ever got there and I 'm a night person )
Great selection of wine , and seafood .
I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side .
I highly recommend it for not just its superb cuisine , but also for its friendly owners and staff .
From the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the place was packed .
Okay-i do n't mind the oily part ( cause most are cooked that way ) but it was way too bland .
If you love seafood , you would love this place !
My wife had barely touched that mess of a dish .
The makhani was OK -- the korma was bland .
The kitchen however , is almost always slow .
The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date .
It 's true , this place is not cheap .
I am happy i did the food was awsome .
Their sake martini is wonderful .
All in all , this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city .
never swaying , never a bad meal , never bad service ...
Great Indian food and the service is incredible .
A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning !
Siam Square is fairly new to the neighborhood and I think in time will gain the recognition it deserves .
Example is the soup which was about 6 oz for $ 12 dollars and the mushrooms where $ 12 for about 1oz .
Which lets face it .... at times it 's a good thing .
When we walked in it seemed like it was there for 200 years .
We parked on the block of Nina 's the place looked nice , with people obviously enjoying their pizzas .
The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it .
The ambiance was fine , a little loud but still nice and romantic .
The waiters were not attentive except that the bill turned up on the table before we were finished .
The location is perfect .
The quantity is also very good , you will come out satisfied .
Save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one !
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date .
That place was awesome , , , sally !
BTW , the service is very good .
Raga 's is a romantic , cozy restaurant .
Having moved I truly miss this place .
Would you ever believe that when you complain about over an hour wait , when they tell you it will be 20-30 minutes , the manager tells the bartender to spill the drinks you just paid for ?
My husband and I enjoy Sangria .
We all felt it was worth it .
This is n't a value joint .
The room is a little plain , but it 's difficult to make such a small place exciting and I would not suggest that as a reason not to go .
Great wine selection , Gigondas is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value .
My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .
Their sake list was extensive , but we were looking for Purple Haze , which was n't listed but made for us upon request !
