The prices were fantastic .
I had a great experience .
The Yellowtail was particularly good as well .
Food was OK - fish was cooked well .
Satay is one of those favorite haunts on Washington where the service and food is always on the money .
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere .
good food good wine that 's it .
The secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered .
The staff is n't the friendliest or most competent , and I am stickler for service , but everything else about this place makes up for it .
So close , but not good enough .
Despite the fact that the space is large , they 've overcrowded the floor with tables .
Over priced , overrated .... stay away !
If you 're looking for a great meal at a decent price , go to Del Frisco 's !
I took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and I have never , in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms .
The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees .
Great Shabu Shabu
From the erbazzone emiliana to the mostarda on the cheese plate , the dishes at this restaurant are all handled with delicate care .
If you 're not familiar with the cuisine , you may encounter problems ordering here and be sure to bring plenty of cash with you as they do n't accept credit cards .
At 6:30 , we were the third party there .
The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices .
I 've been there a few times , and I usually end up sitting next to some pretty odd people .
We ate out in the back patio , which is worth it as it 's cool and the music is hear well there .
BE CAREFUL before you request extra spice .
I just have nothing to say about this place that is negative except that it 's not a cheap night out ... but it 's SO worth it .
Their eggplant is so delicate , sweet tender !
go here for the drinks !
What a great place !
The food however , is what one might expect .
I love this place
We actually gave 10 % tip ( which we have never done despite mediocre food and service ) , because we felt totally ripped off .
The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard .
I 've been here twice now .
we spent 50 $ $ definetly will come back with my friends !!!
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian .
We were very impressed with the food and value .
I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna .
They forgot a sandwich , did n't include plastic forks , and did n't include pita with the hummus platter .
I had Filet Mignon with garlic mash .
I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends , and spent three enjoyable hours there .
SUM IT : local investment bankers like it , try for yourself at least once .
Average to good Thai food , but terrible delivery .
I had a late dinner at Lucky Stike , a great name for a joint if ever I saw one .
The food however , is what one might expect .
Everything is always cooked to perfection , the service is excellent , the decor cool and understated .
Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you .
The floor was wet , the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor , no soap , and no hand towels left .
Service is not exactly five star , but thats not really a big deal .
Bay Terrace mall is nothing ( ok , almost nothing ) without it !
Worse of all , $ 60 was erroneously added to our $ 80 bill .
We had the lobster sandwich and it was FANTASTIC .
Our first greeting when we entered was The last call is at 10:15 .
I would definitely come back to this restaurant .
We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night .
The characters really make for an enjoyable experience .
For two people with tip was less than $ 25 bucks .
Frites were delicious if a bit on the thick side .
Oh , and there 's hookah .
We spent $ 200 in this place and left hungry and very disappointed .
Ambience is delightful , service impeccable .
We were pleasantly surprised .
I have been to Rao 's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better .
The Pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down , it was a pleasurable experience .
Ask for the round corner table next to the large window .
And Kruno , the beverage manager is the best bartender I have yet to come across .
A very inviting restaurant , with friendly service .
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny .
All the NYU students love this place so it makes for a fun young atmosphere .
Also they were $ 15 each !
Beautiful experience .
I have eaten at some of the ' best ' sushi joints in NYC ( Nobu , Bond Street , JewelBako , etc ) and Yamato is my favorite .
Their calzones are horrific , bad , vomit-inducing , YUCK .
The food was average to above-average ; the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive , and the desserts not brilliant in any way .
The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well .
Loved it
The staff offers impeccable service .
At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at Bark you do n't just get your average hot dog .
My husband and I enjoyed each of the 6 taste size portions and left completely full .
Entrees include classics like lasagna , fettuccine Alfredo and chicken parmigiana .
The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food .
Maybe it was just an unintentional mistake but I 've experienced the same with other restaurants so I do n't appreciate such practice .
Mussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening .
For all you lazy folks that do n't want to come to Alphabet City , I say , good - stay out .
People dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans .
Worth the trip from Manhattan .
Every waitress and customer who passed by me bumped into my chair .
In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food , this is one of the best spots .
So rude .
With the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room .
Ahhh ...
Montparnasse 's desserts -- especially the silken creme brulee and paper-thin apple tart -- are good enough on their own to make the restaurant worth the trip .
The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water .
great eats , good times .
However , service was as plain as sesame crusted Salmon I had .
Even though its good seafood , the prices are too high .
We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods .
The food is great .
This particular location certainly uses substandard meats .
Delivery service is great too .
I 've been frequenting The Tasting Room since it first arrived in the East Village and I 've never been disappointed .
The food is very average ... the Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet , every thing they serve is too sweet here .
If you go for the pre-theatre menu , it 's an even greater deal .
The food was just OK , at least for what food was available .
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!
All of the apetizers are good and the Sangria is very good .
We do not need to go to a four-star restaurant anymore .
Good for dates or with friends .
From the entrees to the sides to the drinks , everything was creatively prepared yet still simple .
While the room is not particularly comfortable , once you 're seated you 'll forget about everything except what 's on your plate .
The falafal was rather over cooked and dried but the chicken was fine .
Went with mommy ( the only person who could afford taking me here ) .
Kenny the owner is always there and he treats my family like we are part of his family .
I had the Lamb special which was perfect .
The service was pretty poor all around , the food was well below average relative to the cost , and outside there is a crazy bum who harasses every customer who leaves the place .
While this is n't classical restaurant fare , the chef has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely Indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burn-outs .
Sexy .
The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date .
Just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday .
The service was on point - what else you would expect from a Ritz ?
This lovely French-Asian fusion restaurant stands out amongst other great restaurants on Smith Street .
The Steak Tartare is a great bet , they fix it for you at the table .
Wo n't or Ca n't is not in the service directory .
Just stick with the small dishes !
This place is not worth the prices .
The restaurant has a Family feel , not least with regard to the portions which are enormous ; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine .
I live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of The Pizza Place at 3am .
I was at Rao 's last Wed .
Still , any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house ...
Had a late night dinner on a Saturday night .
THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too -- but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area .
What makes this restaurant special are the authentic sichuan cooking and being the only one in NYC that offers authentic chongqing hotpot .
The place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious .
On the way out , we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues .
Why do people rave about the ambience .
The service leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are rushed the place your order , to being ignored the rest of the night .
Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer .
Great food ( spinach and corn dumplings and massamman curry ) , very friendly and no nonsense service and a clean and funky bathroom .
The tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent .
I 've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times , but more often I order delivery .
How do you rate home ?
As a retired hipster , I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city .
Everything from the eggs benedict to the mussels and even the hamburger were done well and very tasty .
It 's eaten with black vinegar and shredded ginger .
Of course this atmosphere is lacking , but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel place anyways ?
If you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained , this is a great place to go and eat .
esp . during happy hour !
As a fan of Thai , I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst .
i would just ask for no oil next time .
Then , to top things off , she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend 's jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes .
They have it all -- great price , food , and service .
Tuk Tuk is one of the rare choices for me to go in Brooklyn .
Its a go-to for dates as well as entertaining out of town guests .
Mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila .
Get the pepperoni - YUM - and a family style salad .
From the street it looks very hidden , and is actually an old warehouse .
I find that most Kosher restaurants are average to good , but this has been the best I 've eaten so far .
I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night .
The farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty .
I really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi ( on saffron risotto-yum ! ) .
It is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late , raucus dinner .
Great spot , whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner .
The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed .
THe back garden sitting area is very pleasant , where you can see their personal herb garden .
I have tried the various slice joints around the village but this is by far the best one .
The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were .
There is no excuse for such lousy service !
You must try the garlic soup !
Downtown Dinner 2002 - Prixe fix : Appetizers were ok , waiter gave me poor suggestion . . try the potato stuff kanish best one .
It might have been a little too spicy for my friend , which you can couteract with eat more rice and keeping water on hand .
Overall , excellent restaurant !
If you wrote a bad review , it 's because you do n't understand what Rao 's is all about .
Not too much so , but enough that there 's a great scene .
Visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews .
This place has ruined me for neighborhood sushi .
after dining at B.O.G over twenty times now , its official !
I was with a party of 7 ( close but not next the the front doors ) and we were eating with our coats on .
Our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken ( usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats ) .
big and soft as well as good lunch food .
All the appetizers and salads were fabulous , the steak was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious !!!
The food tasted very good .
Seating is always prompt , though the restaurant does fill up in the evening .
I 'm looking forward to going back soon and eventually trying most everything on the menu !
Le Pere Pinard has a $ 15 pre-theater menu that is outstanding .
The restaurant was packed at first , so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated .
The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned .
This is a typical example of an establishment in which its owners do not know anything about the restaurant business !
You will be very happy with the experience .
Have been several times and it never dissapoints .
All of it was simply amazing , unique and tasty and best of all it did n't break the bank .
still stay away , the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were serves eventhough they were there much longer ...
Chef Vincenzo , always there if you need him , is a real talent and a real Roman .
We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu .
Do n't go alone --- even two people is n't enough for the whole experience , with pickles and a selection of meats and seafoods .
If you are here as a pre-show meal , hop in a cab and take the extra 10 minutes to go to the uptown location .
This tiny Williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising .
Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
I was a little leary about Mary 's at first - it 's small , crowded and you usually have to wait on line - but I 'm glad I finally tried it .
Great place to relax and enjoy your dinner
To celebrate a birthday , three of us went to Mare anticipating great food .
I like the ambience , it 's very dark and original .
The staff was accomodating , the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely .
You wo n't find that anywhere in Manhattan .
but I would n't wan na live there .
While there 's a decent menu , it should n't take ten minutes to get your drinks and 45 for a dessert pizza .
We had a 3 hour brunch - they definitely do not rush you - and they kept the unlimited mimosas flowing the whole time .
THE FRANKENSTEIN SHOW WAS THE BEST .
Nice ambiance , nice little bar , good bartender , Francois , and good service .
But they 've done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials like the Godmother pizza ( a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil-brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual ) .
Why make a reservation if you are n't going to keep it ?
this without question is one of the worst hotdogs i have ever had .
Ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me .
The worst excuse for Japanese food I 've ever encountered .
I started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two .
Prices are in line .
People in the neighborhood seem to love it , too .
It was a very nice surprise .
Chennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city .
I 've been to several places for Dim Sum and this has got to be the WORST .
for Meetball Night .
Aside from the bearded , courdoroy blazer professor type with the NYU student he 's sleeping with that week , you see a strange mix of hipsters , frat boys , Will Smith types who need to be told they are black , bitter cougars who cant understand why they arent married yet ....
The cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee !!
Mizu is the Japenese find in Grammercy .
Everything about this restaurant was special .
This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time .
As a long-time patron of Mamoun 's , I always figured that I had found the best late night food spot in the city .
Once they ran out of Gnochi and made it for me from scratch !
Went last Thursday .
I do n't like Indian food too much and this was delicious , however you want to factor that into the equation .
MMmmm ... it was delicious .
NO PIZZA 33 for me !
This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down .
Only wine and beer are served , but the house varities are actually quite good .
I was glad I did .
The one up front will smile and say What can I get for you , brother ?
The best pad thai i 've ever had .
Went on a 3 day oyster binge , with Fish bringing up the closing , and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended , because it was so great !
Both are delicious , the cooks are friendly and are willing to take a moment and speak to you and shake your hand .
Loved it !
And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic .
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere .
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service .
The Waitstaff were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal .
The Bagels have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture , both chewy yet not gummy .
As there were so many to choose from we wandered up and down the street looking in the windows and such noticicing many empty seats , except at Taj Mahal .
amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages PLEASE do yourself a favor and check this place out !!!!
Katz 's has been a NYC original for over 100 years .
The ambience is very calm and quiet .
The service was poor , restaurant poorly lit , staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald 's than this joint .
The counter service is bad .
Although somewhat loud , the noise was minimally intrusive .
I loved this place !!
Dishes denoted as " Roy 's Classics " ( marked on the menu with asterisks ) are tried-and-true recipes , such as macadamia-crusted mahi mahi , or subtly sweet honey-mustard beef short ribs .
I absolutely Loved this place .
I have to agree with the previous reviewer .
I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently .
Do n't waste your time , or money !!
Consequently , their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did ' nt feel like finishing them .
Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES , I get angry that I did n't just go to Zucchero Pomodori .
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested .
Interesting other dishes for a change include chicken in curry sauce and salmon caserole .
Oh yeah ever on the west side try there sister resturant Arties Cafe .
This place is incredibly tiny .
I 'm going back .
The first time the sushi was outstanding , the second time it was a little bland .
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place .
Unless you are eating in the Pizzeria side of this place , and are not in a rush , this place is a bad idea .
Made my dining experience uncomfortable .
We were offered water for the table but were not told the Voss bottles of water were $ 8 a piece .
Really nice restaurant to go with a group or on a date .
We recently spent New Year 's Eve at the restaurant , and had a great experience , from the wine to the dessert menu .
The food is so cheap and the waiters are nice .
Our waiter and all of the people helping him were attentive and genuine .
I go out to eat and like my courses , servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink .
You want to have a real hot dog in Brooklyn ?
This is one of the best comfort food places in the city .
The hostess said " Wow that 's a large group , unless you are n't together " , to which I replied " no we are , and there will be one more , so a table for six please . "
The place is a lot of fun .
My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better .
The Yellowtail was particularly good as well .
Really though , where 's the seasoning ?
You are treated just like royality .
Unfortunately , the food is outstanding , but everything else about this restaurant is the pits .
Its also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car ( I happen to live in Inwood ) .
First went here to enjoy their garden terrace .
Do n't look down your nose at me like that ...
But on a lazy Saturday night , we ended up going .
It 's popular w/the late crowd .
I came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband .
Went there last night for 2 year anniversery , and was n't all that impressed .
One of the more authentic Shanghainese restaurants in the US definitely the best in Manhattan Chinatown .
I 've had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times , when I have been in the neighborhood .
We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night .
The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates .
The atmosphere is nothing special , but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo .
Terrible experience .
This establishment is the real deal .
Food is excellent quality for a good restaurant price .
Food was OK .
Suan is a great place that I often take my friends ( classmates ) too .
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service .
they really provide a relaxing , laid-back atmosphere .
We 've tried before but it always packed and does n't take reservations .
It 's worthwhile to take a cab to Chelsea just for an awesome dinner at My Chelsea .
The food was very good , a great deal , and the place its self was great .
Orsay , is a very pleasnt throw back to traditional French food , and French service as well .
The entree was bland and small , dessert was not inspired .
The owners and employees are friendly and their pizza is fantastic .
The large selection of bruschettas , paninis , tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating .
Faan is sooo good .
The appetizers are also delicious !
Service is great , takeout is good too .
We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai .
Beware of the chili signed food items not unless you want to call the fire department to douse the flames in your mouth .
Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes .
Service is highly refined : our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress .
Delicious food , excellent service , and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $ 5.99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch !
during busy hrs , i recommend that you make a reservation .
We go often .
The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate .
We were told that they were booked solid and no other table was available .
I do n't think I would go again .
The service , however , is a peg or two below the quality of food ( horrible bartenders ) , and the clientele , for the most part , are rowdy , loud-mouthed commuters ( this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff ) getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game .
I went there with my friend last saturday .
I agree .
BUT not in a good way .
The price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate .
Starters : Kobe Beef Sashimi .
The fajita we tried was tasteless and burned and the mole sauce was way too sweet .
It was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York , and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to New York .
Finally a curry that I can eat , enjoy and not suffer from gastritis from 3 hours later .
Nothing better than buying a snapple for $ 3.25 too .
The meat is fresh , the sauces are great , you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too .
The Dancing , White River and Millenium rolls are musts .
Though the Spider Roll may look like a challenge to eat , with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll , it is well worth the price you pay for them .
For those prices and the dressed up atmosphere you expect more and should get more .
Chennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city .
Will give it another chance before I write it off .
I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others .
We usually go to the Chart House to celebrate a birthday or anniversary .
Food is excellent and they also have empenadas and plaintains which are good for an afternoon snack .
Last memorial day , I tried to make reservations but was told they were closed that weekend ( interesting , but ... ) .
This was the perfect quiet , relaxing , and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater .
It was tiny and I felt like I was eating in someone 's living room .
I know because I live nearby .
Cool atmosphere , the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night .
Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights .
sometimes i get good food and ok service .
Definitely try the calamari , any pasta , or even the Sliced steak entree .
I 've been coming here on and off for the past five years and I have to say that La Lanterna has never , ever dissapointed me .
The waiter was attentive .
Also , the sandwiches ( nearing $ 7 ) did n't come with anything like chips or a side .
Furthermore , the rice had no seasoning , so the sushi was bland and disgusting .
They 're rude at times , and not very friendly .
Best Chinese on the Upper East , prompt delivery , good value .
Good service , great food , good value , and never have to wait in line !
The dosas are skimpy , unattractive and drip with grease , and personally I 'd drink popcorn topping before I 'd eat another one of these .
Their sake list was extensive , but we were looking for Purple Haze , which was n't listed but made for us upon request !
Priced at upper intermediate range .
I asked for seltzer with lime , no ice .
A gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order .
Yes , the prices are high , but I felt it was worth it .
Where Gabriela personaly greets you and recommends you what to eat .
I have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .
But , nothing stands out about the cooking .
And evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful .
The foie gras was sweet and luscious .
We had great desserts ( including the best cannoli I 've ever had ) and then they offered an after dinner drink , on the house .
Waiters tend to forget drinks completely , food portions are so tiny , two people have trouble sharing one entree .
I honestly do n't even know where to begin .
My husband and I have been sold on this from the first visit .
Their exotic salad is basic ly a delcious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu .
Great food at REASONABLE prices , makes for an evening that ca n't be beat !
However , once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option ) , I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .
When my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .
Had a late night dinner on a Saturday night .
First went here to enjoy their garden terrace .
We also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka .
Turned out there was full service upstairs and sat down .
However it is the ONLY Taiwanese restaurant in town .
Not to be overlooked , the service is excellent .
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for a first date .
Not impressed with the food .
But if you 're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary , then this is the place to go for Indian food
The Thai ice tea was amazingly smooth and yummy !
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm .
If you 're looking for a place to sit down , have a drink and conversations with friends , go to sweet-n-tart and order yourself a hong-kong styled milk and tea with tapioca pearls ( hot ) .
I can not imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant .
those rolls were big , but not good and sashimi was n't fresh .
I had to flag down a third staff person for a fork ... so now it 's goodbye Little RUDE Pie Company .
Everything we had was pretty good , but we have only been there once .
Great food , good size menu , great service and an unpretensious setting .
Sushi was n't anything spectacular for the price .
The place is sleek , modern and playfull and i will return again frequently .
Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room ( no matter what the size of your party ) , the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters - you 'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you 're in .
Oh , and I never write reviews -- I just was so moved by how bad this place was , I felt it was my duty to spread the word .
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us .
If you 're craving for Haru 's great food , especially the House Roll , but ca n't stand the wait building outisde , head across the street to their Sake Bar !
Not the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant .
I think I 've had some the best meals of my life at minnow .
The menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent .
everyone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful .
This place is a must visit !
Read all the other review , they 'll confirm it .
I heard the lobster roll was excellent .
The location and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it .
I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries .
The server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile .
My boyfriend had Prime Rib it was good .
The waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order .
Went inside and I started to get excited .
The food is so good and so popular that waiting can really be a nightmare .
My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time !
I must say it 's a little pricey for the food because it was not as spectacular as the view .
This is a twenty-something guy that does n't mind laying down $ 300 for a fine and delicious meal for 2 on special occassions .
Every time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street .
My husband said he could 've eaten several more , the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had .
Even though its good seafood , the prices are too high .
It 's the kind of place I like to support !
Polite acknowledgement is out ;
When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not Mcdonald 's , every place makes things differently
The service was a bit slow and the portions are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush , this is not the place for you .
The food was exceptional .
Just remember , the later you go , the longer you may have to wait .
The most annoying thing , though , is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue .
I love Ess-a-bagel , but I live on the west side , so I often go to Murray 's for convenience .
Please take my advice , go and try this place .
The service was attentive , yet unimposing , the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced .
Every time I visit NYC , I come here .
I would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices .
They outshine HH .
But people from Sichuan will die for it ) - Chongqing Hot Pot , chongqing was the biggest city of Sichuan , now became an independent province .
Overall I would recommend it and go back again .
( i hang out , and live , in the neighborhood . . )
this place is amazingly bad .
We have lived in Chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant .
This Thai restaurant is a couple blocks away from Sripraphai ( another delicious Thai restaurant ) .
Drawbacks : service is slow and they do n't toast !
They kindly brought us more to see if it was better , but it was not !
I loving bringing friends here - and I do so every chance I get .
The other times I 've gone it 's romantic date heaven , you can walk in get a booth by the windows , be treated like a VIP in a not-crowded place , with great food and service .
but when we looked at the menu , there were n't a lot of choices , most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section .
My first encounter happened one friday evening with a friend .
Definitely worth the trip to Battery Park City !
We were very surprised by how good the food was on our first visit here on a Sunday night .
If you 'd like to have a nice light meal with an asian accent , Long Tan is a good place on the slope .
Did I mention that the coffee is OUTSTANDING ?
Just straight up cheap , good food .
The dim sum servings here are a bit larger than I 'm used to .
I read about this place in Time Out magazine .
I love it .
( 1 ) turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of Mott St. just south of bayard
Despite a slightly limited menu , everything prepared is done to perfection , ultra fresh and a work of food art .
Even after a few bad evenings at Bardolino , I keep coming back .
Over all it was a very nice romantic place .
Never once did I leave feeling unwelcome or impressed .
I lived on 50th st , and wanted Indian one day so decided to check this place out .
We were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry .
We will be back .
Everyone was more then happy with his choices .
The place was nice and calm .
When we stumbled on Leon , we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT , we were certainly wrong .
This was on a Tuesday night .
The dessert ( we had a pear torte ) was good - but , once again , the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions .
The dinner was ok , nothing I would have again .
What ?
However , it just so happens that there 's an even more amazing place just down the street .
Trust me .
All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better !
i have eaten here on a different occasion - the food is mediocre for the prices .
Culinaria is a welcome addition to the Garment district - far better than any restaurant in the area .
Too bad , has a lot of potential .
Wine list is extensive without being over-priced .
the turkey burgers are scary !
Good for casual dinner with jeans and sneakers .
The service is awful .
Also , the staff is very attentive and really personable .
This is the best thing in Soho .
But that is highly forgivable .
Staff is accomodating make sure you are satified .
In summer-eat outside on a terrace ( another great feature of Suan ) !!!
Love the scene first off - the place has a character and nice light to it . . very fortunate , location wise .
And its absolutely DELICIOUS .
Hopefully next time , I will save room for dessert .
Food is great .
Everyone was smiling so that made me feel welcome .
Fabulous service , fantastic food , and a chilled out atmosphere and environment .
We had the most wonderful waitress .
Give it a try and enjoy .
The sauce is delicious and the crust is perfect .
I love the Little Pie Company as much as anyone else who has written reviews , but must discourage anyone from visiting the Grand Central location due to their RUDE service from two sales people .
The menu is nothing like the one on the website .
( I 've ordered from the 2nd ave.
Shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here : simple contract , deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20 .
I wish they had one near my office - I would go everyday .
Go there on an empty stomach and leave feeling like a baby Veal Calf ( ok bad joke ) , but you will see .
We will be back .
It was pretty inexpensive too .
The dim sum here is only so-so .
We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves .
However , looking at the table next to ours , we both sort of wished we had ordered pizza , which looked PERRRRRRRRRFECT .
Will never be back .
Great pizza for lunch place .
Desserts include flan and sopaipillas .
bad staff
I would highly recommend .
If you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave.
we love th pink pony .
Rude service , medicore food ... there are tons of restaurants in NY ... stay away from this one
Tasty but expensive .
Food is usually very good , though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders .
When it came time to take the order the waiter gave us a hard time , walked away then came back with a paper and pen for us to write down what we wanted ... excuse me but is n't that his job ???
Not worth the prices .
If you ware looking for Korean fusion , I suggest you try some of the places in the East Village .
Ummm ... the beer was cold .
My boyfriend and I are avid restaurant goers , and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended Flatbush Farms .
And you never get the feeling that you need to leave .
We did n't know if we should order a drink or leave ?
I almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded .
I 've rarely had a problem with slow staff in the 10 years I 've been going .
The food they serve is not comforting , not appetizing and uncooked .
This is probably one of my new favorite places .
Ask for Usha , the nicest bartender in manhattan .
Everything I had was good , and I 'm a eater .
And that 's no mean feat ...
We had fun eating in there , we were there like around 3 a.m. in the morning !
I really liked the noodle dishes at Rice Avenue compared to their Green Curry dish .
An excellent choice in midtown .
We have been to this place many times , and always have great food , wine , and service .
For instance , plates were just dumped on the table , I was handed the wine list upside down , etc. ...
just got back from lunch at Tamarind and it was excellent .
The food was good .
Good French restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you 're into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at Katz ' Deli , or Mexican food which is supplied by capable restaurants .
We began with the cheese fondue ( the artisanal blend ) and added apples and kielbasa to dip .
Recommendations , of course , are required !
I was really disappointed ant wanted to tell everyone not to go eat or even take out food from there .
A different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) .
There are other Vietnamese restaurants in the chinatown area and you can forget about those .
Alias is warm and cozy and you do n't get that squished-in feeling you get at 71 Clinton .
We all had the tasting menu and unlike some of the other reviews , I felt there was more than enough food .
Although the place could be a little more eye catching and roomier , at the same time , it does n't really matter .
I recieved prompt service with a smile .
I was literally going to explode , but instead , my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager .
I was pleasantly suprised .
Avoid this place !
Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City
Not only do they have the best escargot in town , they always try to accomodate our toddler .
The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard .
My friend 's food was also the complete opposite of what it 's supposed to taste like ( aND look like ) .
I 'm going back .
Both times we waited well over a half hour for a table ( even though we had reservations ) .
Love YUKA .
I 'll be back soon .
We came across this restaurant by accident while at a DUMBO art festival and thoroughly enjoyed our meal .
Food was average but tasty .
Taking Hot Dogs to the next level
The food is terrible and overall , I would have to say avoid at all costs .
Good luck getting a table .
Ambience is delightful , service impeccable .
We love the food , drinks , and atmosphere !
In fact , you ca n't miss it .
This place does n't make any sense
I love this cozy around the way Rest .
The grilled cheese at home afterwards was better . !!
Even the pasta is delicious here ( a rarity in New York pizza restaurants ) .
There is a real gallery of stars that have visited .
Food was just average ... if they lowered the prices just a bit , it would be a bigger draw .
If you 've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer .
I think the pizza is so overrated and was under cooked .
This restaurant used to be our regular Thursday night dinner location .
I 've never ordered anything else from their menu ... there 's no need to .
I lOVE THIS PLACE !
Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth .
If you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave.
Otherwise , this place has great service and prices and a nice friendly atmosphere .
Open late ( well as late as I ever got there and I 'm a night person )
The food , served in small tasting portions ( as an option ) is very good with each dish being better than the next .
But $ 1 for each small piece ???
Great service , great food .
If you ’re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ’ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) .
Aside from the rushed service , we were very impressed with the food and the drinks .
This is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together .
I came here for my friend 's birthday and keep coming back ever since .
I have to say I have never had a disapointing meal here .
I ca n't believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food !
Unlike HH up the block , this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels this town is known for .
We ordered dosut bibimbap and nakgi-bokum .
I CAN EAT HERE EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK REALLY LOL LOVE THIS PLACE ... )
Service was prompt , friendly and great .
It was such a fantastic dining experience , that I returned again the same week .
Also , if you do n't want to sit at a certain table , you do n't have to !
The counter service is bad .
The strong scents coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds .
It is thick and slightly soggy .
it 's the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food .
The food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare , the dishes are never a disappointment .
The food is top notch , the service is attentive , and the atmosphere is great .
Desserts are almost incredible : my personal favorite is their Tart of the Day .
The ambience was nice , but service was n't so great .
Its not the same if you have to sit inside .
The service , wine selection , ambiance are all outstanding and deserve recognition .
I do n't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer .
I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A.
Not terrible , but not the restaurant in the reviews of 2002 .
The production is a symphony , alot of fun to experience.The food sublime for the most part .
The fish was adequate , but inexpertly sliced .
In any event , even though its a bit on the pricey side , we still love this restaurant and will definitely go back .
The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty .
Went here on a friend 's reccomendation .
I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fine Indian dining experience that is definitely a value for your dollar .
This place is a great stop for great food .
We asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order .
I will definetely go back again and again , that 's for sure !!!
The wine list was extensive - though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings .
Always a nice crowd , but never loud .
The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion ( maybe 3 of each ) .
I generally like this place .
So , if yo really do n't care who is sittingnext to you , which is about 2 inches away , I would say try it .
One of us actually liked the expresso - that 's it .
Good food .
You can not go wrong at the Red Eye Grill .
The bibimbap was average , but the stone bowl was n't even close to sizzling .
They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another .
Delicate spices , onions , eggs and a kick-ass roti .
The food was bland oily .
Will have to return to try the chocolate !
The appetizers are ok , but the service is slow .
Chance is a small cozy restaurant , with a romantic feel to it , the decor is great .
My mom originally introduced me to this place , but even she ( being Indian ) feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily .
From the incredible food , to the warm atmosphere , to the friendly service , this downtown neighborhood spot does n't miss a beat .
Some baby pizzas get their wish .
They are by far the BEST past in New York .
The price very reasonable .
Also , specify if you like your food spicy - its rather bland if you do n't .
It is nearly impossible to get a table , so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner , DO NOT pass it up .
The atmosphere is n't the greatest , but I suppose that 's how they keep the prices down .
head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st , taj mahal is also very comparable , in food quality , to the much overpraised ( and underdeserving ) baluchi 's .
Service was excellent , and the AC worked very well too ( thank God , it was hot ! ) .
After all that , they complained to me about the small tip .
The food was amazing , the service was so attentive and personable , and how about that ambience !
They 've the best desserts and mixed drinks as well as snack foods .
I plan on eating here more often .
Not only is the food authentic , but the staff here are practically off-the-boat , they are young and hip and know what they are doing when it comes to food and wine .
Overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites , but everything was delicious .
The dim sum however was very good .
And even with it 's Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too !
For someone who used to hate Indian food , Baluchi 's has changed my mid .
These innovators of french indian fusion do a great job of making dishes as interesting as possible while still being accessible .
The first time I went , and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere , I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad .
Everything , from the soft bread , soggy salad , and 50 minute wait time , with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average food .
The spicy tuna and salmon are the best we 've ever had .
We concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake , both were delicious .
Fabulous food - if the front of house staff do n't put you off –
The staff makes you feel at home , the food is great and the atmosphere is WONDERFUL !
I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of .
Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens , this is among the best .
The characters really make for an enjoyable experience .
Much more reasonably priced too !
They bring a sauce cart up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your steak ( I tried them ALL ) .
The sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are innovative and delicious .
You can also special order any kind of dumpling , etc .
We liked it so much , that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York .
Our friends have not arrived yet .
If you have a dumpling fetish i suggest you try some here !
You wo n't be dissapointed .
Oh , and the complimentary pudding dessert was just enough - yummy !
I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service .
Tiny restaurant with very fast service .
If you want to save some money , do n't go here .
Quite frankly , this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried .
Bring your date and a bottle of wine !
If you are a vegetarian , this really is n't a good place to go .
If I could rate the people this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza , sorry - not the best in NYC .
Great food , great prices , great service .
great taste
The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale .
It 's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone .
If you 're craving some serious indian food and desire a cozy ambiance , this is quite and exquisite choice .
I got enough reasons to keep coming back !!!
now if they could only get a toaster .
The food was very good and I was pleasantly surprised to see so many vegan options .
Nick Stef 's is one of the only places worthy of going in the area , so if you happen to be by Madison Square Garden or Herald 's Square check it out !
Most of the sandwiches are made with soy mayonaise which is actually pretty good .
The fried rice is amazing here .
This place has totally weird decor , stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional ...
Stuffing yourself with Japanese food is a rare thing .
It 's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre food , noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks .
Slow service , but when you 're hanging around with groups of 10 or 20 , who really notices ?
Salads are a delicious way to begin the meal .
Excellent sashimi , and the millennium roll is beyond delicious .
The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful .
Well , their deliveries take for ever and the food is usually cold .
The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive .
The bartender on my most recent visit was so incredibly rude that I will never go back .
the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside .
I loved it .
I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .
So , a little inconsistency there but either way , both pizzas were really good .
Can be a bit busy around peak times because of the size .
If you 're into being lost when you 're just five feet from your table then hey , that 's a good thing .
That 's good and bad .
Great neighborhood joint .
I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently .
Not worth it .
They smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone .
As a retired hipster , I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city .
Anyway , the food is good , the price is right and they have a decent wine list .
The design and atmosphere is just as good .
If you venture off the island of Manhattan and ca n't seem to find a great Italian restaurant , drive to Corona .
Average cake thats been courted by a LOT of hype .
The service is friendly , if not the most prompt in the world , the food is great , and the prices , while not cheap , wo n't put your wallet out of commission .
The service is pretty good .
I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart 's for their food , the ambience and wonderful service .
I have to agree with the previous reviewer .
The kitchen however , is almost always slow .
Nice find .
It was wonderful .
The red curry is weak and tasteless , the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy , the rice is often overcooked , and the seafood is pretty sketchy .
I consider the best Grand Sichuan restaurant in NYC .
Build a meal with side orders like Amazin ' Greens salads , Buffalo Chicken Kickers and Cinna Stix .
I am going to the mid town location next .
The menu has lots of options : I hope to go back to try those potato pancakes .
If celebrities make you sweat , then your in for a ride , but if your like most around these parts then you 'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype .
The pizza is overpriced and soggy .
I love going there !
Pizzas were excellent in addition to appetizers and main courses .
now called nikki sushi , sushi is OK .
The food is also outstanding and is served quite quickly .
Excellent atmosphere , delicious dishes good and friendly service .
Love their drink menu .
I will be going back and heartily recommend it !
Still , any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house ...
A touch more jalapeno heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed .
My boyfriend and I were in NY for a few days and Pastis was a place that came recommended .
And where does Patis go wrong ; no where .
The burger was great , also .
If presentation and service is your thing , then this magic show works .
I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna .
And comparing it to the Chinatown restaurants is simply not fair .
I really liked this place .
As a fan of Thai , I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst .
The buffet had a nice selection .
Excellent food , although the interior could use some help .
Not only was the food outstanding , but the little ' perks ' were great .
There are other people waiting !
My wife and I were in NYC celebrating our 30th anniversary .
This is the perfect spot for meeting friends , having lunch , dinner , pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks !
The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes .
The food was great .
Single Worst Restaurant in Manhattan
Amma is nothing special .
Kind , attentive wait staff .
The wine list is also really nice .
Very " normal Indian food " , but done really well .
Stay away from the latter since you wo n't go for seconds ( hint hint ) .
In fact , this was not a Nicoise salad and was barely eatable .
Taxan delicious !
I can not imagine you not rushing out to eat there .
My mouth starts to water merely thinking about the delight that is this restaurant .
I pray it stays open forever .
The owner truly caters to all your needs .
Only complaint is the pricing -- I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .
The crackling calamari salad , which is usually a cheap disaster at many restaurants , is crispy and lightly dressed .
Bon appettite !!
What really makes it shine is the food , which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices , and all made in-house ( even the gyro meat and sausages ) , and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected .
I will NEVER return .
All we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner .
The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses !
The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese ( gets a little messy ) .
When I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else .
After dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : Where are you from ... maybe you dont know how things work in America ... and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on .
The overall price tag was very very expensive , something I did expect .
First the wrong bread came out with the appetizer , then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course ...
Terrible , terrible management - deserves to be shut-down .
I completely recommend Casa La Femme for any special occasion and to REALLY impress your date .
Once we finally got a table , despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed !
A beautifully designed dreamy Egyptian restaurant that gets sceney at night .
I would only go for the coffee which is way better than Starbucks or the like .
I found it on a cold night , the perfect spot to warm up .
With all the mundane or mediocre places on 8th avenue it is nice to have one that is a step above in quaility and atmosphere .
The waitress suggested glasses of wine that went very well with the food .
This guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including Paris , that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant .
A little crowded but they move that line really fast !
The wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for Chinatown ) alternative .
The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner .
Would NEVER go back there .
For dinner I had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan .
I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart 's for their food , the ambience and wonderful service .
It 's really a takeaway place , I would n't sit if I could take it home .
Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
I recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal !
The wine list is interesting and has many good values .
Half a chicken with a mountain of rice and beans for $ 6.25 .
From the street it looks very hidden , and is actually an old warehouse .
If you want good tasting , well seasoned latin food eat at Cabana and you ca n't go wrong .
For the people who want great food plus great service , Roxy is a place to AVOID !
Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens , this is among the best .
Was surprisingly disappointed .
Their coffee is quite good too !
Ahhh ...
There was a long wait for a table outside , but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice .
The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome , great appetizer to share !
The staff offers impeccable service .
If you are a Tequila fan you will not be disappointed .
Best Taiwanese food in NY !
I would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard .
I 've made the trip out here a few times with a friend who lives nearby ( I live on UWS ) .
No doubt the next time we want to go out for a special occasion or are entertaining guests from out of town , Spirit and Bateaux will be our destination .
Service is top notch .
Check out the secret back room .
The sauce is zesty and flavorful and the crust is nice and crispy .
No desert menu , no apology , nothing !!!!!!
Calling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance , but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too .
This is a great place to take out-of-towners , and perfect for watching the sunset .
It 's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend .
We picked it randomly , without a recommendation from someone who has been there , so we were n't sure what to expect .
Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood .
I went with JWILS .
All in all the food was above average and I would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners .
I come from a family of pizzeria owners , and I 'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in Fornino 's blows my families receipies away .
I tried a couple other dishes but was n't too impressed .
Chow fun was dry ; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family .
The sauce may not be for everyone , since it is distintive .
Probably my worst dining experience in new york , and I 'm a former waiter so I know what I 'm talking about .
Would not recommend anyone to go .
I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive .
The Cypriot restaurant has a lot going for it .
Not a small feat for good french food in the area .
The ceiling is amazing !
Not the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant .
i would recommend reservations on weekends though .
I must say the view of NYC is so beautiful !
The one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side .
We refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore .
The cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan .
The only drawback is that it 's a little pricey .
Good food at the restaurant ( a bit expensive , but great if you want to impress your date ) .
i would recommend Jewel Bako if you want to feel like you were kicked in the groin and had to pay for it too .
I highly recommend the fish tacos , everything else was ok .
Ess-A-Bagel ( either by Sty-town or midtown ) is by far the best bagel in NY .
Make sure you try this place as often as you can .
Please be aware that it 's CASH or AMEX only !
Could have had better for 1/3 the price in Chinatown .
Try the sea bass .
My order is on my table even on a busy friday night within 10 minutes ( at the most ) of hanging up the phone .
I can say that the wraps , burgers and salads were all fresh , tasty and the mango margareta at $ 9 was WELL WORTH the money .
It 's charmingly small and that leads to an atmoshere that is extremely cozy and romantic , even .
Try the sea bass .
The family seafood entree was very good .
The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal .
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently .
The lunch special is an asbolute steal .
We try frequenting new restaurants all over the city , but any time that we visit a restaurant other than Roth 's we are always disappointed .
People are always friendly .
My husband and I have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the sushi bar ( chef Yoshi ) and ordered everything ala carte .
Rao 's has the best service and atmosphere in NYC .
We were well attended to by the enthusiastic staff especially the manager Tony Gaskin who made excellent suggestions for our menu selections .
Lexicographers take note : a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn .
The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service .
Please take my advice , go and try this place .
It is set far from the small street it 's on , and there is no traffic noise .
So , if you 're walking by and thinking about dining , you might want to see who 's going to be seating you first ...
If you 're looking to taste some great Indian food and want good service , definitely visit Curry Leaf .
I will definetly be going back .
The decor is night tho ... but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling ... its quite un-appetizing , and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern .
The large selection of bruschettas , paninis , tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating .
It only took about five or so minutes to get an empty table , but standing up was n't too bad .
But too far east !
Have eaten at Ginger House several times , and it 's always good .
We went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different .
If you do n't mind pre-sliced low quality fish , unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place .
Also very inexpensive .
It may be a bit packed on weekends , but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area .
Pair you food with the excellent beers on tap or their well priced wine list .
My host asked for appetizers for the group and the waiter gave us not only what we ordered , but some other items that were not ordered .
La Rosa waltzes in , and I think they are doing it the best .
They had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice - RESULT - WE HAD LARGE CHUNKS OF BURNT RICE IN OUR SERVING BOWL .
However , most of them are at least prompt and pleasant .
Have recommended the place to friends , always gets good response .
It is expensive but well worth the money .
Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the thai food is excellent too .
This place is a literal hole-in-the-wall that is buried within Doyers , right off of Pell St ( barber 's alley ) in Chinatown .
After reading the good reviews of this restaurant , I decided to give it a try with two friends .
The steak was very fatty and the sauce was overpowering and not very tasty .
Authentic Pakistani food .
the service is prompt friendly .
I wo n't go back unless someone else is footing the bill .
I 'm in love with the lobster ravioli !
This tiny Williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising .
Should you happen to be impressed by the cuisine definitely try it .
It has good music , nice tapas , an interesting selection of wines ( primarily Spanish ) and a lowkey hip neighborhood clientele .
This place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area .
We have lived in Chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant .
limited menu , no-so-fresh ingredients , thinly-sliced fish , fall-apart rice .
Whether it 's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar , you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite .
For starters they delivered us someone else 's order .
The food was delicious ( I had a halibut special , my husband had steak ) , and the service was top-notch .
But the thing that my wife and I hated was it was so loud and it felt like ' bar ' or ' pub ' .
A con was the slow bar service .
What a great place .
We ordered a glass of wine and were finished eating and paying before the wine came .
They were dry , stale and pretty flavorless .
The svc can be a bit rude at times , esp if you have big group , but overall the restaurant is a must !
My party had the BBE $ 29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake !
The food is good .
Not only is this the best Thai restaurant I have been to , but it also ranks as one of my favorite places to dine .
Good , because hey , it 's more food , but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap .
The mussaman curry that I ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that I ordered in it , they graciously provided me with ONE piece of poorly cooked potato .
I would highly recommend it .
Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything .
I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere !
$ 500 included :
Big thumbs up !
The dishes came out around 5 minutes apart .
I loved it and would go again .
Other apetizers and food
We were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks .
Good cake BUT : it was not the best cake i 've ever had , and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked employees .
We asked for beverages and never received them .
First of all , this place is * not * romantic , as claimed by Citysearch 's editorial review .
However , they 've got the most amazing pastrami and the soups hit the spot .
Worth it for a special occasion , or any time !
The fettucino alfredo was amazing .
Hey , I think $ 2 + for a 5 block walk ai n't bad .
( Besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city ) .
The flavors are great , and the menu is extensive .
Going to Ballato 's is like coming home and eating in my own kitchen , an absolute delight !
I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND .
The food was mediocre and the service was severely slow .
I 've been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got a table .
We 've been following chef Lyle 's food around New York for 15 years and while remaining classic , his innovations with bistro fare have made us return and return .
Staffs are not that friendly , but the taste covers all .
get over it !
The decor is really blah , and not at all hip or happening .
I 'm telling you ...
Reasonable prices .
Save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one !
Between my guest and I , we sampled at least 80 % of the menu , and they were all hits .
Food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience ) .
A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning !
The food was great and tasty , but the sitting space was too small , I do n't like being cramp in a corner .
Joe 's Pizza used to have the best slice until this pizzeria opened up .
But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere , delightfully free of the BTs .
We concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake , both were delicious .
The crowd was older and the restaurant is very cramped , but it has old school charm .
I am surprised at the lower reviews because it is definitely better than other places I have tried with higher ratings .
Even if the food was n't this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax .
Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting .
A nice space , as long as it does n't get too crowded and a singleminded devotion to its chosen cuisine make Mare a great choice for seafood lovers .
Not impressed with the food .
I recommend the jelly fish , drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings , certainly the stir fry blue crab .
Maybe it was the great company ( I had friends visiting from Philly – yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but I just ca n’t say enough good things about this brasserie .
The service was dreadfully slow ( the place was only half full ) and a smile would have been nice ...
They have authentic Indian at amazin prices .
20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our surroundings and each other .
Great bagels made the old-fashioned way .
It will be on my to do list the next visit to NYC .
And it was quick which is very important .
It 's just average , just shredded , no seasoning on it .
I can not imagine better Indian food in all of the city .
Murray wo n't do it .
I have been to Roth 's twice and both times were very disappointing .
My boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque .
I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere that whisks you away to the left bank of the river Seine .
Try the lasagnette appetizer .
Three page wine menu , one page entree and horedevous .
An awesome organic dog , and a conscious eco friendly establishment .
I have been to Mary 's many times and I like it .
Try everything for that matter , it is all good .
My GF and I still choose to eat there a lot because of diverse cocktails , the chill decor , and the decent sushi .
I felt as though I were eating in Paris .
The tastes makes your mouth water for more .
it 's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food .
As many other reviewers noticed , your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time .
The decoration was feeling like we was on the Cairo , actually the street is part of that adventure .
Also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ .
This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn .
It is not worth for that bucks .
Are you freaking kidding me ?
Great sushi experience .
The ambience was nice , but service was n't so great .
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty ( could 've used a bit more salt ) .
Drawbacks : service is slow and they do n't toast !
Beautiful experience .
Way below average
Frankly , the chinese food here is something I can make better at home .
Even though I made the reservation at 3pm for the same night through Dinnerbroker , we were seated at a table with one of the best view !
It is quite a spectacular scene i 'll give them that .
The bar drinks were Eh , ok to say the least .
It is so romantic .
Go spend your money somewhere that really wows you .
However , the service is absolutely horrible .
You should pass on the calamari .
This place is so much fun .
I believe there were 2 shrimp in the " salt encrusted shrimp " appetizer .
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .
Off the beaten path , this jewel of a restaurant shines just one block away from the plethora of 6th street Indian restaurants .
I have enjoyed everything I have ever gotten and the fish is so fresh and always prepared in a great way .
We 've lived in the area for more than 8 years .
The rolls are creative and I have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious japanese food .
Come on .
Everytime my husband and I go there , we are never disappointed .
The Thali was small , thoroughly unremarkable , and $ 14.95 .
Reasonably priced with very fresh sushi .
The place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious .
I like Mamoun 's food as well , but side by side , Kati Rolls just produce tastier food hands down .
The food 's as good as ever .
BEST DINING EXPERIENCE IN THE WEST VILLAGE !
The pizza was pretty good and huge .
Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS !
my picks are : - Scallion Pancake ( fried with vegetable juice , very special and tasty ) - Guizhou Chicken - Shredded Squid Family Style ( one of my personal favorites ) - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab - Shuizhu Fish ( this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans , I would n't recommend to my American friends as it 's very spicy .
Tried the pad see ew on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it 's one of my favorite dishes .
He served me an Uni Hand roll , which I never had before , and let me tell you ... IT WAS HEAVEN !
You will find yourself returning quite often .
I liked the beer selection !
Dip the ingredients in with your chopsticks , swirl them around , and eat .
Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .
Conveniently located too , being right on Bedford ave.
We have never had any problems with charging the meal or the tip , and the food was delivered quickly , but we live only a few minutes walk from them .
The place is beautiful !
Over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals .
They smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone .
From the moment you enter till the moment you walk out the friendly and helpful staff was was just Fantastic .
The owner and staff go to great lengths to make you feel comfortable .
Wonderful at holiday time .
But I 'd go back
I drop more dollar bills here than your uncle after a weekend at Scores .
None of that yucky whipped stuff .
We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great !
The place has a nice fit-out , some attractive furnishings and , from what I could tell , a reasonable wine list ( I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins )
Similar to other Indian restaurants , they use the dinner special to attract customers at the door .
I definitely enjoyed the food as well .
Going to Volare is like going to your favorite aunt 's house for dinner , assuming that your aunt is a great Italian cook .
The entire place and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt .
Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all .
It is sometimes a little cramped , and can get a little warm , but hello , it 's NYC !
This is the kind of place you 'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret .
Slightly above average wines start at $ 70 + with only one selection listed at $ 30 + .
Granted the space is smaller than most , it is the best service you will find in even the largest of restaurants .
The new menu has a few creative items , they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites ( but they raised the prices ) , the staff is friendly most of the time , but I must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words : No , ca n't , sorry ... , boy , they wo n't bend the rules for anyone .
A must for all the Dosa lovers .
The pastas are incredible , the risottos ( particularly the sepia ) are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing .
since i was in the neighborhood , we made sure to give this a try .
Always a nice crowd , but never loud .
The pesto pizza was excellent , thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I 'd never heard of before .
Please save yourself the frustration .
I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED !
Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service , which was boarderline rude .
Haru on Park S is simply disgusting .
I 've been to Sotto Voce several time , and I have to say this one place that hits the nail right on the head ever time !
Seating is ok even though sometimes there 's alot of people .
I could n't reccommend their Godmother pizza any higher .
The staff should be a bit more friendly .
noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST !
My friend from Milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian .
I have known about this secret for the last 13 years , Emilio ( the Godfather ) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices .
my personal favorite is an everything bagel with lox spread , but all the bagles are unbeliavably good .
It 's just O.K. pizza .
The food is great , I love their dumplings , cold sesame noodles , chicken and shrimp dishs .
On our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table .
In addition to great hot dogs , DOTP has wonderful breakfast sandwiches that feature , in addition to great things like tator tots and English muffins , a delicious NJ-based pork product know to us Jersey girls and boys as Taylor ham .
The high prices you 're going to pay is for the view not for the food .
I look forward to eating here again
Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best , freshly baked bread !
We paid and left because we did n't feel like arguing any more .
I 'm sure I 'll return for a final judgement tho .
Moving on .
The dishes offered were unique , very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages , sardines with biscuits , large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream ( the best and freshest I 've ever had ) .
Stay away from this place .
The first 2 courses were very good , but the chocolate sampler was too rich for me and the dessert wine far too sweet .
This is a fun restaurant to go to .
A glass of Leaping Lizard , a glass of prosecco , and the mussels had everything happy .
The waitress came by to pick up the soy sauce WHILE we were eating our lunch !!!!!
Very popular style Izakaya ( Sake and small portion of sake-friendly dishes ) .
They treat me like family , morning and night .
The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out .
Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away .
love the food .
Authentic Shanghai style and I can not recommend a better Shanghai place in New York .
Great neighborhood joint .
My friends and I showed up on a Sat .
Good to find a restaurant where the owners have some imagination and they have actually pulled it off , like in this case .
My goodness , everything from the fish to the rice to the seaweed was absolutely amazing .
I had very high expectations for this place and made a reservation a couple of months in advance for a special occasion .
I will be returning .
Did I mention the wine ?
Ravioli was good ... but I have to say that I found everything a bit overpriced .
The atmosphere is unheralded , the service impecible , and the food magnificant .
Go to Volare for 1st class service and terrific food .
The food was delicious and clearly fresh ingredients were used .
Wretched and retching
The main entree was also very good .
The waitstaff were attentive , polite and helpful - an impressive feat in such close quarters .
Sometimes tables do n't understand his sense of humor but it 's refreshing to have a server who has personality , professionalism , and respects the privacy of your dinner .
The food now is inconsistent .
The food is uniformly exceptional , with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating , whether it 's on the menu or not .
Try it !
La Rosa waltzes in , and I think they are doing it the best .
Terrible would be a compliment !
I have been there many times , and food is good and consistent .
Compared to Ess-a , Tal offers a less doughy bagel !
I would definitely go back for a very special occasion , but not for regular fine dining .
Go girls !!!
I WAS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED BY THE FOOD .
As a Japanese native , I 've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years , but I was just so amazed at this place .
Our teenage kids love it , too .
Reliable , Fresh Sushi
You can do it here .
Joya used to be a cool spot with decent food and a colorful - if not relaxed - atmosphere .
The wine list is extensive and impressive .
If you like seafood and/or Greek food you will love this place though it is not limited to just these things .
The service is fantastic .
To top it all off . . the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant .
We had half/half pizza , mine was eggplant and my friend had the buffalo and it was sooo huge for a small size pizza !
and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs .
We were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks .
Also , I personally was n't a fan of the portobello and asparagus mole .
All the desserts the group tried got favorable reviews .
I was on jury duty , rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome chicken tacos and Hibiscus lemonade .
The menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent .
The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions .
THIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED .
The pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap , frozen , shredded cheese common to most pizzaria 's .
I would like to return and try some of the other menu items when I do n't have to rush off to a show .
it 's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food .
Well , this place is so Ghetto its not even funny .
This place blew me away ... by far my new favorite restaurant on the uppereast side .
Ive been to many Thai restaurants in Manhattan before , and Toons is by far the best Thai food Ive had ( except for my mom 's of course ) .
But the coconut rice was good .
Went to Village last night for my birthday .
I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one .
We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the wait for a table .
The servers give you some sample slices of your order while you wait ( shortly I might add ) .
Indoor was very cozy and cute .
Good bagels and good cream cheese .
My family and I ate here last night for our annual Christmas dinner with the family members who would rather spend the holidays with friends out-of-town .
at taj , vegetarians can rejoice-all the dishes are manna from heaven .
My girlfiends and I ate at O.G. again last night .
The wine the service was very good too .
Just make sure my ice water is kept full and my tea kettle filled with piping hot tea and that 's all the service I need ...
I have taken practically every guest that has come to visit me in NY and hooked a few New Yorkers onto Peep as well .
my wife and i have been going to nyc for years and would n't miss roxy , s food is expensive but it 's new york !
If you are looking for a good quality , cheap eats - this is the place .
I 'll being with a couple of positives : cool decor , good pita and hummus , and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty .
You fellas above says its the best Taiwanese restaurant in town .
After dinner I heard music playing and discovered that there is a lounge downstairs .
I complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted .
They do n't walk around with the trays of Dim Sum .
There restaurant is very casual , but perfect for lunch , and their delivery service is always very fast .
He offers subpar service and has no personality .
Innovations are just as assured , from the simple Carinthia cheese ravioli with wild mushrooms to the caviar-topped sturgeon , beautifully matched with a bright green spinach-vodka sauce .
Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon , Sea Bass and Crispy Duck .
Being a vegan myself , I 've made a point of trying all the vegan restaurants in Manhattan -- and Zen Palate is easily my favorite .
have always had a great time here .
The view is breathtaking the service is top notch ... the ambiance is wonderfull .
But , they were too big for the bun .
We shared a bottle of sake , an order of edamames , and she had the sushi plate while I had the sashimi .
I had fish and my husband had the filet - both of which exceeded our expectations .
The wine list is n't great , and the desserts are shipped in from Bruno 's down the street , which is not as good as it used to be .
Food is great .
Quick and friendly service .
Look elsewhere .
I 've been many time and have never been disappointed .
P.S. Please do n't tell anyone in my family i eat there .
You can do it here .
The menu is fairly simple without much descriptions .
Again , if you are in this neighborhood - by all means , come here .
Nice value .
The food is consistently wonderful - I 've been coming here for years , and the owner has always been accomodating and friendly .
My husband and I ate here after reading reviews here as well as hobokeni.com ,
I ca n't wait for the nex time .
One special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up , but save room for dessert !
Oh , but wait , we were out of drinks ( which were also delightfully overpriced ) .
The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive .
I really recommend the very simple Unda ( Egg ) rolls .
For some reason , all the seafood on the menu was unavailable except for the Salmon .
Last time I went here , the waitress did n't come back after taking our order .
Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available .
I paid just about $ 60 for a good meal , though : )
I 've never been treated so rudely .
Really cool stauff inside .
Of course , it is crowded but who cares .
We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it .
Feels like family when we go there .
A restaurant that does n't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere .
By far , the best pizza in Manhattan .
Was there Friday night .
For all you lazy folks that do n't want to come to Alphabet City , I say , good - stay out .
Try green curry with vegetables .
Because we did n't have a reservation , we could only sit in the back garden , but it was great , secluded and perfect in nice weather .
Despite the 5th ave address there are no frills whick I also love .
I went to Swiftys with some friends of the family and we had a very nice dinner , but nothing amazing .
i 've noticed megadeth , mr. scruff , st. germain , traditional vietnamese songs , black sabbath , jay-z , and daft punk all being played .
Yakitori ( bbq meats ) is tasty too .
I discovered Applebees when I went away to college in VA .
This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it .
Fluke sashimi drizzled with jalapeno-lime olive oil , the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish 's sweetness .
In any event , this is a place I 'll be sure to stop by again when I 'm in this part of town .
Not pretentious and very economical .
Tends to turn people away .
Our waiter was friendly and it is a shame that he didnt have a supportive staff to work with .
Go hungry and enjoy .
This place must have cost the owners afortune to build .
But the main hit was the whole grilled fish .
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date .
The octopus eaters were floored by the Octopus salad .
When I saw that their website had a link to da Ciro in Napoli , I knew there was going to be good pizza !
But dinner here is never disappointing , even if the prices are a bit over the top .
Has the chef and owner changed ???
The place is clean , and if you like soul food , then this is the place to be !
I HATE HATE HATE this place .
The food is reliable and the price is moderate .
Overall , excellent restaurant !
The food has been consistant for years and it never lets you down .
The place 's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh .
Nice Family owned traditional restaurant .
Three of us arrived for dinner about 5:30 on a week night without reservations .
Over the years , it has always provided a pleasurable dining experience with quality food and wine .
Located at the end of a magnificent block .
I stopped by for some brunch today and had the vegan cranberry pancakes and some rice milk .
The best pad thai i 've ever had .
A plus was the good mix of people in their twenties that provided for great eye-candy while I was there .
Great sushi experience .
What for ?
This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls .
Just want to warn you all - do n't waste your time and money .
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose .
The chicken pot pie is excpetiona , the cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm .
I 've been to Naples 45 for dinner twice .
It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant , with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender , but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere .
Prices even outside of restaurant week were great .
I 've been eating at Taj Mahal for over twenty years and have found them to be the most excellent of the Indian eateries on this block of Indian restaurants .
The second you walk through the heavy vault like door , with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime .
jazz singer had a nice voice + she made us all get up to dance to shake some cals to eat some more .
The BEST Chinese food Uptown !
Hurley 's is like Cheers where everyone knows your name and they are ACTUALLY glad you came .
The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed .
Yes , they 're a bit more expensive then typical , but then again , so is their food .
It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine .
The chicken dinner was real good .
Cute place , nice wait staff but would never go there again .
Got a little loud after 8pm when the joint got full .
After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner .
The folding chair I was seated at was uncomfortable .
You ca n't say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown .
I love this place more and more everytime i go .
Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood .
It is also extremely well priced .
A Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner ?
the wait staff is very friendly , if your not rude or picky ....... our meal at Leon last weekend was great - .
This will be only the third online review I have ever made about a restaurant in my life .
We were a group of 8 and well seved .
We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order .
Also , the place is popular with families , so if you 're bothered by children running loose like wild animals , come later at night to avoid them .
LOVE the atmosphere - felt like I was in Paris .
The lox is always fresh too .
Only drawback - they wo n't toast your bagel , and they do n't make eggs for the bagel .
Finally , I got sick of the bad service , obnoxious smirks , and snotty back talk .
honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives .
The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great .
Get it together .
Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most .
please do n't fool us .
Everything a NY pizza joint should be .
This place started off a little iffy , but is now one of my favorite indian restaurants in NYC ( and I 'm indian , so I should know ) .
The crust is thin , the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly .
The menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked .
from an English speaking staff .
Eating at Ottimo is like eating in Chef Salvatore Esposito 's home .
Went to Cafe Spice with 4 of my friends on a saturday night .
The dim sum is ok but does n't taste that fresh , and the little dishes do n't look steamy hot as they should ( also note lack of Chinese here ) .
This is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the Basil slice .
Service was also very good .
All I can say is WOW !
This is the first place I 've been that a runner remembers my order ... hope he likes his job because I have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant .
We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu .
Service was good and so was the atmosphere .
The service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served .
This is my fourth try over a two year period , and I 'm done .
then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi .
less wait time for me !
This was the worst dining experience I 've ever had .
THR AT MOSHPHERE IS COMPACT , MODERN , YET COZY .
Also , do n't plan on asking for your favorite roll , if it 's not on the menu , you ca n't have it .
I am so coming back here again , as much as I can .
The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu , present your meal , and attend to your needs .
quacamole at pacifico is yummy , as are the wings with chimmichuri .
word of advice , save room for pasta dishes and never leave until you 've had the tiramisu .
The specials are usually quite good too .
Some of the finest latin women you 'll see in your life hang out at Jimmy 's .
Service was very friendly .
A word to the wise - the Hoboken health inspector clued me to his findings that this is THE cleanest restaurant in town .
the restaurant was completely empty , but she gave me a dirty look and asked , no reservations ?
Once you step into Cosette , you 're miraculously in a small , off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro .
This place has the best pizza .
I absolutely suggest this place .
Acceptable prices .
The price very reasonable .
First of all , this place is * not * romantic , as claimed by Citysearch 's editorial review .
May , the owner always has a smile on her and will warmly greet you .
The sauces used are also not that exciting .
The food was exceptional .
At 5 dumplings for $ 1 , you just can not go wrong .
Did n't seem like any effort was made to the display and quality of the food .
They also have a back garden open in the summer - cute and French with outdoor seating - what more could you ask for ?
The restuarant itself is not large , but seems to have several round tables to accomodate large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic Taiwanese .
The food was delicious and the waiter was incredibly helpful and attentive ( considering we were the only ones there for the first hour ) .
I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks !
Highly recommended !
If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines , please check their wine list .
It appears to be the owner 's first venture and it shows .
No gimmicks here -- the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation .
At this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the waitress WALKED away .
The food is average : breakfast food , soups , salads , sandwiches , etc .
We ordered the special , grilled branzino , that was so infused with bone , it was difficult to eat .
Whenever you need a Sushi fix , Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service .
The place just is n't ready for prime time .
Our son loves pizza and we have a certified Neapolitan pizzaria in our home city ( Seattle ) , we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant .
Pick a bagel has the best bagels in the city .
Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them .
Molto bene !
This is the perfect date spot for Williamsburg couples .
It 's constantly open , catering to the Pakistani cabbies lined up on Crosby St. , so there 's more turnover with the food than you 'd expect ( i.e. , surprisingly fresh ) .
The bill is approximately $ 25 for 2 at lunch without drinks .
El Nidos one of the best restaurants in New York which I 've ever been to , has a great variety of tasty , mouth watering pizza 's .
It is a small restuarant so go early and it will be nice and quiet - go late and it will be packed !
All of my co-workers stated that the food was amazing and wondered why they had n't heard about this place .
i recommend the thai popcorn : )
This big draw is the all you can sushi here for $ 19.95 !
The staff is excellent , specjal : that girl behind the bar , european chic .
As we were leaving , the couple standing by the door said to another waiter , we 're not in a hurry .
Our favorite meal is a pesto pizza , the house salad , and a good bottle of wine .
When I called this morning , I did n't think I would be able to get in at 12 , but I was able to get in , along with four other guests .
The people with carts of food do n't understand you because they do n't speak English , their job is to give you the delicious food you point at .
The menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them .
The cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan .
Fine , I wont hang you for that .
A coworker and I tried Pacifico after work a few Fridays and loved it .
You will find everything about Trio to your liking !
Anyhow , we were able to sit as long as we wanted and chat , which was nice .
What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka . . some of which we never received !
First of all Dal Bukhara Rocks .
The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic , just simple , small and sparse .
They have it all -- great price , food , and service .
Would recommend this place as a good date spot if you do n't want to drop a ton of cash .
The service is great , my soup always arrives nice and hot .
Ca n't wait to go back .
Not what I wanted to hear .
It is not a place for tourists or someone who has never dined in Bay Ridge .
Definitely Highly NOT recommended .
From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I ca n't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing .
The food was very well prepared .
To me it exemplifies Soho , cute , artsy , interesting .
OK , I 've been to Dumont a few times now .
Our server was very helpful and friendly .
After so many great reviews here , my bf and I went to Esca to celebrate my birthday last nite .
The service is outstanding and my crab-cake eggs benedict could not have been better .
I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan .
I went to pams with my girlfriend , and i love it .
We saw them heating up at least one frozen item though I 'm not sure which dim sum dish it was .
Go here .
A great addition to Smith Street : finally , a place that 's not pretentious and filled with women wearing Ugg boots .
Yes , they use fancy ingredients , but even fancy ingredients do n't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .
The food was outstanding and the service was tops .
just walk by the window and see all the unbiased positive reviews in all the major nyc publications .
The white bean brushetta to start was incredible and the pasta was phenomenal .
The wait staff was loud and inconsiderate .
Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there .
Its dark , and cozy . . there is always jazz music playing when we go .
It 's easy to get a table for a large group and you do n't get hustled out .
The main downside to the place is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level .
She lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy .
Definitely a once a year treat that I look forward to around the holidays !
I need at least three rolls to be full , and that 's at least $ 14.00 !
I 've been to this monster sushi twice , the 46th st once , the 23rd st one a number of times .
Threw my fiance 's surprise 30th birthday dinner here could n't be happier .
Even better , they know how to cook French classics like Steak au Poivre and Onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it .
On that scale , it 's a world-beater .
Everything on the menu is great .
The signs , the specials menus , food , and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese .
This place is classy , chic , the service is warm and hospitable , and the food is outstanding .
The staff greeted me warmly at the door and I was seated promptly and the food was excellent .
Host and Hostess was quite rude .
The food was amazing , and the service was prompt and helpful , but not over-bearing or rushed .
I also recommend the garlic knots .
Well ... they can run but they ca n't hide .
We go on Mondays for the prix fixe and our experience with the food has been comparable to Blue Ribbon .
No plans to return anytime soon .
This place is so much fun .
The food is good , especially their more basic dishes , and the drinks are delicious .
Village is one of those places that scores on all fronts .
It gets crowded at lunchtime but there are lots of seats in back and everyone who works there is so nice .
rice dishes and noodle dishes rarely exceed $ 5 and add on a refreshing ice drink for $ 2 and you 're set for the night !
I think this is one of the more underrated places in the city .
Visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews .
Ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me .
it helps if you know what to order .
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .
Our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese .
The pasta was well cooked , did n't have enough sauce though or flavor .
My wife and I went to Orsay for Valentine 's dinner .
Awesome
Since it literally is a complete hole in the wall , it 's a bit intimidating at first , but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you - do n't hesitate to ask for help with what to get .
The food is just OKAY , and it 's almost not worth going unless you 're getting the pialla , which is the only dish that 's really good .
The menu , which changes seasonally , shows both regional and international influences .
Just ignore the trendy wannabes .
Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed , however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance .
The service is descent even when this small place is packed .
I 've had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times , when I have been in the neighborhood .
Pizza is terrific , as is homemade pasta .
Especially liked chicken tikka and the naan , and the dals .
Everyone who works there ( the host , the bartender , the servers ) is so helpful .
We did tip , I guess the model/waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager .
The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful .
Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner .
Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant .
The food always tastes fresh and served promptly .
Horrible food and Horrible service .
They are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in Yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey .
Looking around , I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen .
Great staff .
With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored .
And I 've been to many NYC delis .
I do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy .
While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance , and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City , the food was not what I had hoped for .
Service ok but unfriendly , filthy bathroom .
We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful .
I recently visited over this past summer after being away for a year .
There is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times .
A bit breezy up there on the mezzanine from the wind coming from the tracks .
The space is traditional in feel .
This is a true gem of the village .
Service was warm and attentive , beef carpaachio was exellent ( huge portion ) and pasta was fresh and well-prepared .
What more could you want ?
If you were there when it first opened , give this restaurant a second chance .
They have great rolls , the triple color and norwegetan rolls , are awesome and filling .
For me dishes a little oily , but overall dining experience good .
On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch .
The staff is accomodating , the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed , and the food is out of this world !
I 'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service .
The crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components .
Delivery guy sometimes get upset if you do n't tip more than 10 % .
I wo n't go back unless someone else is footing the bill .
Beef noodle soup is good as well .
I lived in Maine for ten years and grew up on fish .
The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it .
The portions are now very small , the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .
My husband and I have been there at least 6 times and we 've always been given the highest service and often free desserts .
Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids .
How have I never been to Agave before ?
To be fair , the food still is good and the service is quick and attentative even though its usually very busy .
We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it .
And even with it 's Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too !
To my right , the hostess stood over a busboy and hissed rapido , rapido as he tried to clear and re-set a table for six .
We were fans of the half-price Saturday night option until some inedible squid during a recent visit .
We wo n't go to this place again for a good meal .
Better than the bagel shop on the corner , but not worth going out of your way for , in my opinion .
Food was decent , but not great .
We paid a fixed pricce but got nothing !!
The bagels always warm , soft on the inside , crispy on the outside and enormous in size .
Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months .
We were pleasantly greeted .
This is definitely a place that provides the best experience , though , to both A-listers and people walking in off the street .
