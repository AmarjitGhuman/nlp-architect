everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .
whereas some folks have the " ipod " , i have the " nomad jukebox zen xtra " ( not to be confused with the " nomad jukebox zen nx " ) .
hope to get my refund in a timely manner .
the higher the number the better the quality ( less data compression is used ) and the larger the file size .
it wo n't play all of my movies .
i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .
the warranty is 90 days .
the player : it 's silver .
with the nomad explorer software , songs should be drag-and-drop .
awesome feature .
my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .
excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players .
ipod can be used as an external disk , and apparently stores files without problem .
i made the mistake of thinking i could easily manage my mp3 library with this device .
you can 't simply open up a folder from the player and play all the songs in it .
working for 10 hours with it on " shuffle " totally rocks ! !
no matter the format .
you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .
the lcd screen was very large and readable .
now honestly , i love this player , but with all seriousness , i would not recommend it to other people , because of the breakdown flaw. and i honestly would not recomment the people of the ipod , that crap sucks big donkey ..... never mind .
- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .
this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .
the phones are awesome .
i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .
the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .
despite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic , i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually .
the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .
they piggy-back on cingular 's service .
* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ).
- outstanding signal reception
the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .
the second one is up and running .
what task do they perform ?
this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .
the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that " creates " folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .
i upgraded to a 6610 at my local t-mobile store .
this is pretty cool .
removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .
i 'd like to see how well a small company supports its mp3 player in 2 years when its battery dies as all rechargeable do .
it is connected to an old television set via composite video and analog audio outputs .
one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched !
4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
got a " system error " problem 30 days after purchase .
i liked this one enough to buy another .
word ... peace in the east bruvah .
3 ) you must press the play button and hold it for a couple of seconds otherwise it will not work and you will think the whole unit is broken .
the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car .
if you can live without an integrated camera , you wo n't miss much more .
i 'd have given it 5 stars , but i 'm waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one :
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .
looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .
the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .
so it was no loss .
unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box .
the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .
i hope i have helped you continue to enjoy the apex dvd player with these troubleshooting tips .
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial . its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )
1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .
this camera will stay with me for years !
as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .
i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time .
anyway , im gon na go find dennis now , have a nice day ! ! !
get one now !
also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore " the " when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .
the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use .
i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit .
i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .
player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 .
weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] .
this required patience as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it ( which i could do with my flash player ) .
about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .
after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive , so better organization is required .
the player controls are too easy to hit accidentally .
i love my new nomad , its great !
i do n't think so .
this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .
highly recommended .
also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .
i am not talking milliseconds .
some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .
it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .
1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , " dad ! somethings wrong with the dvd player ! come quick ! "
it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working .
autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .
so how can i do that ... are n't that free for two after the rebates .
i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering .
this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .
i did n't even try the included software .
unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks .
also have had it lock up when i shut it down to attend to a phone call .
it referred to a " microsoft jet database engine " error and the install program suggested i download a service pack from the ms website to fix the problem ;
i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .
- included creative software is pretty poor .
i shopped around for a while before buying a hard-drive mp3 player .
this one was rated very high by several people check out this site and epinions.com .
i currently have ~ 1100 songs encoded mostly at 196 kpbs and i have n't even used 10gb of storage yet .
after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !
the ad-1600 did n't work corectly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up .
another point of note : the battery life is incredible !
the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .
this is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to " easy listening " rather than " heavy metal " - no problem .
very bad quality .
i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control .
like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product .
for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style .
it 'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it .
after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures .
the reason it does not get 5 stars
come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones .
the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did .
rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .
i got it now , and i 'm diggin ' it .
it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches .
compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use .
i am even a bit technology oriented , so i thought it would be a breeze to set this up .
called customer service and basically was told to either keep buying univ. remotes to try or buy the replacement remote for $ 23 ( which is almost half of what i paid for the whole player ) .
but there are certain issues might be they are to me here - all of them are minor; not major ones though ,
one bad thing though , i find the remote control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does .
i am using musicmatch to rip & catalog ( and if i choose , download ) music ;
the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .
based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal .
after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .
i had downloaded about 1000 songs and had room for another 9000 !
simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !
as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .
i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy .
the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones .
the ipod also does not let you see what 's coming up next on the player .
do too many stuffs to get to a free phone after rebate .
maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .
the price compared to the ipod is great .
even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .
anyway , on with the review .
i will never go back to my archos again ! !
it lasts , truly , 7 days on standby .
this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !
so now i 've got to call their customer " service " ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back .
a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .
great price .
the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .
so i had to give up and return it , having lost about 4 hours .
the sound quality is very good .
but you do n't have to be .
i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) .
other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .
great camera .
i love this camera .
the light goes from red to green but no display or any operation whatsoever .
that way i could get rid of a walkman alltogether .
buy an extra battery - life is good but still somewhat short .
i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out .
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price .
the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day ( although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life ) .
having to copy / delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage .
for me , i 'll save that cash for another purchase .
the phone may look large but it is very small smaller then the 3390 phone .
you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
for `` cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does n't have any wow factor .
what a disappointment !
subsequent behavior even worse .
it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims .
only used for 3 month before it 's down !
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .
i was watching pirates of the caribbean and decided to watch the extras disc .
because of this , i am disappointed and would not recommend this product .
four megapixels is great .
of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents .
after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available .
possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .
my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again .
that makes sense though , with all the substandard products they make .
great screen and great sound .
it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice .
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .
i ordered this player for christmas , and so far i have it for only 2 weeks .
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did .
a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .
the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .
the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .
i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at .
it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .
4 ) a set of speakers and a wireless transmitter are accessories that will add to your player 's usability ( the latter will allow you to play it on your car radio , home receiver , etc. )
i have no complaints with this mp3 player .
i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .
ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1.1 usb ) .
first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .
the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .
100 % perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos .
you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck
i have n't figured it out yet .
i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move .
the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .
i do n't have a dvd + r to try
this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .
one of the calls was on a saturday and when i pressed the guy a bit , he said , " actually we do n't ship on saturdays " .
although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent .
however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .
many of our disney movies do n't play on this dvd player .
if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty .
as some other reviewers noted , after it was connected to the computer for a bit , it somehow stopped reading the player so i had to replug it .
i was n't sure how long it would take before it would break .
a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film .
it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .
want the laundry list of reasons why ?
it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video .
the included memory card is too small .
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player .
( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . )
the player kept displaying " no disc " , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * !
i suppose that you could jog with it but it seems to be made for the enjoyment of music .
i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .
reason for two ?
lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .
that is a major minus , but its not that bad .
with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more .
the reason for this the ipod has " a better user interface " .
i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .
the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .
ok this is our first dvd player so what do i know .
i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .
overall i like the unit .
accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .
the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me .
if you do n't have a gray card , you can use a plain white piece of paper .
as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .
1 ) a spare battery would have been great .
i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player .
however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .
worse of all , they claim that it 's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty !
i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery , so it 's good to go on a long vacation .
you need your computer , however , if you want to add tracks to a playlist .
please go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story .
but it works perfectly fine on my parent 's computer .
despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. .
the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .
it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files .
notmad worked right away after install and it is what i would like to see from the product .
this camera performs like i can not believe !
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .
a great deal in general !
and should they not know it , they can find it out pretty quick .
i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .
however , i do n't know the dvd 's performance on a heavy load of every-day viewing .
now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it !
i am returning mine for a replacement , but if i receive another ad-2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund , but never buy another apex product in the future .
easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this
so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .
besides user error ( surprise , surprise ) , it 's hard to imagine people having trouble with either .
the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone " unlike the nokia 3650 " and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make ...
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !
now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk .
yet they 've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone , including italian , german , and dutch .
i have not yet tried the photo show capability , but i 'm thinking that will probably work well too , based on the success with the above mentioned disks .
within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob .
first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .
i 'm live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators .
* lens visible in optical viewfinder .
video output stopped workin .
no complaints there .
the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it .
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
look / design :
this seemed like a really good compromise .
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had .
the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's .
this is a powerful piece of equipment .
i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .
i was , however .
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed !
purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it .
for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised .
i 'll have to borrow cd 's to rip from friends to even come close to filling the thing .
so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos .
i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience .
it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .
3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .
for example , jimi hendrix 's 2 cd live at the fillmore east had one cd classifed as classic rock and the other psychidelic rock .
the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .
this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .
hope i helped !
i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago .
the phone does have voice dialing according to amazon & t-mobile and nokia .
if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later .
the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful .
most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy .
3 . it 's a hazard in the car .
i changed video cables , tried connecting to tv on input1 and input2 but no help .
i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone .
a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models .
once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers .
bottom line for me is that for the price i do n't think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player .
the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .
their website does not show it as a compatible phone , and should i try to access the game downloads on t-zones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported .
when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .
you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player .
unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds. even though they were not damaged in any way .
i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile .
it 's nothing major , just a bad hard drive , any hard drive mp3 player can have that problem .
the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures .
you have to ask yourself , " how much money is dissapointment worth ? "
the nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six .
- bright , visible screen
the moveable lcd screen is great .
do n't get me wrong , the thing was like heaven for about a week .
do n't be pulled in by the great price -- you get what you pay for , and there 's a reason this model is so cheap .
only one disk played through to completion successfully .
when plugged in , it does n't lag the computer like the archos did ... unless you are doing a massive transfer of data in one load .
i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way .
the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .
i guess i 'm just lucky to get a good working unit !
of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest .
it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates .
the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .
although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .
i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb .
i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .
but this camera is great !
contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .
if you have the appetite choose the one that you think has the least deficiencies or is best suited to you .
but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on it have a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments .
tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .
it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
many people recommended the ipod , and i borrowed one from a friend .
3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .
i 'd like to see my old carrier do that !
i have not used the progressive scan feature .
i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it .
i had hoped this was bought from walmart so that i could return it !
the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
then you can say , " my dissapointment only cost $ 39 . "
it took maybe 15 minutes to transfer 1000 songs .
apex sucks !
and then you will start to belive them .
this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
or save time and just do it , you wo n't regret it .
i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient .
i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .
the only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow , leading to longer delays in some functions ( playback and even a slow display of the menu ? ) .
you can also search for your song , which is good .
yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .
in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !
i purchased the phone last week and have been using till then . .
i bought this to replace an expensive ( $ 300 + ) onkyo dvd player that quit after only 3 years !
navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .
now i know better .
bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent .
5 for " digital film " it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome .
however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures .
of course you do !
you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do .
longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .
and does n't need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does .
after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all .
when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .
you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though .
thought i 'd weigh in here with my stats .
the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .
overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver .
that 's my only real complaint about the nomad zen xtra , though .
i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones .
the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .
the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings .
i 'm starting to listen to cd 's that i have n't listened to in years now that i have them all handy in one place .
unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd .
people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant .
good thing i got a replacement plan .
is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel .
i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes .
audio is excellent .
do n't drop this unit :
i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. .
i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .
strike 1 .
when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken - the motor would not eject discs or close the door .
also , if you 're an audiophile , you 'll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short .
software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .
and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem .
the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )
it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .
the powershot g3 is a great camera .
i love this player .
the storage capacity is great for me --
2 ) buy a good pair of head-phones unless you already own one .
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing .
let 's face it - when you want to watch a movie you want to see a picture .
even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
30gb is more than enough for most people .
4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed .
so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .
is it a coincidence that i no longer can get any of your nomad zen xtras ( worst name ever ) at best buy and now the 60gb nomad xtra is " sold out " or more likely " discontinued " at the almighty amazon.com ?
i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures .
. go ; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card .
i chose the canon speedlite 420 .
the title says it all ...
whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox , it dumps all of them into a single folder , and then sorts them by the id3 tags.
it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy .
and have you seen the price of the ipod extras that you need .
if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .
within 5 minutes i was able to transfer files .
minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable .
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .
use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run .
1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .
for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .
i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time .
case - the nomad comes with a leather holding case .
when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .
the storage capacity is great .
i would recommend this product to anyone .
i will never use all the " whistles and bells " this machine is capable of .
it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .
for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience .
they sell an adapter unit to use with your car 's cassette deck .
i called them twice and both times they said it is " about to ship " .
anyone looking for more than " point and shoot " can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .
b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .
who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will .
the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual .
otherwise , this player is awesome !
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year " no questions asked " replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !
i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year .
ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras .
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :
i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever .
a tons of reveiws has reported this problem and the same here .
they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .
interface - practically seamless .
i bought this camera because it fit my budget and the pre-production and production model reviews were positive .
it costs like 200 dollars to replace - now you mail it off to get the battery replaced for like 99 .. .
the software you get with this camera is perfect .
this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi .
i have owned an apex ad-3201 for close to 3 years now and i love that deck .
the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .
no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad .
you have to add all the songs to a play list .
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .
fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
otherwise , you 'll have to mess around a lot with filenames inside the ( decent ) nomad explorer , which is not fun at all .
the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .
anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 .
i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :
making the step from film to digital has been a great move .
this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags , and if you 've downloaded your songs off the internet , many probably do n't .
my next thought was that the dvd must be damaged .
this thing kicks mighty apple butt !
what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .
i spent $ 269 for my 30gb zx , compared to the $ 299 for a 10gb ipod and the also expensive iriver ihp-120 .
actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated .
it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something .
this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .
but you might find my review useful , nonetheless .
the software will convert your cd 's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to .
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy .
basically wat happened , is that the hard drive failed .
there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev. machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance .
8mb for a camera like this is a joke .
anyway , the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago - you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product .
and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey !
the included earbuds were uncomfortable .uncomfortable -1
so i do n't understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them .
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?
the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .
now i know why - they are pieces of junk .
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon .
i ordered two of these puppies for christmas gifts .
all in all suprisingly easy to use .
the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .
it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .
the files are there , but i could not access the player without removing the battery , waiting a short period and re-inserting the battery .
software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better , but costs money )
when talking the voice is not very clear .
it 's a very intuitive program .
i end up unplugging it from the wall for a few hours and when i try again it will work fine.at least until this problem arises again .
i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs , which is an unaccustomed luxury , even with t-mobile service .
whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .
sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much .
i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive .
my opinions :
the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .
( this includes the $ 20 that you have to pay up front , just to get them to look at your player . )
i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase .
it also lets you remove songs from the play order .
i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product .
like other reviewers , installation was hell .
i 'm editing my review , because now i wish i read the manual before returning the player i bought for my girlfriend .
the light auto-correction is awesome .
i will just say this :
my sister was able to figure it out on her own as well , and she is of average computer competence .
after installing it and trying to make it working for 30 minutes i went and bought notmad .
the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .
yes it is 56k speed , but the functionality is what you are paying for .
i got this player for christmas & this was my first time using an mp3 player .
have used it frequently and have had no problems .
there are not a lot of good options out there .
i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .
i refused to go for an ipod , i am not going to spend all that money just for the apple name and because it is " trendy " to have that player .
i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .
i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed .
for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player .
i set the camera to the " manual " mode for one main reason :
i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models .
finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .
this is not the same thing as a film camera .
it plays everything , even vcd 's .
like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it .
from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to .
2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .
for an early christmas gift , i got a zen xtra 40 gb player .
i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all .
great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !
when the previous versions of the zens were shipped with musicmatch , people had this problem because musicmatch creates both sets of tags , which seem to confuse the zen xtra .
i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n't do it !
the software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience .
minor gripe .
not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording
the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .
they authorized my late return , and hopefully they are giving apex heck .
i definately recommend a large memory card .
most people say buy an ipod , but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery .
i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose .
meaning i do n't have to manually clear the list , and then load the new list .
controls are a bit awkward .
i needed something with more power , so i bought a nikon coolpix 4300 .
the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .
highly recommended !
they would n't repair my camera unless if i pay $ 100 for parts ? and labor !
it did have scored over all other competitors ....
this did not give me enough control .
choosing zennx is a no-brainer when factoring in the cost of a new $ 400 + ipod every few years versus the $ 50 cost of replacing zennx 's rechargeable battery .
just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date .
am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !
the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .
get better headphones .
this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. .
4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery 's out is not included , although one can be purchased separately .
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player.for the first three hours , and then it died .
i have not yet discovered the internet features yet , which i will be doing soon .
i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered .
the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera .
if you can get this phone for cingular or at&t , go with the other carriers .
it 's not a big deal for me .
just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it 's done !
i love all of the features , and presets as well .
i wanted a dvd player that had basic features and would be able to play dvd - r format disc 's that i had made myself .
i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .
lastly , ipod / itunes will not play wma formatted songs .
loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well .
they fall in love with the product .
everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
i 've even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive .
the first one we installed did n't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least .
the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .
i just got it today and have tried to verify the claims of other reviewers .
this camera has a major design flaw .
buyer beware ! sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly ( maybe this applies to other players too , and not just the nomad , i do n't know ) .
i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;
although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
- the unit is easy to use and intuitive .
one broke , one got stolen , and then i bought the riovolt sp - 350 .
got way too many blurry pictures .
you can find any song quicky by an artist , album , or genre search .
nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .
software - the software is crap .
get it , it 's woth every penny ! !
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .
and no t-zones .
( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )
for work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well .
the buttons and interface are very easy to use .
each of the 4 lasted less than six months .
i ended up sending the unit back to amazon .
i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .
no big deal for the size . .
size and weight :
it ships with a carrying case that has a belt clip on it .
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .
then it rips the tunes into mp3s and puts them on your computer .
btw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information .
a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )
i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one .
i love the eos based controls and easy menus .
most of these " annoyances " , though , are comparable to what you 'll find on other cameras in this price range .
following my research , i decided on the g3 .
after having had my heart broken by a sexy piece of hardware that simply would n't perform .
creative tech support operators work 9-6 p.m. weekdays - as if i had time during work hours to spend time on this .
buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever .
i purchased this phone after having been an at &#38; t subscriber with a nokia 8260 phone for over three years .
do n't waste time looking at anything else , just buy this one .
reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
since the ipod lacks this review feature on its auto-sync and it only allows one-way transfers , the first time i connected my ipod to my laptop , i wiped out the 20gb of music i had transferred from my desktop to the ipod .
a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names .
i got the 40gb jukebox zen xtra for christmas .
i highly regret trying to save a few $ with this purchase .
i am new to the whole digital camera thing ; well , new to the whole camera thing period , really .
i waited a few years between phones , mostly because ( like most i think ) i didnt really need one .
in two transfer batches ( first was english songs , then foreign languages ) , it did n't come up with any errors ( aside the duplicate name i mentioned ).
maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again .
the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place .
apex is made in usa and is one of the underrated brands out there .
no way , now i have an ipod and i 'm a very happy man .
my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months .
if the dvd is stopped , it will display " playback only " .
dont let the bad reviews of the software change your mind .
i did quite a bit of research before buying this camera , and this one had everything i was looking for .
it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .
the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual .
surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .
short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .
the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .
i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .
the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .
3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .
when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good !
me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) .
the service from t-mobile is very good too .
the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better .
this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it .
if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300 , i would order another just like it .
i paid twenty dollars more than the current price , and even then it was a steal .
bait and switch .
there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted .
the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist , track name and album name .
that is , if a folder on your computer called " mp3 " has slayer ( thrash metal ) , stravinsky ( classical ) , and ice cube ( rap ) in it , you will only be able to play the contents of that folder by searching for the artists or genres manually .
as i emailed to the the customer service department , the only thing this player has done consistantly is use enought electricity to keep the red led burning .
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .
i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .
again had to remove the battery .
depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .
so far so good , no problems , no conversions .
and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ).
the 20 gig ipod still goes for just under $ 400 .
what kind of a company does that !
there are no other aftermarket cases available for this model yet , so you have to live with it .
but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera .
the pro ...
but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything .
sure enough there is no such ability .
the canon g3 .
3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players
this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways .
some of the great gains over g2 --
it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves .
i got weird messages about it not being ok 'd by microsoft ( or something like that ) , then i thought it failed to load , then it loaded .
also , if i want a family plan , which mean i need tw phones on a plan .. .
the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad .
nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .
i guess you get what you pay for .
2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )
i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution .
good points :
6 . the g2 's " color effect " exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable " effect func " menu option available in all exposure modes .
zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .
definetely a great camera .
right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras .
i recently bought the nomad jukebox zen xtra , and did n't even get as far as charging the battery .
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .
nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad , which imho is totally unnecessary .
for example , i tried playing my new " pirates of the carribean " extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it .
the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .
yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .
i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .
still , apple continues to squeeze dollars from consumers by not designing the battery to be replaceable .
it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .
the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .
a nice camera bag , which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger .
i own a 35mm slr camera and this is my second digital .
just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .
great phone , i 'd buy another .
i purchased this as a christmas gift for my husband .
now i may buy two !
this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features .
the p/n button switches your dvd players video output signal between pal and ntsc .
once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .
if anybody knows of a remote to work this-i 'd love to hear from you !
the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .
if you buy the stereo headset , you will enjoy it much more .
what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .
however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .
for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds .
this is the 4 apex player that i have bought .
can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go .
my room is so dark and when i tried taking pics of it with my old camera , they came out black , but with this , they look the same in the picture as in real life .
finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me !
here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :
however , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution .
i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .
that 's what i did and hopes this helps .
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .
this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .
apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy .
but that 's a moot point now .
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .
i can 't simply bring up my entire list of songs , click play , and then hit next .
now i have not owned other mp3 players as i was waiting until they matured , but since i received it as a gift i now have this one .
pass this player up , and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas !
the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .
features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names .
i am a software engineer and if i wrote an interface to my software that worked like this , there would be hell to pay , not to mention the ridicule from my peers .
transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 .
getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .
in general it is easy to use and well laid out .
here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far :
regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop .
1 ) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive .
i was cruising around the device within 20 minutes .
i would n't gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas .
however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips .
what a disappointment .
the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !
i bought the apex ad-2600 because of the ability to play jpegs and it seemed like it was the most bang for the buck .
or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe .
that takes up half the space of mp3 's .
it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !
as said before this works perfectly .
the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .
this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap .
i have used this phone for two months now .
we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work " apex " dvd players and none worked .
if you have any multi-disc box sets , you 'll notice that the artist 's name , album name , and genre will often change with every disc .
amazon has been working with me to refund my money , but they reminded me that i have past the 30 day return policy and this was a courtesy return .
i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !
( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . )
its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .
this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas .
no difference .
i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .
although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .
after much frustration ( above ) i found the notmad explorer ; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer & organization problems .
mixed bag i guess but the price was right .
they play just about everything , but # 2 and # 3 died very shortly after getting them .
in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk .
still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera .
it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .
this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .
i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds .
oh ... one more thing .
you might think you are saving money by buying an apex but in the long run you will spend more .
the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel
the way to fix this is to rename the track by adding a number yourself to the end of the track listing .
here 's why :
the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .
creative provided e-mail support ;
upon inspection i did find a small scratch on the surface and figured that to be the cause .
my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !
the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad .
if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one .
from there , you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player ( with the help of the media sniffer .. . read the manual ).
there 's a dent on the upper-back-right and lower-back-right corners ... not too obvious unless you 're up close .
it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .
i bought this only to have it break within a month .
all of the zens use a standard notebook drive .
so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty !
got a great deal from a reputable seller .
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .
if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera .
not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .
it has a nice color screen .
wish it included somebody to re-rip all the songs .
recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .
i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along .
i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) .
it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .
so i 'm screwed .
is this possible to fix , if so how , if not does notmad explorer from red chair software do this ?
the trouble shooting section in the user 's manual , suggesting correct and secure connections , does n't help .
i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .
i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable ( 49.99 @ nokiausa.com or t-mobile.com ) press dial up on my laptop ( by the way it is a mac pb 1gz. and in a matter of seconds i can access my email , fax , and the entire web from my truck !
overall an excellent phone .
3 ) 4x zoom is nice
and go from there ... if you chose one of the " all " options , then you do n't need to do anything until it 's done .
seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection .
in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % .
it makes the dvd player to switch between interlace mode and progressive scan mode .
i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price .
a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .
i tried re-setting it , i tried just about every pair of headphones in my house ( 10 pairs ) , and nothing worked .
you have to add them to the playing list .
1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .
now i need to buy myself another one !
i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .
i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem .
it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .
i hope my next player doesnt breakdown . .
at my heaviest usage , i must recharge after 3 days .
hope someone else has better luck !
i 've tried someone elses and the same thing happens .
usability ( button usage , feature selection , menu structure , display size and quality ) also has good feedback .
i 'd always eyed the nokia phones and had heard decent things about t-mobile , so i gave it a whirl .
my gut tells me i 'll also end up buying an ipod .
using this method , i have not once encountered a situation where a track was rejected , and i have plenty of duplicate tracks on live and compilation albums .
i bought an ipod and am very happy with it .
the good news is if you can 't get it to reset / reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it .
all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
so far i 've played regular dvd 's , backup dvd-r 's , mp3 cd 's , and regular cd 's .
connecting the same outputs to a video card in my computer , there was sound but still no picture .
i can do that myself .
- well-backlit keypad
about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc .
i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out .
amazon is awaesome !
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .
well that is not true .
i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .
another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it .
what a mistake !
if i knew then what i know now i would have paid the extra to get an ipod & avoided the zen .
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .
the service from the supplier was exceptional .
it did lock up on me a couple of times .
in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .
the screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it .
great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes
this player seems to work fine with everything else .
it was always after it finished a process or something , so it did n't cause any file errors .
i 've tried several dvd 's and even new ones do the same thing .
but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle .
i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow !
these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .
neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying - i 've been waiting 27 days . )
started ripping and transferring .
it using something called ac3 ( at least the trial song i purchased was in this format ) which is not a compatible format for the nomad .
before jumping on the ipod train , take a look at this marvel .
* removable battery
if it can fit in the drive bay , this dvd player will play it .
i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .
and then it breaks .
i cancelled the order .
for the money , get a better quality player .
the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything .
if you purchase this product , definitely rip your songs through windows media player .
if you have windows me you should upgrade to xp anyway , lol .
basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 .
these are the reasons i think it 's great :
i should have looked at it harder .
the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) .
anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix .
the little digital elphs were the best-designed , most-elegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them .
i got this phone in t-mobile 's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal .
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .
it will read and play all cd audio disc .
if you 're copying cds with windows media , its really simple to give your songs id3 tags , so thats what i do .
nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke .
thank you !
i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing .
if my level of care was n't good enough , i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two .
i also had it happen when recording a jazz set where there were a number of outtakes of the same song without numbering them separately .
i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft .
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .
ease of use :
read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !
they said it is in stock , but they are " too busy " .
it worked good for a while .
here 's a basic run-down from what i learned :
this product is too fragile for normal use .
have had problems since the first day
it really does n't make any cents $ $ to build a great reputation then destroy it from lack a research and testing in one season .
what is up .
the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more .
at $ 49 .
i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .
the remote is a little hard to understand .
otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward .
otherwise , be smart , save the cash .
the device is larger than an ipod of similar capacity .
both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice .
the radio feature has superb sound quality .
one thing that i found out recently is that you do n't need t-zones from tmobile to go online .
different people have different needs , of course , but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive .
prior to my switch to t-mobile , sprint was my service provider .
after os froze twice on me in the subway i returned the jukebox .
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .
now as others said , so far this player is an awesome player , there are flaws .
the ipod is a one way only machine - from computer to player .
this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .
radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpiece in .
thats it .
zens rule .
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .
it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .
that player is a complete piece of sh ***.
the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint .
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic !
* protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window .
apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .
sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .
what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .
the longest that i have n't charged it was maybe 3 days and that 's turning it off every now and then .
if you want the other accessories the ipod offer , maybe that 's where you should go .. .
also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) .
another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .
it 's worth it .
you can also create your own if you do n't like their classifications .
the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use .
now my dissapointments .
the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .
the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .
i guess you get what you pay for .
i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box .
zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .
it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone .
if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating .
10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc. , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter .
the dvd player does not work properly .
owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide .
the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .
always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .
but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !
i 'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i 've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top , but that does n't stop me from loving this camera .
i purchased the ad2600 after feeling comfortable with the reviews i read here on amazon .
even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them .
like most people , i do n't want to read the instructions , i just want to use it .
so you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter , but you do n't get the quality from a true line out jack .
i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .
( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too .
excellent range of metering options as well .
my pda becames a digital album .
and how can i do that ... .
be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries .
i have my mp3 's stored on my workstation .
and most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase .
and man ... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player ... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title ..
no line out jack - as i said , there is none .
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .
this would have been much easier .
it was marked up increadably high compared to other models ( almost $ 500 for a 30gb ) , and theres was nothing about it that made it worth that much money .
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !
one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .
almost there .
it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .
i was surprised by t-mobile 's service .
the camera was a marvel .
the only good thing about this whole process , is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back , because of the price difference between when i bought it , and now .
