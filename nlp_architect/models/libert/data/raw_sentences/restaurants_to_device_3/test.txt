these are minor problems , and i list them to save anyone else the trouble of discovering them .
we also looked at the fuji fps602 .
( good going , amazon ).
for three months , i 've researched the internet and magazines , queried various sales personnel , and took hands-on in-store test drives .
now what about the flash problem ?
win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs .
those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry .
9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .
it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice .
so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price !
i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags .
however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .
i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) .
it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ).
the bottom line :
to say the least , i was horribly dissatisified with my service with sprint , which was why t-mobile was so fantastically refreshing .
cheaper in every way .
1 ) fm receiver - some models out there have this .
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .
this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .
the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .
great quality picture and features .
you will be told goldstar codes work , and you will be told zenith codes will work , and radio shack will give you apex codes but they will not work .
so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again .
it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .
everything else about the camera is great .
i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .
negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .
i do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand .
while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd .
getting the printer to help output them was another tale .
i had no problems following their installation instructions .
whatever you do , do n't buy this product .
at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .
thank you very much , and go out and get yourself a nomad !
+ you can have different kind of lens if you want + flashes , etc.
i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy .
you can always spend more money to get a better one .
i even went as far as calling the technical support number on the disc .
there was no distortion and it sounded great , especially with eax environmental audio enabled .
- no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking
6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .
first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .
-- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library .
i am back to using # 1 .
this is a great camera for you !
it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs .
while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better .
the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .
the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .
progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) .
nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .
the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .
i am going to have to try an online download and see if that works .
you 're talking totally different hardware .
if you have any doubts about this player , well do n't .
poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .
battery life is ok .
you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost .
sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task .
cameras capture moments .
however , the music and data are apparently not separated ; ipod reviewers complain about " white noise " in random feedback mode that comes from appointments / contacts created on the ipod during synchronization .
i wanted it to shoot concerts as well .
so what ?
they refunded my $ $ $ so fast and paid for the shipping back .
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again .
you can get a pretty good progressive scan sony or toshiba now for 68 bucks just about anywhere .
but for $ 49.99 go get one !
on my relatively new computer ( p4 with windows xp and usb 2.0 ) , the os complained about the installation of the drivers .
every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .
i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective .
if you tossed it out the window , you need to fetch it .
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it .
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .
i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged .
7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .
through the software you can classify songs in genres .
with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .
i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .
i expect the g3 will please me for years to come .
way less expensive than the ipod .
however , the ad-2600 does n't have this feature ( for now ) .
installed software .
now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos .
the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ahwile .
" check out " !
the build quality feels solid , it does n't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd5.1 sound good ) .
it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .
i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .
the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road !
i simply love this feature .
i have it connected to speakers for a nice musical alarm in the morning .
the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only .
in fact , my boyfriend is now going to invest into one of these suckers as well ... now he realizes that this is the best choice over his current archos and the ipod he was eyeing .
i 've bought 3 apex dvd players now .
i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) .
the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
i just got a 40gb ipod to replace my zen ( a 20gb model ) .
you do n't have this problem if you make your playlist from the nomad , where cds are listed separately .
you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it .
that 's important because i have a lot of music .
i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .
they stop time .
make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !
it is an extremely cool gizmo .
plays them all .
i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera .
also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .
none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers - you cannot make changes on the ipod that are premanent .
-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).
output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold .
i treat the battery well and it has lasted .
that said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory .
once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player .
i 've compared and compared and compared .
ok , im writing yet another review , about a week from my previous one .
the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .
the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try .
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it .
i wish i could give negative stars !
but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. .
boy was i wrong .
oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .
this is a great investment for someone like me who enjoys music and hates carrying multiple cds .
it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .
4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .
do n't walk , run and buy this camera if you have the budget , i guarantee you will not be disappointed .
second , the " automatic " sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .
i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones .
personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice .
the cd just has too many problems with win xp .
worked for two weeks .
i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case .
now where did i put that manual ?
this phone is highly recommended otherwise .
great feature list , poor reliability .
a few things that might make it even better :
i would say that this is not a major issue , but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things .
whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together .
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll .
i 've yet to be dissappointed .
structurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you .
it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket .
i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember :
when i hit " menu " it told me , " playback only . "
personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more .
the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .
canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
- uploading music is quick and easy .
in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .
anybody can explain that ?
amazon.com promptly refunded my money for the first one , because a replacement was not available ( thanks amazon.com !
the ipod is also an attractable piece , being lightweight and small .
the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .
oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone , but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam .
speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .
i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .
i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift .
here 's something you have to know before you considering about buying this one .
i can 't imagine why i would spend hundreds of dollars more to have an ipod .
i first bought a 6 gig nomad jukebox ( original ).
i do n't really like bounce .
it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !
from what i 've heard it 's at least equal .
i highly recommend the accessory kit , which provides you with everything else you need :
but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .
artist , album and genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player , and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory .
nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality .
recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
i bought this player during a christmas sale at an excellent price .
my story is based on personal usage .
we ordered two apex ad-2600 's for our family for christmas - finally decided to join the rest of the world and watch dvd 's - well .
great features .. .
this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cdr / cdrw / dvdr / dvdrw , and of course plays dvd movies from uk. i love the aiff , progressive scan feature .
the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .
small problem .
24 hours ?
it 's money down the drain .
i 'm really happy with this purchase .
we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken .
if you really need to save , buy this thing on amazon , they eventually gave me a full refund .
i would recommend replacing the existing software with the " notmad explorer , " which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .
although you may think you 're dealing with amazon , you 're dealing with some second rate store that you 've never heard of .
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying .
did i mention i 've already dropped it once ?
my sister has this series of phone and she loves the radio and headset .
try to buy a high capacity ultra card , as it 's 2x as faster as the regular cf card .
so what 's the problem ?
a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .
this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 's large mobile screen helps with this .
the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked .
well thats about it , and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up , stil havent happened to me , and i hope it doesnt .
the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .
there was neither picture nor sound .
the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .
being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .
after " loading " for what seemed like a very long time , the display indicated " no disk " .
seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) .
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc .
also , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability .
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad .
i am averaging 4.5 mb per song , to give you an idea of how many songs you can get by the amount of memory .
i have tried the belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter but found there was too much interference .
this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500 .
i got one of these to serve as a second dvd player in my house .
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .
having my entire music collection is great when travelling ( both on plane and car trips ) and i do n't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it 's all there .
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .
friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it .
i have had it lock up after a transfer of music .
it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .
they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply .
some things that i did n't like ( but hey . nothing is perfect ).
after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for .
therefore im saying im returning it right now , and i will see wat happens with my next zen xtra ( same replacement ) .
first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .
the visceral teases include the case , the sound quality , and the capacity .
great job canon !
color screen is good .
but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .
it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to " get into " it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .
that does n't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability .
but i did n't because i 'm used to electronic products having a 12 month warranty .
( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .
every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone .
i think the reson for the creative being larger is for sound dampening and protection , whihc is a plus , but then again it is only speculation .
i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any product ) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes .
the prints are beautiful !
that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw .
the sony ericsson phone ( t610 ) has the most whistles and bells , but is also the hardest to use .
i purchased one of these to replace an ailing dvd player that 's a few years old .
simple to use and hook up .
but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes .
the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code , but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go .
this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .
friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased .
i read reviews , compared specs , and visited user forums .
unfortunately it turns out to be the " disposable " type .
the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .
as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine .
the g2 was better in this respect .
veteran zen users have explained how to stop if that 's what you want .
they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .
uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .
it plays all my back-ups , + or - , and everything else i have put in it without a hick up .
it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set .
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .
from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles .
its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .
navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .
to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power .
i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy .
many reviewers refer to it as " clunky " or " difficult " - heed their warnings .
you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly .
the comments i 've read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remote.for instance , pushing the button to play pal ( european type ) movies , when an ntsc ( usa type ) movie disk is in the disk tray .
an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper .
assuming you have filled in all the id3 tags on your mp3s , you will not have any problem finding them on your zen xtra .
( 28 not 30 because software itself takes space ) .
this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .
after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends , i bought this nokia 6610 .
some amazon reviewers say it corrrupted their music files ;
the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .
i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway .
while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .
this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks .
if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .
first let me give you the bad things :
print those coupons twice for two phones ?
i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon .
i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards .
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play .
using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account .
maybe it 's good for tvs with not so good color settings , but not good for my tv that already has very vibrant pictures .
and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
they told me i would have to connect to my laptop , which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email .
it is easy to " focus " in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .
3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .
now getting back to this .
thankfully amazon has free return shipping !
the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .
this almost made it worth the price alone .
it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .
and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .
+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit
i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .
i have not yet tried the cd-ripping program .
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used .
it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
if creative offered a 12-month warranty on their mp3 players , i 'd be covered .
it wo n't play 80 % of my movies , which are all store boughten .
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .
so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad .
the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .
because this camera is beautiful .
for other problems go to http://www.apexdigitalinc.com/support.asp
very simple to use .
the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small .
i purchased it at a retail store , and got an extended warranty .
at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my " alias " dvds as well .
at this time , i decided to turn the player on , and much to my surprise it comes with quite the little library of classical music , one of which is a childhood favorite , bach 's air .
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .
i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it !
after receiving the box from amazon , i proceeded with charging the unit for the specified 4 hours , after which i installed the software and connected the unit to my pc via usb 2.0 .
it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory ( smaller / lighter ) and the 30gb uses a hard drive .
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting .
5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .
your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment .
people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .
their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .
lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage .
- very long-lasting battery life
creative is talking about updating it via firmware , however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players , looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates , not too much of new features .
bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better .
overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !
you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country .
this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny !
overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it .
door broke after a month .
without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
i applied a $ 25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying $ 29 for this machine .
this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !
there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote .
i was planning on getting an ipod , but i changed my mind last minute ... mostly because of the whole battery issue , i do n't have the patience for those sorta things .
recently , i attended a " flyball " competition
it suppose to play everything .
it is crystal clear .
the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
i like the default blue .
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .
compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck .
had to buy my dad a different dvd player locally ( panasonic ) which worked just fine .
spend the extra 20 $ and buy a name brand dvd player .
i can 't fit all that resolution ( 4mp = 2272x 1704 resol . ) in my 19in flat monitor ( 1200x1024 resol . ) anyways .
i thought it would be haggard but when i be gotted this junky i was mad happy and stuff .
be forewarned .
basic shipping was a bit slow , but that 's okay .
i do n't care how it looks and i always drive so the size is not important to me .
the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool .
still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features !
i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com .
i guess that i can not complain since it does not actually claim to play vcd / svcd formats , but others say they can .
it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes .
beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .
it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .
the more i work with it , the more i love it !
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .
battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargebles , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .
i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera .
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !
nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .
cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack .
i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive .
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .
lastly , you cannot manage anything on the ipod itself .
the nokia , samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do n't talk too much .
there are n't many reviews for the iriver ihp .
i 'll state up front that i do not own a zen xtra and have not used one at all .
if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ).
the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .
though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display " lens " when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself .
- some features in the user interface
i shopped around for a month looking for a good mp3 player , and all i heard was how good the i-pod was .
great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .
you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .
i was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base .
just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc.
the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .
the pros and cons of it :
the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .
bought the apex ad-2600 from amazon in 12/03 mainly on price , $ 49.99 - $ 10 rebate = $ 39.99 .
( but as any hard drive , all of them freeze at certain points )
the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .
after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews .
i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus .
since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work " in 24 hours " .
ps : ( mediasource provides similar functions with ms mediaplay such like cd ripping , tagging , music database managing , music file transfering , and more )
no picture :
i would rate this is 4.5 stars picture quality ; image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix .
also , if i had already loaded and tagged by cds on my home computer , this would not have been an issue .
and so far , i 've been very pleased .
there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .
i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .
well , this apex dvd player turned out great !
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e. , mp3s ) .
you should update the firmware before upgrading the drivers if you decide you need the newer drivers for the pc.
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .
it says i have a harddisk problem .
the i/p button switches the tv display between interlace and progressive .
prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture .
was i just unlucky at that moment ?
i have read a lot of the reviews and my phone does not have a hiss or anything that people are talking about .
this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket .
you could have paid more and got a lot less .
i feel that once i contact amazon that they will get to the bottom of this .
the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .
i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .
the flap completely covers the screen because there is no window to see it .
my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .
third party software to the rescue
all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet ; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while .
go for it ...
if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .
but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately .
i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally .
while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .
my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .
the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know .
overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .
i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .
ipod has no stop button ; when new users mention this ipod veterans call it " unnecessary " and " so 20th century " .
this is possible ! !
i bought coolpix 4300 two months after i had bought canon powershot s400 .
one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) .
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it .
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera ..
you can also delete songs from the player itself , and create playlists - on the fly - on your player .
tech support could n't figure it out and gave up .
frequent signal searches eat up battery power .
eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs ( reviewers figures )
it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade !
only if we could get one camera in it . .
ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet .
i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
the pc quickly picked up on it and attempted to install the software , which failed , as creative chose not to follow microsoft standards , whatever .
you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .
this dvd play is basicly junk .
the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers .
the second one was the 2500 which i think is better than the 2600 because it has more features such as karoake which i do use sometimes for parties .
so i finally gave them a deadline which they said they could meet .
the first one was the 705 which i hacked successfully to play all region dvds and disable macrovision .
after investigating a multitude of player options , i asked for and received the 60 gb zen xtra for christmas .
the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .
we got a familyplan from t-mobile which saves us tons .
but for what i do use it is perfect .
i do n't think i was asking too much .
also , the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with .
made the camera totally inoperable .
first there 's the unit itself .
the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla .
quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .
- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last .
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .
that was a mistake .
you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .
which was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone ...
i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him .
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) .
after reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common .
that way i could keep it in the case all the time .
often i fill i need to have better organization for the library and there is not enought of variables .
buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem ..
transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .
i can only hear the sound .
just make sure the keys are locked .
* price and capacity
save money on the long run - buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month .
the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .
try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .
perhaps there is a tone of irony in the title of my review , but i actually mean it in earnest .
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .
i quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me .
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper .
did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution .
saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable , as i already had a coax cable .
i bought this as a gift for my sister .
as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) .
it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed-light settings .
no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .
here 's a hint : go to nokia.com and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth .
well , anyway i could go on and on on why this player did n't meet my expectations .. .
i personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad .
i went to an at &#38; t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads .
i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it .
other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .
because once the moment is gone , it is not coming back .
all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .
i 've picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful .
i personally do n't like apple or their business practices ( screwing resellers , customers and employees left and right ) so i shopped around for something else .
i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .
i would replace them with some better sounding and more comfortable phones .
the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd .
you will have a very expensive paperweight .
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .
i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .
i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company , some models are better than others .
advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .
there is n't need to get in details again , but just remember it rocks because : price , sound , ease of use , and features .
in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .
the rio karma feedback suffers from sensitivity in the hard disk .
for most people , they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection .
this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure .
the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life .
if the casing of the player is this bad , i can 't image that the hardware is of very good quality .
so if you use your card reader ; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date ; time .
for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price .
songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver .
that 's all for now .
4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .
press the p/n button located on the bottom right corner of the remote .
it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it .
the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .
i was in search of a new item to take it 's place as my new mp3 player / harddrive .
it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . )
i am a soldier serving in baghdad right now .
nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon .
the software , which comes with player is not good at all .
i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .
construction quality is a difficult item .
enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
a great new use for that underutilized computer .
sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization .
pro : 1 .
since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make .
as i travel quite a lot , i 'd want something with gsm as well as cdma tri-band .
- the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .
4 ) it did play my jpeg photos but wow , trying to figure it out was really something !
i tried to play the song three times , with no success .
all rechargeable batteries lose their holding power over time ( around 2 years ) .
5 . the 1/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments .
great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.
messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .
the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .
as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n't had any problems .
and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .
a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards .
i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous .
after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds .
i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it .
it did not lock up my computer or require a reboot .
after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. .
if you have a question , they have the answer .
i 'll admit that i 'd own an ipod if i had money to burn , but for the money this is a much better buy .
this is the second apex dvd player i 've had - and the last .
i bought the apex ad-2600 dvd player for the family for christmas .
some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .
this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver .
with progressive scan , i expect it to play play play - and give my old pioneer a rest .
this gap allowed the front panel to fly off after barely being touched .
while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .
if you are n't into paying $ x00 to learn and experiment , or the cons outweigh the pros , then wait a year or so .
anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception .
- solid , high-quality construction
i used it lightly , and it lasted just over one year ( forgot to kill the power one day , and now it only plays dvds ).
in addition , you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player .
you are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player .
so , if you read the instructions well , you should n't have any problems with this dvd unit .
80 % of the features on here you will not get by spending $ 100 on a sony or panasonic .
update : january 27th 2004 - the second one crapped out only after a week - dont buy this product !
the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key ) .
but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .
my favorite is to play " any track " - am rediscovering my music !
perhaps there is a way around this delay .
if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual .
the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .
we saw reviews that said the same thing , and also saw here that their customer service stinks .
also , it was only $ 39.99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player .
a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer .
also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .
the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc. other nicities , that you would enjoy .
clearly a large lawsuit if i were so inclined .
i also did n't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode .
i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one .
this is one of those items that , at first glance , looked cool but did n't really ring a bell with me .
yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway .
you can change any of these , but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it .
overall , a very disappointing product .
another stupid move .
if it does , ill give up .
no instructions .
i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept .
+ screen was good , easy to read
two days later the phone was returned to me in complete working order .
i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died .
that is a very nice feature .
canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .
even viewed cds full of jpgs .
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .
i like the speakphone function a lot .
yes , i recommend it over the competition .
i followed their advice but that failed , too .
use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) .
i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :
unlike some of the other people who received a " lemon " , my dvd player came in perfect working condition .
- no propietary headset jack
you have to skip to the next track when your hated song comes up with the ipod .
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong .
if you have two tracks with exactly the same name on one disk , it will not copy both -- it gives you the option of skipping the second or overwriting the first with the second .
some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get .
my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity .
so if you have xp , be prepared for this and do n't be alarmed .
if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books .
it happened to me once .
the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .
the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .
however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much .
have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital.com ) , but the e-mail address is not valid .
if you are planning to buy that player , do not !
i realize this is for quality assurance purposes , but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered ( i.e. me :
no contact phone number , only eamil contact which did not respond me .
for ipod you have to buy a cable and it is n't compatible with all windows pcs.
the pictures are amazing .
if you plan to carry the device around ( it is a mobile device , right ? ) then this is something you might want to think about .
if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk .
i just used the explorer program to move my songs to my player .
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .
point the " media sniffer " to your music files and let it do the rest .
i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition .
the player 's mechanics are also flawed .
this does n't affect the picture , of course .
after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package .
any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor , along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support .
either way , can 't go wrong with this price .
so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .
his i-pod can only play for a couple of hours with a fully recharging now .
the volume .
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --
and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod .
i 'm not sure why people have problems with either the interface of the nomad , or the software that comes with the unit .
otherwise it 'll get there the day you get back from the hospital !
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .
i love the storage in this thing .
so consider what you 're going to use the device for .
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user-friendly player imo .
if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you .
the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .
5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .
find another phone , or buy this one in its manufacturer-unlocked form .
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
drop if just a few inches on a hard surface and the faceplate pops off ( but not if it 's in its case ) .
the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough .
the movie mode is also working great .
i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name .
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .
do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype .
3 . i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although , i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings .
this phone plays up to 4 tones at one time and it actually sounds like music .
for a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones .
it defaulted to unchangeable email .
but who wants the wires involved .
but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback .. . i can 't recommend this product .
i transfered all 16 gigs in 15 minutes without any errors via firewire .
to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press " menu " on the remote while the dvd is playing .
big mistake .
one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like .
fair warning - do not buy .
i doubt anyone has ever seen an add or commercial for any other mp3 player .
after messing with it at a store i noticed how bad the i-pod was .
updating the unit 's firmware :
so i do n't know what the previous review that could n't do more than 30 songs is talking about .
there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation .
my only significant complaint is sound quality .
i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker .
i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1.2 mb/per .
i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since .
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .
the regular mode in this camera works for 80 % of settings .
ipod users have to send theirs back and pay $ 100 for a replacement .
you can even skip that step and rip them directly from the cd to the player .
i 've called the service number and if it 's not busy , it rings forever then eventually dumps you .
personally , i do n't understand all the complaints about the interface .. .
any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages .
" you can send it in , but i would n't count on ever seeing it or a replacement again .
2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par .
it works great .
maybe i 'll get lucky with the next one .
i knew nothing about dvds before this but with this machine i figured it all out very quickly .
if you thought about getting this phone buy it .
but for now this will do .
3 . that 's pretty much all the negatives the positive things truly outnumber the negatives , and the negatives are n't that bad .
the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .
hope this review has helped you in making up your mind .
it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .
if you 're intrested in buying a spare battery it 'll run you another $ 50 , a little steep i thought .
compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .
both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610 .
my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .
i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .
i 'll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back .
the other company is currently " out of stock " so i ordered another from amazon and will be taking the original back to the competitor today .
first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds .
-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
i have a large collection of cds and have loaded over 100 of them so far .
the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .
relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .
if that one fails too , and i hope if it does , let it happen in the first 90 days , not later , cuz thats the warranty .
my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .
the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) .
this is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining mp3 's in which i would have never purchased the cd .
a great buy .
however , it does n't register instantly as a hard drive like other players .
i took the camera and just gave it to someone .
this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) .
again , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional .
( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however )
if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .
tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent .
in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .
so far not going to get a good review .
i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me .
great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .
well that was not a simple task .
* main dial is not backlit .
bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .
i repeat - do n't wast your money .
and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .
very cheaply made .
better actually cause my carpet looks clean , lol .
3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .
it can get pretty lonely out there .
it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much .
- price : see above .
every t-mobile plan comes with gsm data , meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps ( with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference ) .
however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy .
i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it .
when i turned eax back on the static was also not present .
2 . i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was n't comfortable with that .
so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .
* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .
this is nothing new , every mp3 player , memory card , etc. , used for digital media today has some kind of preloaded operating software on it .
the button on the remote to switch from pal to ntsc was undoubtedly my problem .
i bought the zen xtra 30g as a gift .
i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar .
again , though , it has only been used sparingly .
based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .
the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .
i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy .
the t610 has the most functionality hands down .
it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working .
the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .
3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip .
2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called " unknown . "
i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .
when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .
an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into " out of battery " situation .
because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's .
had this been my only dvd player , though , it would have been a real problem .
several people have complained of difficulty transferring multiple songs with the same title .
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .
2 ) fm transmitter - so you can place the unit in your car and listen to the unit through your car stereo .
gee ... thanks a lot creative .
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal .
it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
i 've been using it for about 3 months now .
the battery recharges real fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .
i did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras .
they look fantastic .
they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling .
the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead .
it has never worked .
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .
i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone .
it is made of plastic .
the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .
it would have been better to have some sort of window on teh carrying case , so you could see the display without opening it .
the pros :
perhaps the weirdest was one of bruce springsteen 's cds from the tracks set being classified as goth rock .
like some other reviewers , i recieved this phone using t-mobiles upgrade program .
please , if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions , i 'm wait very happy .
my 2.6 mhz pentium 4 with usb 2.0 was able to perform the task pretty quickly ( i would estimate ~ 5 - 8 minutes per cd ).
for me , that was the only drawback .
i 've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual .
i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review .
in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .
the less computer-saavy might find apple 's software a bit friendlier , though ( i use it at a friend 's house and it does do a lot more for you . )
the camera has a wonderful set of features .
my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up .
i 've compared this phone to others such as 6100 , siemens sl55 .
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .
i 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder .. .
a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .
battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive
software : for the people who complain about software , please , stop complaining .
it took several days of attempts before things finally " worked " again and i have n't a clue why .
i considered this phone ( nokia 6610 ) , mainly because of my sister and the features .
the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend .
i got mine for $ 160 less than the ipod 30gb ( got an extra $ 30 off for applying for an amazon visa ... thanks amazon ! )
i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service .
overall i 'm happy with my toy .
it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .
nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .
the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .
the image quality is excellent .
furher it contains a card reader , a flash card folder for up to 8 cards , a lense cleaning rag , and an ac adapter , which is very helpful when working in an " outlet environment " .
i would not give up this phone for the world .
the top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable .
even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .
after reading all the glowing review on this camera , i went to my local camera shop to try one .
i tried called apex cust service , no help .
now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school !
i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .
while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs , mine has run well , and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase .
it actually gives the option to clear the previous playlist when i want to play another list .
this thing , while looking pretty cool , is not as sexy as the ipod .
i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .
guess where this unit is headed ?
bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it .
the sound from the player is ok .
anything this phone does , it does perfectly .
also bought a soundblaster card that they sold for the mac .
b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display
however , if you are keen , you can attach a camera to this phone .
they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .
i will not be ordering another one to replace it .
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .
if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .
no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic 's for just a couple of keepers .
-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .
i can only hear the sound but no picture !
in the last month i bought the apex ad-1600 and the ad-1220 .
- since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera .
i like the automatic key lock function .
was it a full moon that night ?
this junky is super duper rad. it be my fav c-phone and stuff .
i might have gotten a lemon , but this is not the first report of video output failure on this machine .
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .
i have 100 of my cd 's transferred and have n't made a dent in the 30 gb drive .
also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 " tv ).
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .
but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture .
it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work , because it works on all the other computers i have .
hope i 've been of some help .
i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .
because , you will be dissapointed .
( did i mention you can actually change the battery ? hello ? apple ? are you listening ? )
ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
as mentioned above i broke the player within the 1st 10 days .
it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into .
like i said , when the moment is gone , it is gone .
i have n't used any of them since i got the g3 .
i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly .
2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax .
the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact .
if you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble .
therefore , if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card , even if you unlock the phone , there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet .
then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .
6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .
one minor complaint :
after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support .
take my words and give it a try .
so far i 've only had it since christmas , so i cant tell you much about the battery life .
and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality .
moreover , they want a total of $ 107 to repair it .
the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly
f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course
first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .
i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra .
also , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy .
i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .
instead , i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in .
. this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped .
the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .
although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .
the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !
the only drawbacks that i have noticed :
i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .
i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation .
the phone is very light weight .
i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n't work !
the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .
( i guess only time will tell ? )
anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it .
i am quite happy with the camera .
- excellent sound quality
the dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model .
nokia has definitely won me over with this one .
will never purchase apex again .
connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !
navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .
feels solid in hand .
the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .
the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .
repair seems to be an issue ; some say the repair do n't exist
i discovered this weekend that itunes does not sell mp3 's in the mp3 format .
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
wo n't play a lot of discs .
being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 .
it has many great features and very few bad ones .
you discover this later when you 're listening to a song and it 's the wrong title , causing you to rename everything on your own .
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again .
the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .
i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover .
one thing puzzles me is that for " fine and 2200 + " quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .
my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home , but now she 's forever asking for the digital camera .
even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal .
the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .
i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .
i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card .
i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .
4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much .
recently i accidently washed my telephone with my laundry through two complete 18 minute wash cycles of a washing machine .
else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately " fine **" picture quality " image size : 1600 .
so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem .
- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .
i received this as a gift .
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .
1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 " or 5x7 " prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 " photos once in a while .
5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control .
my choices at that moment were to manually re-tag my music or re-rip using mediasource .
i just got screwed out of fifty bucks .
my personal favorite is the karma ( i currently own a karma , a zen usb 2.0 , a philips hdd100 , and an upgraded 60 gig archos jukebox recorder ).
focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free .
+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
you can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions .
it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .
really happy with this little camera .
if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 !
however , the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems .
that 's the first thing to understand .
you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit
if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 !
these models now ship with creative 's mediasource program , which allows you to highlight the files on your computer that you want to add to your zen xtra , click a button , and transfer it straight to your player .
i was told that it is no longer available , so there must be something really wrong with it .
nokia does not disappoint in this model .
it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .
while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .
grandma in church quiet .
the fact that the " 0 " key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the " # " key instead .
you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .
the battery life on this phone is surreal .
i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it 's job .
well , maybe that particular song was just corrupt , so i tried to upload some of my own , after four attempts , at each one the unit locked up and required a reboot , i managed to upload an album , which albeit was surprisingly fast , however when attempting to create a playlist out of my newly uploaded songs , the nomad again froze up and refused to work .
i have been assured this will be fixed soon .
the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .
sheesh ! !
please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used .
all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift .
there should have been a recall on this product .
forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer .
is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ?
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them .
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen .
do n't waste your time , engery , resources on this thing , just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod .
creative labs customer support website is useless .
the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .
4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .
i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .
the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .
the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive .
